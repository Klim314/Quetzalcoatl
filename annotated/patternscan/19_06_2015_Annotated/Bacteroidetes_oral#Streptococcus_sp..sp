TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == comparison of bacterial community composition of primary and persistent endodontic infections using pyrosequencing.
AB  == introduction: elucidating the microbial ecology of endodontic infections (eis) is a necessary step in developing effective intracanal antimicrobials. the aim of the present study was to investigate the bacterial composition of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary and persistent infections in a greek population using high-throughput sequencing methods. methods: 16s amplicon pyrosequencing of 48 root canal bacterial samples was conducted, and sequencing data were analyzed using an oral microbiome-specific and a generic (greengenes) database. bacterial  abundance and diversity were examined by ei type (primary or persistent), and statistical analysis was performed by using non-parametric and parametric tests accounting for clustered data. results: bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum in both infection groups. significant, albeit weak associations of bacterial diversity were found, as measured by unifrac distances with infection type (analyses of similarity, r = 0.087, p = .005) and symptoms (analyses of similarity, r = 0.055, p = .047). persistent infections were significantly enriched for proteobacteria and tenericutes compared with primary ones; at the genus level, significant differences were noted for 14 taxa, including increased  enrichment of persistent infections for lactobacillus, streptococcus, and sphingomonas. more but less abundant phyla were identified using the greengenes database; among those, cyanobacteria (0.018%) and acidobacteria (0.007%) were significantly enriched among persistent infections. persistent infections showed  higher phylogenetic diversity (pd) (asymptomatic: pd = 9.2, standard error [se] = 1.3; symptomatic: pd = 8.2, se = 0.7) compared with primary infections (asymptomatic: pd = 5.9, se = 0.8; symptomatic: pd = 7.4, se = 1.0). conclusions: the present study revealed a high bacterial diversity of ei and suggests that persistent infections may have more diverse bacterial communities than primary infections.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == periimplant bacteria associated with different transmucosal designs or smoking habits.
AB  == purpose: this study is to compare periimplant microbiota associated with implant  transmucosal designs or smoking habits. methods: submucosal samples from healthy  52 implants were collected for analysis of bacteria associated with bone-level (n = 37) or tissue-level (n = 15) implants or smoking habits, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. profiles of periimplant bacteria of smokers (n = 5) were investigated using phylochip array version g3 and compared with nonsmokers (n = 5). results: the number of bone-level implants positive for at least 1 pathogen was higher than that of tissue level; however, differences in each bacterium were insignificant. the prevalence and abundance of treponema denticola in smokers were significantly higher than that in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). smokers  and nonsmokers exhibited similar periimplant microbiota based on the phylochip array, but they could be distinguished by limiting observations to only 18 operational taxonomic units. streptococcus macedonicus within firmicutes and prevotella within bacteroidetes were more abundant in smokers compared with nonsmokers. conclusion: prevalence of putative pathogens with bone-level implants was higher than tissue-level implants in nonsmokers. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were significantly higher in smokers. smoking therefore strongly influenced peri-implant bacterial composition of bone-level implant.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == extensive description and comparison of human supra-gingival microbiome in root caries and health.
AB  == knowledge of the polymicrobial etiology of root caries is limited. to conduct a comprehensive research study on root caries, we utilized 454-pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene libraries and quantitative pcr to compare supra-gingival bacterial  communities from healthy sites and carious sites of 21 patients with root caries  (patient-controls and patient-cases) and the sites of 21 healthy individuals (healthy-controls) from two nursing homes. healthy-controls and patient-cases showed no significant differences in terms of biomass, species richness, and species diversity. however, as for beta diversity based on either community membership metric (unweighted unifrac) or community structure metric (weighted unifrac), healthy-controls and patient-cases were clearly distinguished from each other, appearing more variable in the community membership and structure in root  caries microbiome but relatively conserved in the health microbiome. the patient-controls group was at an intermediate stage between healthy-controls and  patient-cases, but was more inclined to the former. demonstrated in both relative abundance and prevalence of species in health and root caries, propionibacterium  acidifaciens, streptococcus mutans, olsenella profusa, prevotella multisaccharivorax, and lactobacillus crispatus were found to be most associated  with root caries, whereas delftia acidovorans, bacteroidetes[g-2] sp., lachnospiraceae[g-3] sp., and prevotella intermedia are most associated with health. our study provides a basis for further elucidating the microbial etiology of root caries in the elderly.

TI  == combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of naf/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. the optimal naf/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using  bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic s. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. in addition, the naf/arginine combination synergistically reduced s. mutans but enriched s. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. more importantly, the optimal combination of naf/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe p. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.

TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == silver-zeolite combined to polyphenol-rich extracts of ascophyllum nodosum: potential active role in prevention of periodontal diseases.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate various biological effects of silver-zeolite and a polyphenol-rich extract of a. nodosum (ascop) to prevent and/or treat biofilm-related oral diseases. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii contribute to the biofilm formation associated with chronic periodontitis. in this study, we evaluated in vitro antibacterial and anti-biofilm effects of silver-zeolite (ag-zeolite) combined to ascop on p. gingivalis and s. gordonii growth and biofilm formation capacity. we also studied the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities of ascop in cell culture models. while ag-zeolite combined with ascop was ineffective against the growth of s. gordonii, it showed a strong bactericidal effect on p. gingivalis growth. ag-zeolite combined with ascop was able to completely inhibit s. gordonii monospecies biofilm formation as well as to reduce the formation of a bi-species  s. gordonii/p. gingivalis biofilm. ascop alone was ineffective towards the growth and/or biofilm formation of s. gordonii and p. gingivalis while it significantly  reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (tnfalpha and il-6) by lps-stimulated human like-macrophages. it also exhibited antioxidant properties and decreased lps induced lipid peroxidation in gingival epithelial cells. these  findings support promising use of these products in future preventive or therapeutic strategies against periodontal diseases.

TI  == antibacterial effect of crude extract and metabolites of phytolacca americana on  pathogens responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries.
AB  == background: the oral cavity is the store house of different species of microorganisms that are continuously engaged in causing diseases in the mouth. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of crude  extracts of the aerial parts of phytolacca americana and its natural compounds against two oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans, which are primarily responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental  caries, as well as a nonpathogenic escherichia coli. methods: crude extract and fractions from the aerial parts of p. americana (0.008-1.8 mg/ml) were evaluated  for their potential antibacterial activity against two oral disease causing microorganisms by micro-assays. the standard natural compounds present in p. americana, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, isoqueritrin and ferulic acid, were also tested for their antibacterial activity against the pathogens at  1-8 mug/ml. results: the crude extract was highly active against p. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) and moderately active against s. mutans (44% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/ml. the chloroform and hexane fraction controlled the growth of p. gingivalis with 91% and 92% growth inhibition at a concentration of  0.2 mg/ml, respectively. kaempferol exerted antibacterial activity against both the pathogens, whereas quercetin showed potent growth inhibition activity against only s. mutans in a concentration dependent manner. conclusion: the crude extract, chloroform fraction, and hexane fraction of p. americana possesses active natural compounds that can inhibit the growth of oral disease causing bacteria. thus, these extracts have the potential for use in the preparation of toothpaste and other drugs related to various oral diseases.

TI  == nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of antrodia camphorata extracts against oral bacteria.
AB  == antrodia camphorata (a. camphorata) is a unique, endemic and extremely rare mushroom species native to taiwan, and both crude extracts of and purified chemical compounds from a. camphorata have been reported to have a variety of significant beneficial effects, such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity. however, reports on the effects of a. camphorata against dental pathogens have been limited. oral health is now recognized as important for overall general health, including conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) are the most common bacteria associated  with dental plaque and periodontopathic diseases, respectively. thus, our study examined the ability of five various crude extracts of a. camphorata to inhibit the growth of dental bacteria and anti-adherence in vitro. among the extracts, the ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts exhibited the lowest mics against p. gingivalis and s. mutans (mic = 4 approximately 16 microg/ml). the mic of the aqueous extract was greater than 2048 microg/ml against both p. gingivalis and s. mutans. in vitro adherence of s. mutans was significantly inhibited by the addition of either the ethyl acetate extract or chloroform extract (mic = 16 approximately 24 microg/ml), while the ethanol extract (mic = 32 approximately 64 microg/ml) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity. based on the result of this study, the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of a. camphorata may be good candidates for oral hygiene agents to control dental caries and periodontopathic  conditions.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == effects of streptococcus thermophilus on volatile sulfur compounds produced by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == halitosis as oral malodour is an unpleasant odour caused by volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). vscs are produced primarily by anaerobic bacteria that abundantly produce proteinase as trypsin-like enzyme. general therapies, such as  mouthwash and plaque control, do not provide a continuous effect on oral halitosis. streptococcus thermophilus is a probiotic bacterium that is beneficial for human health. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of s. thermophilus on porphyromonas gingivalis-producing vscs and to analyze the inhibitory mechanism of halitosis. p. gingivalis was cultured with or without s.  thermophilus, and the emission of vscs from the spent culture medium was measured by gas chromatography. in order to analyze the inhibitory effect, the antibacterial activity of s. thermophilus against p. gingivalis was assessed. after the spent culture medium or whole bacterial of s. thermophilus was mixed with the spent culture medium of p. gingivalis, vscs were again measured by gas chromatograph. when s. thermophilus and p. gingivalis were co-cultivated, vscs were present at a lower level than those of single-cultured p. gingivalis. s. thermophilus inhibited growth of p. gingivalis, and the whole bacteria and the spent culture medium of s. thermophilus reduced emission of vscs gas. s. thermophilus may reduce oral malodour by inhibition of p. gingivalis growth and neutralizing vscs with their metabolites or themselves.

TI  == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years.  molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers,  were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious  lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == predicting the influence of multiple components on microbial inhibition using a logistic response model--a novel approach.
AB  == background: there are several synergistic methods available. however, there is a  vast discrepancy in the interpretation of the synergistic results. also, these synergistic methods do not assess the influence the tested components (drugs, plant and natural extracts), have upon one another, when more than two components are combined. methods: a modified checkerboard method was used to evaluate the synergistic potential of heteropyxis natalensis, melaleuca alternifolia, mentha piperita and the green tea extract known as teavigo. the synergistic combination  was tested against the oral pathogens, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia and candida albicans. inhibition data obtained from the checkerboard method, in the form of binary code, was used to compute a logistic response model with statistically significant results (p < 0.05). this information was used to construct a novel predictive inhibition model. results: based on the predictive inhibition model for each microorganism, the oral pathogens tested were successfully inhibited (at 100% probability) with their respective synergistic combinations. the predictive inhibition model also provided information on the influence that different components have upon one another, and on the overall probability of inhibition. conclusions: using the logistic response model negates the need to 'calculate' synergism as the results are statistically significant. in successfully determining the influence multiple components have upon one another and their effect on microbial inhibition, a novel predictive model was established. this ability to screen multiple components may have far reaching effects in ethnopharmacology, agriculture and pharmaceuticals.

TI  == disruption of heterotypic community development by porphyromonas gingivalis with  small molecule inhibitors.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the main etiological organisms in periodontal  disease. on oral surfaces p. gingivalis is a component of multispecies biofilm communities and can modify the pathogenic potential of the community as a whole.  accumulation of p. gingivalis in communities is facilitated by interspecies binding and communication with the antecedent colonizer streptococcus gordonii. in this study we screened a library of small molecules to identify structures that could serve as lead compounds for the development of inhibitors of p. gingivalis community development. three small molecules were identified that effectively inhibited accumulation of p. gingivalis on a substratum of s. gordonii. the structures of the small molecules are derived from the marine alkaloids oroidin and bromoageliferin and contain a 2-aminoimidazole or 2-aminobenzimidazole moiety. the most active compounds reduced expression of mfa1 and fima in p. gingivalis, genes encoding the minor and major fimbrial subunits,  respectively. these fimbrial adhesins are necessary for p. gingivalis co-adhesion with s. gordonii. these results demonstrate the potential for a small molecular inhibitor-based approach to the prevention of diseases associated with p. gingivalis.

TI  == the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis induces expression of transposases and cell death of streptococcus mitis in a biofilm model.
AB  == oral microbial communities are extremely complex biofilms with high numbers of bacterial species interacting with each other (and the host) to maintain homeostasis of the system. disturbance in the oral microbiome homeostasis can lead to either caries or periodontitis, two of the most common human diseases. periodontitis is a polymicrobial disease caused by the coordinated action of a complex microbial community, which results in inflammation of tissues that support the teeth. it is the most common cause of tooth loss among adults in the  united states, and recent studies have suggested that it may increase the risk for systemic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. in a recent series of papers, hajishengallis and coworkers proposed the idea of the "keystone-pathogen" where low-abundance microbial pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis) can orchestrate inflammatory disease by turning a benign microbial community into a dysbiotic one. the exact mechanisms by which these pathogens reorganize the healthy oral microbiome are still unknown. in the present manuscript, we present  results demonstrating that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis death and dna fragmentation in an in vitro biofilm system. moreover, we report here the induction of expression of multiple transposases in a streptococcus mitis biofilm when the periodontopathogen p. gingivalis is present. based on these results, we  hypothesize that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis cell death by an unknown mechanism, shaping the oral microbiome to its advantage.

AB  == interspecies communication between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii underlies the development of synergistic dual species communities. contact with s. gordonii initiates signal transduction within p. gingivalis that  is based on protein tyrosine (de)phosphorylation. in this study, we characterize  a bacterial tyrosine (by) kinase (designated ptk1) of p. gingivalis and demonstrate its involvement in interspecies signaling. ptk1 can utilize atp for autophosphorylation and is dephosphorylated by the p. gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase, ltp1. community development with s. gordonii is severely abrogated in a ptk1 mutant of p. gingivalis, indicating that tyrosine kinase activity is required for maximal polymicrobial synergy. ptk1 controls the levels of the transcriptional regulator cdhr and the fimbrial adhesin mfa1 which mediates binding to s. gordonii. the ptk1 gene is in an operon with two genes involved in  exopolysaccharide synthesis, and similar to other by kinases, ptk1 is necessary for exopolysaccharide production in p. gingivalis. ptk1 can phosphorylate the capsule related proteins pgn_0224, a udp-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase, and pgn_0613, a udp-glucose dehydrogenase, in p. gingivalis. knockout of ptk1 in an encapsulated strain of p. gingivalis resulted in loss of capsule production. collectively these results demonstrate that the p. gingivalis ptk1 by kinase regulates interspecies communication and controls heterotypic community development with s. gordonii through adjusting the levels of the mfa1 adhesin and exopolysaccharide.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == in vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  == purpose: this in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. the role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was  also evaluated. materials and methods: the efficacy of three oral rinses, acclean, noplak and prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an mtt assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an xtt assay. results: the two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio  lm-grown organisms when compared to the prevention oral rinse. conclusion: both acclean and noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. in addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.

TI  == plaque bacterial microbiome diversity in children younger than 30 months with or  without caries prior to eruption of second primary molars.
AB  == objective: our primary objective is to phylogenetically characterize the supragingival plaque bacterial microbiome of children prior to eruption of second primary molars by pyrosequencing method for studying etiology of early childhood  caries. methods: supragingival plaque samples were collected from 10 caries children and 9 caries-free children. plaque dna was extracted, used to generate dna amplicons of the v1-v3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene, and subjected to 454-pyrosequencing. results: on average, over 22,000 sequences per sample were generated. high bacterial diversity was noted in the plaque of children with caries [170 operational taxonomical units (otu) at 3% divergence] and caries-free children (201 otu at 3% divergence) with no significant difference. a total of 8 phyla, 15 classes, 21 orders, 30 families, 41 genera and 99 species were represented. in addition, five predominant phyla (firmicute, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria) and seven genera  (leptotrichia, streptococcus, actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, neisseria,  and veillonella) constituted a majority of contents of the total microbiota, independent of the presence or absence of caries. principal component analysis (pca) presented that caries-related genera included streptococcus and veillonella; while leptotrichia, selenomonas, fusobacterium, capnocytophaga and porphyromonas were more related to the caries-free samples. neisseria and prevotella presented approximately in between. in both groups, the degree of shared organism lineages (as defined by species-level otus) among individual supragingival plaque microbiomes was minimal. conclusion: our study represented for the first time using pyrosequencing to elucidate and monitor supragingival plaque bacterial diversity at such young age with second primary molar unerrupted. distinctions were revealed between caries and caries-free microbiomes in terms of microbial community structure. we observed differences in abundance for several microbial groups between the caries and caries-free host populations, which were consistent with the ecological plaque hypothesis. our approach and findings could be extended to correlating microbiomic changes after occlusion establishment and caries treatment.

TI  == the anti-adhesive mode of action of a purified mushroom (lentinus edodes) extract with anticaries and antigingivitis properties in two oral bacterial phatogens.
AB  == background: in previous works we have shown that a low-molecular-mass (lmm) fraction from mushroom (lentinus edodes) homogenate interferes with binding of streptococcus mutans to hydroxyapatite and prevotella intermedia to gingival cells. additionally, inhibition of biofilm formation of both odonto- and periodonto-pathogenic bacteria and detachment from preformed biofilms have been described for this compound. further purification of mushroom extract has been recently achieved and a sub-fraction (i.e. # 5) has been identified as containing the majority of the mentioned biological activities. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacterial receptors for the purified mushroom sub-fraction #5 in order to better elucidate the mode of action of this compound when interfering with bacterial adhesion to host surfaces or with bacteria-bacteria interactions in the biofilm state. methods: candidate bacterial molecules to act as target of  this compound were bacterial surface molecules involved in cell adhesion and biofilm formation, and, thus, we have considered cell wall associated proteins (cwps), teichoic acid (ta) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) of s. mutans, and outer membrane proteins (omps) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. intermedia. results:  fifteen s. mutans cwps and ta were capable of binding sub-fraction #5, while lta  did not. as far as p. intermedia is concerned, we show that five omps interact with sub-fraction # 5. capacity of binding to p. intermedia lps was also studied  but in this case negative results were obtained. conclusions: binding sub-fraction # 5 to surface molecules of s. mutans or p. intermedia may result in inactivation of their physiological functions. as a whole, these results indicate, at molecular level, the bacterial surface alterations affecting adhesion and biofim formation. for these antimicrobial properties, the compound may find use in daily oral hygiene.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == pyrano-isoflavans from glycyrrhiza uralensis with antibacterial activity against  streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == continuing investigation of fractions from a supercritical fluid extract of chinese licorice (glycyrrhiza uralensis) roots has led to the isolation of 12 phenolic compounds, of which seven were described previously from this extract. in addition to these seven metabolites, four known components, 1-methoxyerythrabyssin ii (4), 6,8-diprenylgenistein, gancaonin g (5), and isoglycyrol (6), and one new isoflavan, licorisoflavan c (7), were characterized  from this material for the first time. treatment of licoricidin (1) with palladium chloride afforded larger amounts of 7 and also yielded two new isoflavans, licorisoflavan d (8), which was subsequently detected in the licorice extract, and licorisoflavan e (9). compounds 1-9 were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against the cariogenic streptococcus mutans and the periodontopathogenic porphyromonas gingivalis. licoricidin (1), licorisoflavan a  (2), and 7-9 showed antibacterial activity against p. gingivalis (mics of 1.56-12.5 mug/ml). the most potent activity against s. mutans was obtained with 7 (mic of 6.25 mug/ml), followed by 1 and 9 (mic of 12.5 mug/ml). this study provides further evidence for the therapeutic potential of licorice extracts for  the treatment and prevention of oral infections.

TI  == prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. in  this study, we examined the synergic effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. the synergic effects of the supernatant of p. intermedia (pisup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (a549) cells by pisup was assessed. the effects of pisup on platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. mice inoculated with s. pneumoniae plus pisup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without pisup. in a549 cells, pisup increased pneumococcal adhesion and pafr transcript levels. pisup also increased  lung pafr transcript levels in mice. similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum. thus, p. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine o on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

TI  == [efficacy of taurine haloamines and chlorhexidine against selected oral microbiome species].
AB  == introduction: uncontrolled bacteria of dental plaque generate formation of oral biofilm located on teeth and subgingival surfaces. it may induce local inflammation (gingivitis) with further development of periodontal diseases. a variety of oral bacteria such as streptococcus mutans and porhyromonas gingivalis are involved in pathogenesis of dental carries and periodontitis. very often bacterial infections are associated with candidiasis (candida albicans). chlorhexidine (chx) is the most commonly used antiseptic in dentistry due to its  strong antibacterial activity and capacity to reduce the accumulation of oral biofilms. however, other antiseptics, especially endodontic irrigants, are still  tested to improve their preventive and therapeutic effects in oral cavity infections. in this in vitro study we have compared antimicrobial activity of chx with that of taurine chloramine (tauc1) and taurine bromamine (taubr), natural taurine derivatives with known antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: antimicrobial activity of chx, tauc1 and taubr was tested by incubation  of the compounds with s. mutans, p gingivalis and c. albicans. the agents were incubated in low (105/ml) and high (108/ml) density microbe suspensions, related  to early and late biofilm infections, respectively. in some experiments bacteria  were incubated with a combination of chx + naocl and chx + taubr. mic was determined by the pour-plate method. results: chx showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against all tested pathogens. on the contrary, tauc1 was the weakest antiseptics used without effect on the growth of c. albicans. taubr at non-cytotoxic concentrations inhibited the growth of s. mutans and p gingivalis with slight effect on the low density c. albicans. all tested agents showed weaker antiseptic properties in the presence of serum. moreover, we have shown that interactions between chx and sodium hypochlorite (naoc1), the main endodontic irrigant, but not between chx and taubr,resulted in precipitation. therefore, it may restrict their simultaneous application in root canal treatment. however, in spite of this unwanted reaction, the mixture of chx with naocl kills pathogens more effectively then chx alone. conclusions: the results confirmed chx exceptional potential as primary antiseptic in dentistry, especially in prevention and treatment of dental carries, periodontal diseases and mouth candidiasis. moreover, our study shows that taubr may be used alternatively or in combination with chx in killing of oral pathogens, due to its strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == periodontal pathogens and respiratory diseases- evaluating their potential association: a clinical and microbiological study.
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether any potential association exists between respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and periodontal health status clinically and or microbiologically. materials and methods: fifty patients of copd (test group) and 50 patients without copd (control group) were recruited for the study with more than 20 years of age with  at least six natural teeth. all the patients were nonsmokers. periodontal health  was assessed by measuring clinical attachment loss (cal) and gingival bleeding by using william's graduated periodontal probe. microbiological evaluation was done  by collecting sputum samples of the subjects with respiratory diseases to find out any periodontal pathogen in the lung fluid. result and conclusion: the results showed that the subjects with copd had significantly more bleeding sites  (i.e. >20%) and had more of the clinical mean attachment loss (2.84 +/- 0.66) than those without copd. on the basis of the observed results of the study, we can hypothesize that the risk for copd appeared to be significantly elevated when attachment loss was found to be severe. clinical significance: it is conceivable  that oral interventions that improve oral health status may prove to lower the severity of lung infection in susceptible populations.

TI  == differences in bacterial saliva profile between periodontitis patients and a control cohort.
AB  == aim: periodontitis is a multifactorial disease in which subgingival bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. the objective of this study was to determine if periodontitis is associated with a characteristic salivary bacterial profile. this was accomplished by comparing the bacterial profile of saliva from subjects with chronic periodontitis with that of saliva from a control cohort. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 139 chronic periodontitis patients and 447 samples from a control cohort were analysed using  the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). frequency and levels (mean homim-value) of around 300 bacterial taxa/clusters in samples were used as  parameters for investigation. differences at taxon/cluster values between groups  were analysed using mann-whitney u-test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles obtained by the homim. results: eight bacterial taxa, including putative periodontal pathogens as parvimonas micra and filifactor alocis, and four bacterial clusters were identified statistically more frequently and at higher levels in samples from periodontitis patients than in samples from  the control cohort. these differences were independent of the individuals' smoking status. conclusions: periodontitis is associated with a characteristic bacterial profile of saliva different from that of a control cohort.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

AB  == to better understand the microbial basis of oral malodor development in humans, we used a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design and the pyrosequencing approach to track and compare the tongue microbiota associated with oral malodor  in 29 chinese adults who underwent a consecutive three-day evaluation for the amount of h2s excreted orally. three levels of the oral malodor state (healthy, oral malodor, and severe oral malodor) were defined based on the h2s level. community structure of the tongue plaques was more sensitive to changes of malodor state than to interpersonal variations or differences in sampling times.  within each individual, the structure of microbiota was relatively stable, while  their variations were correlated with the change in the h2s level. severe oral malodor microbiota were the most conserved in community structure, whereas the healthy ones were relatively varied. oral-malodor-associated bacteria were identified. the relative abundance of leptotrichia and prevotella was positively  correlated with oral malodor severity, whereas hemophilus and gemella exhibited a negative relationship with oral malodor severity. our study provides one of the first landscapes of oral microbiota changes associated with oral malodor development and reveals microbes potentially useful to the evaluation and control of oral malodor.

TI  == a tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  == current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. thus, caries is considered a diet- and ph-dependent process. we present here the  first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. the data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries  is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from  dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. although the relative proportion of streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. the functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and  dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel  caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. the results support a scenario in which ph and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. we propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.

TI  == effects of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and treatment efficacy.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and antimicrobial treatment efficacy. materials and methods: titanium disks with low-roughness pickled surfaces and with moderately rough sandblasted, acid-etched surfaces were used as substrata. streptococcus mutans biofilms (1 and 3 days old) and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms (3 days old) were grown on the two types of substrata and then treated with 0.2% chlorhexidine. biofilm viability was evaluated by a resazurin metabolism assay and by sonication-colony-forming unit counts. results: surface roughness had no influence on the amount of biofilm formation by s mutans or p gingivalis in this in vitro biofilm model. however, it strongly affected the treatment efficacy of chlorhexidine on the biofilms formed by both species. higher roughness resulted in lower efficacy. furthermore, treatment efficacy was  significantly reduced in older biofilms. conclusion: a moderately roughened surface did not enhance biofilm formation but reduced treatment efficacy of the biofilms. this finding indicates that efforts should be directed toward optimizing implant surface properties for effective antimicrobial treatment without compromising osseointegration.

TI  == dysbiosis of salivary microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease and its association with oral immunological biomarkers.
AB  == analysis of microbiota in various biological and environmental samples under a variety of conditions has recently become more practical due to remarkable advances in next-generation sequencing. changes leading to specific biological states including some of the more complex diseases can now be characterized with  relative ease. it is known that gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), mainly crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis,  exhibiting symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract. recent studies also showed increased frequency of oral manifestations among ibd patients, indicating aberrations in the oral microbiota. based on these observations, we analyzed the  composition of salivary microbiota of 35 ibd patients by 454 pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and compared it with that of 24 healthy controls (hcs). the results showed that bacteroidetes was significantly increased with a concurrent decrease in proteobacteria in the salivary microbiota of ibd patients. the dominant genera, streptococcus, prevotella, neisseria, haemophilus, veillonella, and gemella, were found to largely contribute to dysbiosis (dysbacteriosis) observed in the salivary microbiota of ibd patients. analysis of immunological biomarkers in the saliva of ibd patients showed elevated levels of  many inflammatory cytokines and immunoglobulin a, and a lower lysozyme level. a strong correlation was shown between lysozyme and il-1beta levels and the relative abundance of streptococcus, prevotella, haemophilus and veillonella. our data demonstrate that dysbiosis of salivary microbiota is associated with inflammatory responses in ibd patients, suggesting that it is possibly linked to  dysbiosis of their gut microbiota.

TI  == erythritol alters microstructure and metabolomic profiles of biofilm composed of  streptococcus gordonii and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the effects of sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol on periodontopathic biofilm are poorly understood, though they have often been reported to be non-cariogenic sweeteners. in the present study, we evaluated the  efficacy of sugar alcohols for inhibiting periodontopathic biofilm formation using a heterotypic biofilm model composed of an oral inhabitant streptococcus gordonii and a periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. confocal microscopic observations showed that the most effective reagent to reduce p. gingivalis accumulation onto an s. gordonii substratum was erythritol, as compared with xylitol and sorbitol. in addition, erythritol moderately suppressed s. gordonii monotypic biofilm formation. to examine the inhibitory effects of erythritol, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of erythritol-treated p. gingivalis and s. gordonii cells. metabolome analyses using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that a number of nucleic intermediates and constituents of the extracellular matrix, such as nucleotide sugars, were decreased by erythritol in a dose-dependent manner. next, comparative analyses of metabolites of erythritol- and sorbitol-treated cells were performed using both organisms to determine the erythritol-specific effects. in p. gingivalis, all detected dipeptides, including glu-glu, ser-glu, tyr-glu, ala-ala and thr-asp, were significantly decreased by erythritol, whereas they tended to be increased by sorbitol. meanwhile, sorbitol promoted trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation in s. gordonii cells. these results suggest that erythritol has inhibitory effects on dual species biofilm development via several pathways, including suppression of growth resulting from dna and rna depletion, attenuated extracellular matrix production, and alterations of dipeptide acquisition and amino acid metabolism.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == effect of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota over a 2-year monitoring period. i. overall effect and kinetics of change.
AB  == aim: to examine the 2-year post-therapy kinetics of change in the composition of  subgingival biofilms. material and methods: in this study, 178 chronic periodontitis subjects were recruited and clinically monitored at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after therapy. all subjects received scaling and root planing and 156 one or more of periodontal surgery, systemically administered amoxicillin + metronidazole or local tetracycline at pockets >/=5 mm. subgingival biofilm samples taken from each subject at each time point were analysed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the significance of changes in median species counts over time was sought using the wilcoxon or friedman tests and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean counts were significantly reduced from baseline to 2 years for 30 of the 40  taxa. marked reductions were observed for periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and eubacterium nodatum. the kinetics of change differed from species to species. when data were subset according to baseline pd, patterns of change in the microbial profiles were generally similar. conclusion: periodontal therapy leads to a rapid reduction in periodontal pathogens, followed by a slower reduction in other taxa that can be sustained for at least 2 years.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == microbial geography of the oral cavity.
AB  == we aimed to determine the bacterial diversity of different oral micro-niches and  to assess whether saliva and plaque samples are representative of oral microbial  composition. we took minute samples from each surface of the individual teeth and gingival crevices of two healthy volunteers (112 samples per donor), as well as samples from the tongue dorsum and non-stimulated and stimulated saliva. dna was  extracted from 67 selected samples of each donor, and the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr and pyrosequenced to obtain, on average, over 2,700 reads per sample, which were taxonomically assigned to obtain a geographic map of bacterial diversity at each tooth and sulcus location. analysis of the data shows considerable differences in bacterial composition between teeth at different intra-oral locations and between surfaces of the same tooth. the most pronounced  differences were observed in incisors and canines, where genera like streptococcus were found at 40% to 70% on the vestibular surfaces but were almost absent on the lingual sides. saliva samples, especially non-stimulated saliva, were not representative of supra-and subgingival plaque in the two individuals tested. we suggest that more precise sampling is required for the proper determination of oral microbial composition and to relate that diversity to epidemiological, clinical, and etiological parameters.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. the aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. methods: a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/ml), amoxicillin (15 mug/ml), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/ml), and azithromycin (10 mug/ml) over 24 hours. species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. results: metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by  doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. on the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of streptococcus anginosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). the strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific  reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == microcalorimetric determination of the effects of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and their combination on in vitro biofilm.
AB  == background: the mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. the aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). methods: titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068, fusobacterium nucleatum  atcc10953, and porphyromonas gingivalis dsm20709) were placed in a series of imc  ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for  10 days. lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. to validate the imc biofilm results,  adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and imc. results: in all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (p <0.05). maximum growth rate was significantly  lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with  controls (p <0.05). combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. a poor correlation was  observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. conclusions: imc  gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. the combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.

AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == intestinal microbiota of gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio) and its origin as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota has received increasing attention, as it influences growth, feed conversion, epithelial development, immunity as well as the intrusion of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestinal tract. in this study, pyrosequencing was used to explore the bacterial community of the intestine in gibel carp (carassius auratus gibelio), and the origin of these microorganisms. the results disclosed great bacterial diversities in the carp intestines and cultured environments. the gibel carp harbored characteristic intestinal microbiota, where proteobacteria were predominant, followed by firmicutes. the analysis on the 10 most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) revealed a majority of firmicutes in the intestinal content (by decreasing order: veilonella sp., lachnospiraceae, lactobacillales, streptococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp.). the second most abundant otu was rothia sp. (actinobacteria). the most likely potential probiotics (lactobacillus sp., and bacillus sp.) and opportunists (aeromonas sp., and acinetobacter sp.) were not much abundant. bacterial community comparisons showed that the intestinal community was closely  related to that of the sediment, indicating the importance of sediment as source  of gut bacteria in gibel carp. however, 37.95 % of the otus detected in feed were retrieved in the intestine, suggesting that food may influence markedly the microbiota of gibel carp, and therefore may be exploited for oral administration  of probiotics.

AB  == radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality used for patients with head-and-neck cancers, but inevitably causes microorganism-related oral complications. this study aims to explore the dynamic core microbiome of oral microbiota in supragingival plaque during the course of head-and-neck radiotherapy. eight subjects aged 26 to 70 were recruited. dental plaque samples  were collected (over seven sampling time points for each patient) before and during radiotherapy. the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes  were amplified, and the high-throughput pyrosequencing was performed. a total of  140 genera belonging to 13 phyla were found. four phyla (actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria) and 11 genera (streptococcus, actinomyces, veillonella, capnocytophaga, derxia, neisseria, rothia, prevotella,  granulicatella, luteococcus, and gemella) were found in all subjects, supporting  the concept of a core microbiome. temporal variation of these major cores in relative abundance were observed, as well as a negative correlation between the number of otus and radiation dose. moreover, an optimized conceptual framework was proposed for defining a dynamic core microbiome in extreme conditions such as radiotherapy. this study presents a theoretical foundation for exploring a core microbiome of communities from time series data, and may help predict community responses to perturbation as caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.

TI  == biological interaction between sasa senanensis rehder leaf extract and toothpaste ingredients.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity of alkaline extract of the leaves of sasa senanensis rehder (se). in order to manufacture an se-containing toothpaste for combating oral diseases, we investigated the possible interaction between the candidate ingredients of toothpaste: se, isopropyl methylphenol (ipmp, antibacterial agent) and charcoal prepared from sasa senanensis rehder. materials and methods: cell viability of mock-infected, hiv-infected and uv-irradiated cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. superoxide radical scavenging activity was determined by electron-spin resonance  spectroscopy. antibacterial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and streptococcus mutans atcc25175 was determined by the turbidity assay. results: exposure to less than 50% se or less than 0.31 mm ipmp for 10 min scarcely damaged human cultured gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. both se and ipmp showed bi-modal action, stimulating the bacterial growth at lower concentrations, but synergistically inhibiting it at higher concentrations. addition of extremely high concentrations of charcoal enhanced both anti-hiv and  anti-uv activity of se. conclusion: practically, addition of charcoal may not be  recommendable, since one or two orders higher concentrations of charcoal as compared with se, are required to achieve the synergistic effect for anti-hiv and anti-uv activity. rather, addition of about one tenth of the amount of ipmp may be recommendable for enhancing the antibacterial activity.

TI  == identification of organic acids in cichorium intybus inhibiting virulence-related properties of oral pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the low molecular mass (lmm) extract of cichorium intybus var. silvestre (red chicory) has been shown to inhibit virulence-linked properties of oral pathogens  including streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and prevotella intermedia. in the present study hplc-dad-esi/ms(2) was used to investigate the compounds contained in this extract for their anti-virulence activity. the extract contained a number of components, including oxalic, succinic, shikimic and quinic acids, which interfere with the growth and virulence traits (i.e., biofilm formation, adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite) of oral pathogens involved in gingivitis and tooth decay. succinic and quinic acid seem to be the most potent, mainly by interfering with the ability of oral pathogens to form biofilms (either through inhibition of their development or promotion of their disruption). our findings suggest that one or more of these compounds may modulate plaque formation in vivo, which is a prerequisite for the development of both caries and gingivitis.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == identification and characterization of porphyromonas gingivalis client proteins that bind to streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  == coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral streptococci is thought to play an important role in p. gingivalis colonization. previously, we reported that p. gingivalis major fimbriae interacted with streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and that amino acid residues 166 to 183 of gapdh exhibited strong binding activity toward p. gingivalis fimbriae (h. nagata, m. iwasaki, k. maeda, m. kuboniwa, e. hashino, m. toe, n. minamino, h. kuwahara, and s. shizukuishi, infect. immun. 77:5130-5138, 2009). the present study aimed to identify and characterize p. gingivalis components other than fimbriae that interact with s. oralis gapdh. a pulldown assay was performed to detect potential interactions between p. gingivalis client proteins  and s. oralis recombinant gapdh with amino acid residues 166 to 183 deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. seven proteins, namely, tonb-dependent receptor protein (raga4), arginine-specific proteinase b, 4-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme a dehydratase (abfd), lysine-specific proteinase, gapdh, nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and malate dehydrogenase (mdh), were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by proteomic analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. interactions between these client proteins and s. oralis gapdh were analyzed with a biomolecular interaction analysis system. s. oralis gapdh showed high affinity for five of the seven client proteins (raga4, abfd, gapdh, gdh, and mdh). interactions between p. gingivalis and s. oralis were measured by  a turbidimetric method and fluorescence microscopy. raga4, abfd, and gdh enhanced coaggregation, whereas gapdh and mdh inhibited coaggregation. furthermore, the expression of luxs in p. gingivalis was upregulated by raga4, abfd, and gdh but was downregulated by mdh. these results indicate that the five p. gingivalis client proteins function as regulators in p. gingivalis biofilm formation with oral streptococci.

TI  == microbial interactions in building of communities.
AB  == establishment of a community is considered to be essential for microbial growth and survival in the human oral cavity. biofilm communities have increased resilience to physical forces, antimicrobial agents and nutritional variations. specific cell-to-cell adherence processes, mediated by adhesin-receptor pairings  on respective microbial surfaces, are able to direct community development. these interactions co-localize species in mutually beneficial relationships, such as streptococci, veillonellae, porphyromonas gingivalis and candida albicans. in transition from the planktonic mode of growth to a biofilm community, microorganisms undergo major transcriptional and proteomic changes. these occur in response to sensing of diffusible signals, such as autoinducer molecules, and  to contact with host tissues or other microbial cells. underpinning many of these processes are intracellular phosphorylation events that regulate a large number of microbial interactions relevant to community formation and development.

TI  == arginine deiminase inhibits porphyromonas gingivalis surface attachment.
AB  == the oral cavity is host to a complex microbial community whose maintenance depends on an array of cell-to-cell interactions and communication networks, with little known regarding the nature of the signals or mechanisms by which they are  sensed and transmitted. determining the signals that control attachment, biofilm  development and outgrowth of oral pathogens is fundamental to understanding pathogenic biofilm development. we have previously identified a secreted arginine deiminase (adi) produced by streptococcus intermedius that inhibited biofilm development of the commensal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis through downregulation of genes encoding the major (fima) and minor (mfa1) fimbriae, both of which are required for proper biofilm development. here we report that this inhibitory effect is dependent on enzymic activity. we have successfully cloned,  expressed and defined the conditions to ensure that adi from s. intermedius is enzymically active. along with the cloning of the wild-type allele, we have created a catalytic mutant (adic399s), in which the resulting protein is not able to catalyse the hydrolysis of l-arginine to l-citrulline. p. gingivalis is insensitive to the adic399s catalytic mutant, demonstrating that enzymic activity is required for the effects of adi on biofilm formation. biofilm formation is absent under l-arginine-deplete conditions, and can be recovered by the addition  of the amino acid. taken together, the results indicate that arginine is an important signal that directs biofilm formation by this anaerobe. based on our findings, we postulate that adi functions to reduce arginine levels and, by a yet to be identified mechanism, signals p. gingivalis to alter biofilm development. adi release from the streptococcal cell and its cross-genera effects are important findings in understanding the nature of inter-bacterial signalling and  biofilm-mediated diseases of the oral cavity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

TI  == microbial colonization in orthodontic mini-implants.
AB  == peri-implant inflammation contributes for loss of secondary stability of orthodontic mini-implants. the investigation of microbial colonization in this area would benefit its control, and consequently favor the long-term success of mini-implants. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the establishment and the evolution of microbial colonization process in orthodontic  mini-implants for 3 months, since the time of their installation. one-hundred and fifty samples collected from 15 mini-implants were investigated from baseline up  to 3 months. the biological material was obtained from peri-implant area using paper points. nonspecific, streptococcus spp, lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were analyzed by cell growth methods. porphyromonas gingivalis colonization was observed by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction. data from cell growth were submitted to the wilcoxon sign rank test and results from molecular analysis were presented in a descriptive way. there was no significant  difference in the microbial colonization among the examined time intervals, except for streptococcus spp, between baseline and 24 h, which characterized the  initial colonization in this time interval. lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were insignificant. no porphyromonas gingivalis was detected among  the analyzed samples. the microbial colonization of mini-implants did not significantly change during the study. however, it should be monitored by orthodontists, since it is an important factor for mini-implants success.

TI  == bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to evaluate the bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes using of two 16s rrna gene libraries. each library was composed of samples from patients with different averages of the differentiated silness-loe biofilm index: the first library (a) with an index between 1.0 and 3.0 (considered a high index) and the second library (b) between 0 and 0.5 (considered a low index). saliva dna was extracted  and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and cloned. the obtained sequences were compared with those stored at ncbi and rdp genbank. the saliva of patients with high index presented five known genera - streptococcus, granulicatella, gemella,  veillonella and peptostreptococcus - and 33.3% of nonculturable bacteria grouped  into 23 operational taxonomic units (otus). the saliva of patients with low index differed significantly from the first library (p=0.000) and was composed of 42 otus distributed into 11 known genera - streptococcus, granulicatella, gemella, veillonella, oribacterium, haemophilus, escherichia, neisseria, prevotella, capnocytophaga, actinomyces - including 24.87% of nonculturable bacteria. it was  possible to conclude that there is greater bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with low dental plaque in relation to patients with high dental plaque.

TI  == treponema denticola improves adhesive capacities of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important etiological agent of periodontal disease,  is frequently found associated with treponema denticola, an anaerobic spirochete, in pathogenic biofilms. however, interactions between these two bacteria are not  well understood at the molecular level. in this study, we seek to link the influence of t. denticola on the expression of p. gingivalis proteases with its capacities to adhere and to form biofilms. the p. gingivalis genes encoding arg-gingipain a (rgpa), lys-gingipain (kgp), and hemagglutinin a (haga) were more strongly expressed after incubation with t. denticola compared with p. gingivalis alone. the amounts of the three resulting proteins, all of which contain hemagglutinin adhesion domains, were increased in culture supernatants. moreover, incubation of p. gingivalis with t. denticola promoted static and dynamic biofilm formation, primarily via a time-dependent enhancement of p. gingivalis adhesion capacities on bacterial partners such as streptococcus gordonii. adhesion of p. gingivalis to human cells was also increased. these results showed that interactions of p. gingivalis with other bacterial species, such as t. denticola, induce increased adhesive capacities on various substrata by hemagglutinin adhesion domain-containing proteins.

TI  == bacterial biofilm composition in caries and caries-free subjects.
AB  == background: certain major pathogens such as streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp. and others have been reported to be involved in caries initiation and progression. yet, in addition to those leading pathogens, microbial communities seem to be much more diverse and individually differing. the aim of this study, therefore, was to analyze the bacterial composition of carious dentin and the plaque of caries-free patients by using a custom-made, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (rq-pcr). methods: the study included 26 patients with caries and 28 caries-free controls. decayed tooth substance and plaque samples were harvested. bacterial dna was extracted and tested for the presence of 43 bacterial species or species groups using rq-pcr. results: relative quantification revealed that propionibacterium acidifaciens was significantly more abundant in caries samples than were other microorganisms (fold change 169.12, p = 0.023). in the caries-free samples, typical health-associated species were significantly more prevalent. unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis showed a high abundance of p. acidifaciens in caries subjects and distinct but individually differing bacterial clusters in the caries-free subjects. the distribution of 11 bacteria allowed full discrimination between caries and caries-free subjects. conclusion: within the investigated cohort, p. acidifaciens was the only pathogen significantly more abundant in caries subjects. cluster analysis yielded a diverse flora in caries-free subjects, whereas it was narrowed down to a small range of a few outcompeting members in caries subjects.

TI  == bacterial flora of dental periradicular lesions analyzed by the 454-pyrosequencing technology.
AB  == introduction: symptomatic teeth with periradicular lesions of infectious origin remain a significant challenge in dentistry, and the reason for the acute perturbation is incompletely understood. the present study used pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes to characterize the microbiota of periradicular lesions. methods: thirteen periradicular lesions from 11 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic teeth were sampled during apical surgery. samples  were subjected to dna extraction and 16s rrna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. pcr amplicons were then sequenced by using the roche 454 gs flx platform. data were analyzed with the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (qiime) software package. results: seven of the 13 periradicular lesions  (53.8%) yielded pcr amplicons, which generated 35,731 high-quality dna sequences  belonging to 10 bacterial phyla and 73 bacterial genera. all 7 lesions were associated with symptoms. the phyla with most bacterial taxa were proteobacteria  (proportion of total bacterial taxa, 33.3%), firmicutes (30.9%), actinobacteria (12.2%), and bacteroidetes (11.4%). the most abundant genera were fusobacterium (average of total sequences, 21.0%), streptococcus (8.0%), prevotella (7.5%), corynebacterium (7.2%), porphyromonas (6.0%). and actinomyces (5.8%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that the microbiota of symptomatic periapical lesions is predominated by anaerobic bacteria but also contains substantial levels of streptococci, actinomyces, and bacteria not previously identified in the oral cavity. the etiopathogenic role and therapeutic implication of periradicular bacteria need to be determined.

TI  == putative down-stream signaling molecule of gtpase in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a strict anaerobic bacterium mainly responsible for periodontal disease in oral cavity. putative gtpase gene (pgp) of this bacterium  was cloned and its recombinant protein (rpgp) was produced in escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of sgp that is a gtp-binding protein of streptococcus mutans, putative gtpase amino acid sequence was deduced in the data base of genome sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis. a 900-bp pcr fragment was amplified with p. gingivalis genomic dna as a template and cloned into e. coli jm 109. then pgp was transferred into pqe-30 expression vector to make pqe-pgp for production of rpgr. this protein was produced and purified by ni-nta affinity column chromatography. anti-pgp antibody was also produced in sprague dawley rats. using westernblot analysis with this antibody, it was confirmed that the rpgp produced in e. coli was identical to that of donor strain. furthermore, by southernblot analysis it was revealed that the pgp was originated from p. gingivalis. by immunoprecipitation with anti-pgp antibody and n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis it was found that pgp was able to bind to acetate kinase,  which was reported to be a secondary signaling-molecule in anaerobic microorganisms. therefore, these results imply that p. gingivalis produces putative gtpase and this protein might play a potential role in signaling pathway in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == proteomics of streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  == background: streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. it is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. we have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of p. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of s. gordonii, p. gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. here we report the adaptation of s. gordonii to the same model. results: 1122 s. gordonii proteins were detected in s. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with f. nucleatum, 849 with p. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis individually or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum together. the changes were species specific, though the p. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with p. gingivalis or both p. gingivalis and  f. nucleatum. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed pts (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. these results were seen across  all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. f. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. p. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. the communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. conclusion: this study showed that s. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.

TI  == isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. to assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees c by imc. the microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (s. sanguinis  41.3 +/- 4.8%, f. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and p. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). imc  revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by  microscopy. peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muw), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muw), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 j) showed very high variation. these imc results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. the present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.

AB  == background: the university of nevada, las vegas school of dental medicine recently opened an orthodontic treatment clinic to address the needs of the racially and ethnically diverse population of southern nevada, primarily focusing on the treatment and care of low-income and minority patients. although orthodontic treatment and therapy has been shown to induce changes in the oral cavity, much of this evidence was collected from traditional white, teenage orthodontic clinic populations. the primary goal of this study was to describe the microbial burden of the cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis within the unlv-sdm patient population. methods: representative saliva samples were collected from healthy adult patients for dna isolation. relative endpoint polymerase chain reaction (re-pcr) was performed to ascertain the presence and relative microbial burden of these oral pathogens. results: nearly one quarter (13/56) or 23.3% of these patients had elevated levels of s. mutans, while (10/56) and 17.8% of these samples were found to have elevated levels of p. gingivalis, - with (90%) of p. gingivalis-positive  samples from minority patients (x2=17.921, d.f. = 1; p<0.0001). conclusions: these findings of elevated p. gingivalis levels, primarily among minority patients, may suggest underlying oral health practices contributing to adverse oral health conditions within this population. oral health knowledge and practices among minority patients may be strongly influenced by other factors, including education and socioeconomic status, suggesting additional research may  be needed to accurately determine the most appropriate standards for care and oral health education within this patient population.

TI  == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == antimicrobial responses of primary gingival cells to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background: human beta-defensins (hbds) and the c-c chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20) produced by gingival epithelial cells (gecs) and fibroblasts (hgfs) are antimicrobial peptides (amps) that play an important role in innate immunity. the aim of this study was to determine the differential immune response of gecs and hgfs to the oral commensal streptococcus gordonii (sg) and the pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis (pg). material and methods: in addition to the analysis  of gingival biopsies, primary gecs and hgfs were exposed to sg and/or pg, and expression of various amps and pro-inflammatory mediators was studied by real-time pcr and elisa. results: gene expression of amps was detected in gingival connective tissue. both sg and pg induced the mrna-expression of hbd-2 and hbd-3 in gecs as well as hgfs after 24 h (p < 0.05). in hgfs, the commensal bacterium sg stimulated the mrnas of hbd-3 and ccl20 after 24 h (p < 0.05), while not in gecs. in gecs, the inductive effect of pg on the mrna-expression of hbd-2  was amplified when cells were first exposed to commensal sg (for 1 h) prior to stimulation with pg (sg-pg; p < 0.05). conclusion: our data indicate that cell-bacteria interactions and/or bacteria-bacteria cross-talk may have an impact on amp-regulation in gingiva.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of geranyloxy- and farnesyloxy-acetophenone  derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the compounds 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-geranyloxyacetophenone (1) and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-farnesyloxy-acetophenone (2) are oxyprenylated secondary metabolites extracted from plants belonging to the rutaceae family. in this study, 1 and 2 were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity toward major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by selective prenylation of 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone at the 4' position with geranyl and farnesyl bromide, respectively. compound 1 showed stronger antimicrobial activity than 2 against major oral pathogens, including gram positive bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus), gram negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis) and candida albicans. evidences were obtained that the mode of action of 1 and 2 may be related to their iron-chelating property. this study suggests that 1 and 2 may represent potential natural molecules for the prevention/treatment of common oral infections, including dental caries, periodontal disease, and candidiasis.

TI  == ascending necrotizing fasciitis of the face following odontogenic infection.
AB  == necrotizing fasciitis (nf) of the face is a rare but extremely dangerous complication of dental infection associated with a nearly 30% mortality rate. this infection spreads rapidly along the superficial fascial planes of the head and neck and can lead to severe disfigurement. reports in the literature of cases of nf of the face caused by dental infection are few. we report such a case in a  36-year-old woman and review the current standards of diagnosis and management. the patient initially presented with pain and severe swelling in the left side of her face subsequent to a dental infection. the symptoms had progressed quickly and had not improved with administration of oral antibiotics in the outpatient setting. the patient had no palpable crepitus despite its classic association with nf. the infection also took a rare, ascending route of spread with involvement of the temporalis muscle. cultures taken during debridement grew streptococcus anginosus and bacteroides. biopsies of involved muscle showed histologic evidence of necrosis. through early surgical intervention including aggressive debridement, and the adjunctive use of appropriate antibiotics, the patient recovered with minimal loss of facial mass and no skin loss. although nf  of the face is rare, the surgeon must maintain a high index of suspicion with any patient presenting after a dental infection with rapid progression of swelling and a disproportionate amount of pain that is unresponsive to antibiotics.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (emwi) on oral bacterial pathogens. methods and results: a gram-negative (porphyromonas gingivalis) or gram-positive (streptococcus mutans,  s. intermedius, enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by emw apparatus (500-1000 khz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). quantification of survival bacteria by cfu counting revealed that emwi exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 khz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. after emwi at 500 khz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of s. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (s.  mutans and p. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. emwi inhibited the inductive effect of s. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, emwi partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from p. gingivalis. conclusions: these findings demonstrated that emwi has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. significance and impact of the study: electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus arca interferes with porphyromonas gingivalis pathogenicity in mice.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as one of  the major pathogens in chronic periodontitis, an infectious disease affecting the majority of the adult population. we have previously demonstrated that a surface  protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of streptococcus cristatus represses production of p. gingivalis long fimbriae and interrupts the formation of p. gingivalis biofilms in vitro. our in vivo studies have also shown that the distribution of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in human subgingival plaque is negatively correlated. the objective of this study was to determine if s. cristatus arca inhibits p. gingivalis colonization and attenuates its subsequent  pathogenesis in alveolar bone loss in the murine oral cavity. material and methods: a wild-type strain of s. cristatus (cc5a) and its arca knockout mutant (arcae) were used as initial colonizers in the oral cavity of balb/cbyj mice. colonization of p. gingivalis on the existing s. cristatus biofilms was assessed  by quantitative pcr, and p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was measured 6  wk after p. gingivalis infection. results: the presence of s. cristatus cc5a, but not its arca mutant, attenuated p. gingivalis colonization in the murine oral cavity. in addition, p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was significantly lower in mice initially infected with s. cristatus cc5a than in those infected with the arca mutant. conclusion: this study provides direct evidence that s. cristatus arca has an inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis colonization, which may  in turn attenuate the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis.

AB  == protein phosphorylation on tyrosine has emerged as a key device in the control of numerous cellular functions in bacteria. in this article, we review the structure and function of bacterial tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. phosphorylation is catalyzed by autophosphorylating adenosine triphosphate-dependent enzymes (bacterial tyrosine (by) kinases) that are characterized by the presence of walker motifs. the reverse reaction is catalyzed by three classes of enzymes: the eukaryotic-like phosphatases (ptps) and dual-specific phosphatases; the low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatases (lmw-ptps); and the polymerase-histidinol phosphatases (php). many by kinases and tyrosine phosphatases can utilize host cell proteins as substrates, thereby contributing to bacterial pathogenicity. bacterial tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation  is also involved in biofilm formation and community development. the porphyromonas gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase ltp1 is involved in a restraint pathway that regulates heterotypic community development with streptococcus gordonii. ltp1 is upregulated by contact with s. gordonii and ltp1 activity controls adhesin expression and levels of the interspecies signal ai-2.

TI  == connective tissue graft plus resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for the treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions: microbiological and immunological results.
AB  == objectives: it was previously reported the clinical results of placing subgingival resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of this treatment on the subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) inflammatory markers. materials and methods: thirty-four patients presenting the combined defect were selected. the defects were treated with either connective tissue graft plus modified glass ionomer restoration (ctg+r) or with connective tissue graft only (ctg). evaluation included bleeding on probing and probing depth, 5 different bacteria targets in the subgingival plaque assessed at baseline, 45, and 180 days post treatments, and 9 inflammatory mediators were also assessed in the gcf. results: the levels of each target bacterium were similar during the entire period of evaluation (p > 0.05), both within and between groups. the highest levels among the studied species were observed for the bacterium associated with periodontal health. additionally, the levels of all cyto/chemokines analyzed were not statistically different between groups (p > 0.05). conclusion: within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the presence of subgingival restoration may not interfere with the subgingival microflora and with gcf inflammatory markers analyzed. clinical relevance: this approach usually leads to the placement of a subgingival restoration. there is a lack of information about the microbiological and immunological effects of this procedure. the results suggest that this combined approach may be considered as a treatment option for the lesion included in this study.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == role of gallium and silver from phosphate-based glasses on in vitro dual species  oral biofilm models of porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == phosphate-based glasses (pbgs) are excellent controlled delivery agents for antibacterial ions such as silver and gallium. the aim of this study was to assess the potential utility of novel pbgs combining both gallium and silver for  use in periodontal therapy. to this end, an in vitro biofilm model with the putative periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis, and an initial colonizer, streptococcus gordonii, was established. the effect of increasing calcium content in gallium-silver-doped pbg on the susceptibility of p. gingivalis was examined. a decrease in degradation rates (30.34, 25.19, 21.40 mug mm(-2) h(-1)) with increasing pbg calciumcontent (10, 11, 12 mol.% respectively)  was observed, correlating well with gallium and silver ion release and antimicrobial activity against planktonic p. gingivalis (approximately 5.4log(10) colony-forming units (cfu) reduction after 24h by the c10 glass compared with controls) and s. gordonii (total growth inhibition after 32h by c10, c11 and c12  glasses compared with controls). the most potent pbg (c10) was evaluated for its  ability to inhibit the biofilm growth of p. gingivalis in a newly established constant-depth film fermentor model. the simultaneous release of silver and gallium from the glass reduced p. gingivalis biofilm growth with a maximum effect (1.92log(10) cfu reduction) after 168 h. given the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and dearth of new antibiotics in development, the glasses, especially c10, would offer effective alternatives to antibiotics or may complement current therapies through controlled, localized delivery of gallium and silver ions at infected sites in the oral cavity.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  == background: honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. the aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. methods: the study was conducted in two parts. in the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512  mug/ml were tested in duplicate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. the in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. the kruskal-wallis test was used for significance, and the mann-whitney u test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. the mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. results: the honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. the chlorhexidine gluconate  rinse had the lowest mics compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. the in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. conclusion: honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == surface properties of titanium and zirconia dental implant materials and their effect on bacterial adhesion.
AB  == objectives: zirconia ceramic material has been widely used in implant dentistry.  in this in vitro study the physiochemical properties of titanium and zirconia materials were investigated and the affinity of different bacteria to different materials was compared. methods: disc samples with different surface states were  used: polished partially stabilized zirconia (pz), titanium blasted with zirconia (tbz), titanium blasted with zirconia then acid etched (tbza), and polished titanium (pt) as a control. surface topography was examined using scanning electron microscopy and profilometry. contact angle, surface free energy (sfe), surface microhardness and chemical composition were determined. disc samples were separately incubated with streptococcus mitis and prevotella nigrescens, either with or without pre-coating with human saliva, for 6h and the surface area covered by bacteria was calculated from fluorescence microscope images. results:  pz and tbz exhibited lower surface free energy and lesser surface wettability than pt. also, pz and tbz surfaces showed lower percentage of bacterial adhesion  compared with control pt surface. conclusions: the zirconia material and titanium blasted with zirconia surface (tbz surface) showed superior effect to titanium material in reducing the adhesion of the experimented bacteria especially after coating with saliva pellicle. modifying titanium with zirconia lead to have the same surface properties of pure zirconia material in reducing bacterial adhesion. sfe appears to be the most important factors that determine initial bacterial adhesion to smooth surface.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

AB  == objectives: modifications of titanium (ti) implant surfaces have a significant effect on early biofilm formation and the outcome of implant procedures. the aim  of this study was to examine the role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces in the adhesion mechanism of oral bacteria to modified ti surfaces. materials and methods: ti discs with three different types of surface modifications, machined,  acid-etched, and acid-etched and blasted, were examined for adhesion of oral bacteria: streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. following pretreatment of the ti with ion rich solutions or coating by human serum albumin or fibronectin, bacterial adhesion was examined by scanning electron microscopy and assessed quantitatively by dna analysis. ti coating by proteins as well as bacterial adhesion and their interrelationships were further  investigated through confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: acid-etched and blasted ti surfaces exhibited significantly higher amounts of bacteria adhesion than the other two surfaces. calcium was found to serve as a bridging agent in the adhesion process of s. mutans and f. nucleatum to ti surfaces. although albumin coating of the ti reduced the adhesion of s. mutans to all surfaces, it had no influence on the adhesion of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. coating the ti with fibronectin enhanced p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adhesion. conclusions: bacterial adhesion to ti surfaces is roughness-dependent, and the adhesion mechanism is influenced by ions and proteins of the initial coating derived from  the blood.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

AB  == objectives: to explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. background: numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. however, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various  oral care methods for five consecutive days. materials and methods: the subjects  consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. after the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) tooth brushing 2) tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. results: consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an  improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and  oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). conclusions: it was suggested that the use of not  only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.

TI  == tobacco smoke augments porphyromonas gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilm formation.
AB  == smoking is responsible for the majority of periodontitis cases in the us and smokers are more susceptible than non-smokers to infection by the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. p. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity  is dependent upon its interaction with other plaque bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii. microarray analysis suggested that exposure of p. gingivalis to cigarette smoke extract (cse) increased the expression of the major fimbrial antigen (fima), but not the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa1). therefore, we hypothesized that cse promotes p. gingivalis-s. gordonii biofilm formation in a fima-dependent manner. fima total protein and cell surface expression were increased upon exposure to cse whereas mfa1 was unaffected. cse exposure did not  induce p. gingivalis auto-aggregation but did promote dual species biofilm formation, monitored by microcolony numbers and depth (both, p<0.05). interestingly, p. gingivalis biofilms grown in the presence of cse exhibited a lower pro-inflammatory capacity (tnf-alpha, il-6) than control biofilms (both, p<0.01). cse-exposed p. gingivalis bound more strongly to immobilized rgapdh, the cognate fima ligand on s. gordonii, than control biofilms (p<0.001) and did so in a dose-dependent manner. nevertheless, a peptide representing the mfa1 binding site on s. gordonii, sspb, completely inhibited dual species biofilm formation. thus, cse likely augments p. gingivalis biofilm formation by increasing fima avidity which, in turn, supports initial interspecies interactions and promotes subsequent high affinity mfa1-sspb interactions driving biofilm growth. cse induction of p. gingivalis biofilms of limited pro-inflammatory potential may explain the increased persistence of this pathogen in smokers. these findings may also be relevant to other biofilm-induced infectious diseases and conditions.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesives used were corega ultra((r)), fixodent pro original((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip. for streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mutans, four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. in addition four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml without  any denture adhesive was employed as control. for prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml without  adhesive served as control. all samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c.  after 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/ml. the results were evaluated with anova on ranked data and tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. however, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. corega ultra((r))  and biotene((r)) denture grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than fixodent pro original((r)).

TI  == isoflavonoids and coumarins from glycyrrhiza uralensis: antibacterial activity against oral pathogens and conversion of isoflavans into isoflavan-quinones during purification.
AB  == phytochemical investigation of a supercritical fluid extract of glycyrrhiza uralensis has led to the isolation of 20 known isoflavonoids and coumarins, and glycycarpan (7), a new pterocarpan. the presence of two isoflavan-quinones, licoriquinone a (8) and licoriquinone b (9), in a fraction subjected to gel filtration on sephadex lh-20 is due to suspected metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of licoricidin (1) and licorisoflavan a (2). the major compounds in the extract, as well as 8, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of several major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 showed the most potent antibacterial activities, causing a marked growth inhibition of the cariogenic species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus at 10 mug/ml and the periodontopathogenic species porphyromonas gingivalis (at 5 mug/ml) and prevotella intermedia (at 5 mug/ml for 1 and 2.5 mug/ml for 2). only 1 moderately inhibited growth of fusobacterium nucleatum at the highest concentration tested (10 mug/ml).

TI  == differential expression and adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotypes.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a primary pathogen involved in the initiation and progression of adult chronic periodontitis. its colonization on oral surfaces is  a necessary first step leading to infection. fima, a subunit protein of major (long) fimbriae, is a well-known virulence factor. based on its nucleotide sequence, fima is classified into several genotypes. we compared here the transcriptional levels of the fima gene in several p. gingivalis strains using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, fimbrial display on the p. gingivalis surface using transmission electronic microscopy, and the adherence competencies of p. gingivalis strains carrying different types of fimas towards saliva and streptococcus gordonii surfaces using mutagenesis analysis. we demonstrated differential expression of each fima gene in these p. gingivalis strains. a correlation of the transcription level of fima and binding activity of p. gingivalis was revealed. we show that p. gingivalis strains with genotype i and ii of fima are efficient in interaction with saliva or s. gordonii. this work highlights the important role of fima type i and ii in p. gingivalis attachment to oral surfaces.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == oral biofilm analysis of palatal expanders by fluorescence in-situ hybridization  and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
AB  == confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) of natural heterogeneous biofilm is today facilitated by a comprehensive range of staining techniques, one of them being fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). we performed a pilot study in which oral biofilm samples collected from fixed orthodontic appliances (palatal expanders) were stained by fish, the objective being to assess the three-dimensional organization of natural biofilm and plaque accumulation. fish creates an opportunity to stain cells in their native biofilm environment by the  use of fluorescently labeled 16s rrna-targeting probes. compared to alternative techniques like immunofluorescent labeling, this is an inexpensive, precise and straightforward labeling technique to investigate different bacterial groups in mixed biofilm consortia. general probes were used that bind to eubacteria (eub338 + eub338ii + eub338iii; hereafter eubmix), firmicutes (lgc354 a-c; hereafter lgcmix), and bacteroidetes (bac303). in addition, specific probes binding to streptococcus mutans (mut590) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pogi) were used. the  extreme hardness of the surface materials involved (stainless steel and acrylic resin) compelled us to find new ways of preparing the biofilm. as these surface materials could not be readily cut with a cryotome, various sampling methods were explored to obtain intact oral biofilm. the most workable of these approaches is  presented in this communication. small flakes of the biofilm-carrying acrylic resin were scraped off with a sterile scalpel, taking care not to damage the biofilm structure. forceps were used to collect biofilm from the steel surfaces.  once collected, the samples were fixed and placed directly on polysine coated glass slides. fish was performed directly on these slides with the probes mentioned above. various fish protocols were combined and modified to create a new protocol that was easy to handle. subsequently the samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. well-known configurations could be visualized, including mushroom-style formations and clusters of coccoid bacteria  pervaded by channels. in addition, the bacterial composition of these typical biofilm structures were analyzed and 2d and 3d images created.

TI  == presence of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == periodontal disease has been recently linked to a variety of systemic conditions  such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, preterm delivery, and oral cancer. the  most common bacteria associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) has not yet been studied in the malignant gingival tissues. the objective of this study was to investigate the presence of p. gingivalis in specimens from squamous cell carcinoma patients. we have performed  immunohistochemical staining to investigate the presence of p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii), a non invasive oral bacteria, in paraffin embedded samples of gingival squamous cell carcinoma (n = 10) and normal gingiva  (n = 5). staining for p. gingivalis revealed the presence of the bacteria in normal gingival tissues and gingival carcinoma, with higher levels (more than 33%, p < 0.05) detected in the carcinoma samples. the staining intensity was also significantly enhanced in the malignant tissue by 2 folds (p < 0.023) compared to specimens stained for the non-invasive s. gordonii. p. gingivalis is abundantly present in malignant oral epithelium suggesting a potential association of the bacteria with gingival squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == influence of gaseous ozone in peri-implantitis: bactericidal efficacy and cellular response. an in vitro study using titanium and zirconia.
AB  == dental implants are prone to bacterial colonization which may result in bone destruction and implant loss. treatments of peri-implant disease aim to reduce bacterial adherence while leaving the implant surface intact for attachment of bone-regenerating host cells. the aims of this study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of gaseous ozone on bacteria adhered to various titanium and zirconia surfaces and to evaluate adhesion of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells to  ozone-treated surfaces. saliva-coated titanium (sla and polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) disks served as substrates for the adherence of streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277. the test specimens were treated with gaseous ozone (140 ppm; 33 ml/s) for 6 and 24 s. bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonication, serially diluted and cultured. mg-63 cell adhesion was analyzed with reference to cell attachment, morphology, spreading, and proliferation. surface topography as well as cell morphology of the test specimens were inspected by sem. the highest bacterial adherence was found on titanium sla whereas the other surfaces revealed 50-75% less adherent bacteria. p. gingivalis was eliminated by ozone from all surfaces within 24 s to  below the detection limit (>/=99.94% reduction). s. sanguinis was more resistant  and showed the highest reduction on zirconia substrates (>90% reduction). ozone treatment did not affect the surface structures of the test specimens and did not influence osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation negatively. titanium (polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) had a lower colonization potential and may be suitable material for implant abutments. gaseous ozone showed selective efficacy to reduce adherent bacteria on titanium and zirconia without affecting adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells. this in vitro study may provide a solid basis for clinical studies on gaseous ozone treatment of peri-implantitis and revealed an essential base for sufficient tissue regeneration.

TI  == oral microbiome profiles: 16s rrna pyrosequencing and microarray assay comparison.
AB  == objectives: the human oral microbiome is potentially related to diverse health conditions and high-throughput technology provides the possibility of surveying microbial community structure at high resolution. we compared two oral microbiome survey methods: broad-based microbiome identification by 16s rrna gene sequencing and targeted characterization of microbes by custom dna microarray. methods: oral wash samples were collected from 20 individuals at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center. 16s rrna gene survey was performed by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3-v5 region (450 bp). targeted identification by dna microarray was carried out  with the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). correlations and relative abundance were compared at phylum and genus level, between 16s rrna sequence read ratio and homim hybridization intensity. results: the major phyla,  firmicutes, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, and fusobacteria were  identified with high correlation by the two methods (r = 0.70 approximately 0.86). 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing identified 77 genera and homim identified 49, with 37 genera detected by both methods; more than 98% of classified bacteria were assigned in these 37 genera. concordance by the two assays (presence/absence) and correlations were high for common genera (streptococcus, veillonella, leptotrichia, prevotella, and haemophilus; correlation = 0.70-0.84). conclusion: microbiome community profiles assessed by 16s rrna pyrosequencing and homim were highly correlated at the phylum level and, when comparing the more commonly detected taxa, also at the genus level. both methods are currently suitable for high-throughput epidemiologic investigations relating identified and more common oral microbial taxa to disease risk; yet, pyrosequencing may provide  a broader spectrum of taxa identification, a distinct sequence-read record, and greater detection sensitivity.

TI  == live/dead real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess new therapies against dental plaque-related pathologies.
AB  == dna-based methodology for the identification and detection of specific bacteria in dental plaque offers advantages over culturing techniques. one drawback of current molecular techniques like real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) is that they are not able to distinguish between live or dead  bacteria. to overcome this problem an assay was assessed to discriminate between  viable or dead bacteria using dna intercalating substances, propidium monoazide (pma) and ethidium monoazide (ema) in combination with rt-qpcr. the assay was tested on oral pathogens: streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. to determine the effectiveness of ema and  pma, different concentrations (from 5 to 100 mug ml(-1)) of the substances were added to viable or heat-killed suspensions of both organisms (ranging from 10(8)  to 10(4) colony-forming units ml(-1)). afterwards, pma was tested on mixtures of  varying ratios of viable and dead cells. after dna extraction, rt-qpcr was performed using species-specific primers. both compounds inhibited pcr amplification from dead cells. the ema treatment resulted in the largest signal decrease but ema also inhibited dna amplification from viable cells. for this reason, pma was selected for use in further experiments. it was shown to be efficient in allowing selective pcr detection of only viable cells in mixtures containing both viable and dead cells. the amount of amplified dna corresponded to the percentage of viable cells in the sample. the developed assay will potentially be useful for assessing bacterial loads remaining after disinfection  protocols without interference by non-viable bacteria.

TI  == b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors of oral squamous carcinoma cells are upregulated by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the up-regulation of the b7-h1 receptors in host cells might influence the chronicity of inflammatory disorders that frequently precede the development of human cancers. b7-h1 expression has been detected in the majority of human cancers, leading to anergy and apoptosis of activated t cells, and enabling tumor cells to overcome host response. porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), a putative periodontal pathogen, is an etiologic agent of periodontitis and expresses a variety of virulence factors. in this study, the expression of b7-h1  and b7-dc receptors on squamous cell carcinoma cells scc-25 and bhy and primary human gingival keratinocytes (phgk) was analyzed after infection with two virulent p. gingivalis strains in vitro. after 48h, the cells were stained with antibodies for human b7-h1 and b7-dc and further analyzed by flow cytometry. rna  was extracted and gene expression of b7-h1 or b7-dc was quantified by real time pcr. after infection with p. gingivalis, both b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors were up-regulated. the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) increased from 4.5 to 9.9 (b7-h1) and from 6.9 to 15.0 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively) in scc-25 cells. phgk showed an increase from 4.8 to 12.4 (b7-h1) and from 5.5 to 15.6 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively). streptococcus salivarius k12, a commensal bacterium, caused no up-regulation. after 24h, the expression of b7h1 and b7-dc mrna in infected cells, normalized to gapdh and in relation to non-infected cells, was 6.4 fold (b7-h1) and 8.6 fold (b7-dc) higher. in phgk b7-h1/dc mrna expression increased 8.2 fold (b7-h1) and 5.9 fold (b7dc) (p<0.05) respectively. the results of the study demonstrate that in contrast to s. salivarius k12 virulent p. gingivalis strains are able to induce the expression of the b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors in squamous carcinoma cells and human gingival keratinocytes, which might facilitate immune evasion by oral cancers.

TI  == the pathogenic persona of community-associated oral streptococci.
AB  == the mitis group streptococci (mgs) are widespread in the oral cavity and are traditionally associated with oral health. however, these organisms have many attributes that contribute to the development of pathogenic oral communities. mgs adhere rapidly to saliva-coated tooth surfaces, thereby providing an attachment substratum for more overtly pathogenic organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis, and the two species assemble into heterotypic communities. close physical association facilitates physiologic support, and pathogens such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans display resource partitioning to favour carbon sources generated by streptococcal metabolism. mgs exchange information with community members through a number of interspecies signalling systems including ai-2 and contact dependent mechanisms. signal transduction systems induced in p. gingivalis are based on protein dephosphorylation mediated by the tyrosine phosphatase ltp1, and converge on a luxr-family transcriptional regulator, cdhr. phenotypic responses in p. gingivalis include regulation of hemin uptake systems and gingipain activity, processes that are intimately linked to the virulence of the organism. furthermore, communities of s. gordonii with p. gingivalis or with a. actinomycetemcomitans are more pathogenic in animal models  than the constituent species alone. we propose that mgs should be considered accessory pathogens, organisms whose pathogenic potential only becomes evident in the context of a heterotypic microbial community.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

AB  == primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium  displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum or streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas s. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. none of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance.  p. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. however, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and s. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6 and il-8 secretion; and f. nucleatum stimulated production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, but not p. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. the results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. in addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.

AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most prevalent acquired infection of patients on intensive care units and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. evidence suggests that an improved understanding of the  composition of the biofilm communities that form on endotracheal tubes may result in the development of improved preventative strategies for ventilator-associated  pneumonia. methodology/principal findings: the aim of this study was to characterise microbial biofilms on the inner luminal surface of extubated endotracheal tubes from icu patients using pcr and molecular profiling. twenty-four endotracheal tubes were obtained from twenty mechanically ventilated  patients. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiling of 16s rrna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population, together with species specific pcr of key marker oral microorganisms and a quantitative assessment of culturable aerobic bacteria. analysis of culturable aerobic bacteria revealed a range of colonisation from no growth to 2.1x10(8) colony forming units (cfu)/cm(2) of endotracheal tube (mean 1.4x10(7) cfu/cm(2)). pcr targeting of specific bacterial species detected the oral bacteria streptococcus mutans (n = 5) and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 5). dgge profiling of the endotracheal biofilms revealed complex banding patterns containing between 3 and 22 (mean 6) bands per tube, thus demonstrating the marked complexity of the constituent biofilms. significant inter-patient diversity was evident. the number of dgge bands detected was not related to total viable microbial counts or the duration of intubation. conclusions/significance: molecular profiling using dgge  demonstrated considerable biofilm compositional complexity and inter-patient diversity and provides a rapid method for the further study of biofilm composition in longitudinal and interventional studies. the presence of oral microorganisms in endotracheal tube biofilms suggests that these may be important in biofilm development and may provide a therapeutic target for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == microbial diversity of peri-implant biofilms on implant fixed bar and telescopic  double crown attachments.
AB  == one of the principal problems in oral implantation is inflammation of peri-implant hard and soft tissues caused by bacterial biofilms. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbial diversity of peri-implant biofilms on 2 different implant-anchored attachment types in vivo. samples of peri-implant sulcus fluid were collected from 8 patients with implant-supported bar attachments and 8 patients with implant-anchored telescopic double crown attachments. samples of sulcus fluid of the adjacent teeth were also collected from the partially edentulous patients with implant fixed telescopic double crowns. the mixed amplicons of 16s rrna fragments of different bacterial origins  were separated by use of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to identify the predominant bacterial genera. with 3.5 +/- 2.1 different predominant bacterial genera in the sulcus fluid surrounding implant-supported bar attachments and 6.3 +/- 3.1 different predominant genera in the sulcular fluid of implant-anchored double crown attachments, the differences were not statistically significant (p = .11). the microbial diversity in the sulcus fluid surrounding the remaining dentition was similar to that of the implant fixed telescopic attachments (6.3 +/- 2.1). aside from host response and other individual factors, the microbial diversity of peri-implant biofilms seems to be impaired by cofactors such as the possibility of cleaning the implant-supported supraconstructions and the different plaque-retaining sites. nevertheless, these  differences do not lead to statistically significant differences in the microbial diversity of peri-implant plaques.

TI  == in vivo antimicrobial effects of endodontic treatment procedures as assessed by molecular microbiologic techniques.
AB  == introduction: this culture-independent molecular microbiology study evaluated the antimicrobial effects of chemomechanical preparation supplemented by intracanal medication during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: samples  were taken from 24 necrotic root canals at the baseline (s1), after chemomechanical preparation by using 2.5% naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after a 7-day interappointment medication with calcium hydroxide paste in either glycerin (chg) or camphorated paramonochlorophenol/glycerin (chpg) (s3). bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were positive for bacteria but negative for both archaea and fungi. treatment procedures were highly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. overall, 46% of s2 samples and 62.5% of s3 samples were pcr-negative for bacteria. specifically, s2 and s3 samples yielded negative pcr results in 50% and 58% of the canals in the chg group and in 42% and 67% of the canals in the chpg group, respectively. except for comparisons with s1 samples, no other statistically significant differences were observed for intragroup and intergroup comparisons involving s2 and s3. several taxa were still found in s2 and s3 samples, and the most prevalent were propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus species. conclusions: bacterial levels and number of taxa were substantially reduced after chemomechanical preparation and intracanal medication. however, presence of detectable levels of persisting bacteria in many cases indicates that the search for more effective antimicrobial treatment strategies should be stimulated.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  == background and objectives: since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. the study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide eugenol, vitapex and metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly  from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. method: microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. the microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using agar diffusion technique. results: were statistically analyzed using one-way anova. facultative/aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. zoe showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by vitapex, calcium hydroxide and metapex in descending order. conclusion: our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. in vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of  any of the test filling material.

TI  == community signalling between streptococcus gordonii and porphyromonas gingivalis  is controlled by the transcriptional regulator cdhr.
AB  == interspecies signalling between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii serves to constrain development of dual species communities. contact with s. gordonii propagates a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signal within p. gingivalis that culminates in reduced transcription of adhesin and signalling genes. here we demonstrate the involvement of the p. gingivalis orphan luxr family transcription factor pgn_1373, which we designate cdhr, in this control pathway. expression of cdhr is elevated following contact with s. gordonii; however, regulation of cdhr did not occur in a mutant lacking the tyrosine phosphatase ltp1, indicating that cdhr and ltp1 are components of the same regulon. contact between s. gordonii and a cdhr mutant resulted in increased transcription of mfa, encoding the subunit of the short fimbriae, along with higher levels of mfa protein. expression of luxs, encoding ai-2 synthase, was also increased in the cdhr mutant after contact with s. gordonii. the mfa adhesive function and ai-2-dependent signalling participate in the formation and  development of dual species communities, and consistent with this the cdhr mutant displayed elevated accumulation on a substratum of s. gordonii. recombinant cdhr  protein bound to upstream regulatory regions of both mfa and luxs, indicating that cdhr has a direct effect on gene expression. luxs was also found to participate in a positive feedback loop that suppresses cdhr expression. interaction of mfa fimbriae with s. gordonii is necessary to initiate signalling  through cdhr. these results reveal cdhr to be an effector molecule in a negative  regulatory network that controls p. gingivalis-s. gordonii heterotypic communities.

TI  == periodontal pathogens interfere with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence properties in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background and objective: the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens dominate at disease sites is not yet understood. one possibility is that these late colonizers antagonize the quorum-sensing systems of early colonizers and render those early colonizers less resistant to environmental factors. in this study, we utilized streptococcus mutans, a well-documented oral streptococcus with many quorum-sensing-dependent properties, as an example of an earlier colonizer antagonized by periodontal pathogens. material and methods: in this study, s. mutans ng8 and s. mutans lt11 were used in experiments assessing transformation,  and s. mutans bm71 was used in experiments investigating bacteriocin production.  the effects of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on these competence-stimulating peptide-dependent properties were evaluated in mixed-broth assays. results: both p. gingivalis (either live bacteria or membrane vesicles) and t. denticola antagonized transformation in s.  mutans ng8 and lt11. the production of bacteriocin by s. mutans bm71 was also inhibited by p. gingivalis and t. denticola. boiling of these late colonizers before addition to the broth cultures abolished their ability to inhibit s. mutans transformation and bacteriocin production. p. gingivalis and t. denticola  inactivated s. mutans exogenous competence-stimulating peptide, whereas the boiled bacteria did not. conclusions: this study demonstrated that periodontal pathogens antagonize s. mutans quorum-sensing properties. this may render s. mutans less virulent and less resistant to environmental antibacterial factors.

TI  == structural dissection and in vivo effectiveness of a peptide inhibitor of porphyromonas gingivalis adherence to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa) with streptococcal antigen i/ii (e.g., sspb) facilitates colonization of the dental biofilm by porphyromonas gingivalis. we previously showed that a 27-mer peptide derived from sspb (designated bar) resembles the nuclear receptor (nr) box protein-protein interacting domain and potently inhibits this interaction in vitro. here, we show that the exxp motif upstream of the nr core alpha-helix contributes to the mfa-sspb interaction and that bar reduces p. gingivalis colonization and alveolar bone loss in vivo in a murine model of periodontitis. substitution of gln for pro(1171) or glu(1168) increased the alpha-helicity of bar and reduced its inhibitory activity in vitro by 10-fold and 2-fold, respectively. to determine if bar prevents p. gingivalis infection in vivo, mice were first infected with streptococcus gordonii and then challenged with p. gingivalis in the absence and  presence of bar. animals that were infected with either 10(9) cfu of s. gordonii  dl-1 or 10(7) cfu of p. gingivalis 33277 did not show a statistically significant increase in alveolar bone resorption over sham-infected controls. however, infection with 10(9) cfu of s. gordonii followed by 10(7) cfu of p. gingivalis induced significantly greater bone loss (p < 0.01) than sham infection or infection of mice with either organism alone. s. gordonii-infected mice that were subsequently challenged with 10(7) cfu of p. gingivalis in the presence of bar exhibited levels of bone resorption similar to those of sham-infected animals. together, these results indicate that both exxp and the nr box are important for  the mfa-sspb interaction and that bar peptide represents a potential therapeutic  that may limit colonization of the oral cavity by p. gingivalis.

TI  == cdkn2bas is associated with periodontitis in different european populations and is activated by bacterial infection.
AB  == epidemiological studies have indicated a relationship between coronary heart disease (chd) and periodontitis. recently, cdkn2bas was reported as a shared genetic risk factor of chd and aggressive periodontitis (agp), but the causative  variant has remained unknown. to identify and validate risk variants in different european populations, we first explored 150 kb of the genetic region of cdkn2bas  including the adjacent genes cdkn2a and cdkn2b, covering 51 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagsnps) in agp and chronic periodontitis (cp) in individuals of dutch origin (n=313). in a second step, we tested the significant  snp associations in an independent agp and cp population of german origin (n=1264). for the tagsnps rs1360590, rs3217992, and rs518394, we could validate the associations with agp before and after adjustment for the covariates smoking, gender and diabetes, with snp rs3217992 being the most significant (or 1.48, 95%  ci 1.19 to 1.85; p=0.0004). we further showed in vivo gene expression of cdkn2bas, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, and cdk4 in healthy and inflamed gingival epithelium (ge) and connective tissue (ct), and detected a significantly higher expression of cdkn2bas in healthy ct compared to ge (p=0.004). after 24 h of stimulation with porphyromonas gingivalis in streptococcus gordonii pre-treated gingival fibroblast (hgf) and cultured gingival epithelial cells (gecs), we observed a 25-fold and fourfold increase of cdkn2bas gene expression in hgfs (p=0.003) and gecs (p=0.004), respectively. considering the global importance of cdkn2bas in the disease risk of chd, this observation supports the theory of inflammatory components in the disease physiology of chd.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == the bacterial microbiota in the oral mucosa of rural amerindians.
AB  == the oral microbiota plays an important role in buccal health and in diseases such as periodontitis and meningitis. the study of the human oral bacteria has so far  focused on subjects from western societies, while little is known about subjects  from isolated communities. this work determined the composition of the oral mucosa microbiota from six amazon amerindians, and tested a sample preservation alternative to freezing. paired oral swabs were taken from six adults of guahibo  ethnicity living in the community of platanillal, amazonas state, venezuela. replicate swabs were preserved in liquid nitrogen and in aware messenger fluid (calypte). buccal dna was extracted, and the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified and pyrosequenced. a total of 17 214 oral bacterial sequences were obtained from the six subjects; these were binned into 1034 otus from 10 phyla, 30 families and 51 genera. the oral mucosa was highly dominated by four phyla: firmicutes (mostly the genera streptococcus and veillonella), proteobacteria (mostly neisseria), bacterioidetes (prevotella) and actinobacteria (micrococcineae). although the microbiota were similar at the phylum level, the amerindians shared only 62 % of the families and 23 % of the genera with non-amerindians from previous studies, and had a lower richness of genera (51 vs  177 reported in non-amerindians). the amerindians carried unidentified members of the phyla bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria and their microbiota included soil bacteria gp1 (acidobacteriaceae) and xylanibacter (prevotellaceae), and the rare genus phocoenobacter (pasteurellaceae). preserving buccal swabs in the aware messenger oral fluid collection device substantially altered the bacterial composition in comparison to freezing, and therefore this method cannot be used to preserve samples for the study of microbial communities.

AB  == background: moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against most putative periodontal pathogens and has been shown to kill bacteria in biofilm and host cells. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive a single subgingival application of a 0.125%, 0.4%, or 1.25% moxifloxacin gel or placebo gel immediately after full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp). clinical efficacy measurements were assessed in sites with baseline probing depth (pd) of >/=5.4 mm at 6 weeks and 3 months and any adverse  events were determined. in addition, putative periodontal pathogens and resistance of subgingival bacteria against moxifloxacin were assessed. results: data of 57 patients were included in the statistical analysis. in all treatment groups, the pd decreased from baseline to 3 months, with the greatest reduction seen in patients treated with moxifloxacin 0.4% (1.5 +/- 0.6 mm; p = 0.023 compared to placebo), followed by patients receiving moxifloxacin 1.25% (1.2 +/-  0.4), moxifloxacin 0.125% (1.1 +/- 1.1), and placebo (1.0 +/- 0.6). no linear trend for pd reduction with increasing moxifloxacin concentrations was found. porphyromonas gingivalis showed the greatest reduction in prevalence among the assessed pathogens, without any significant intergroup differences. no correlation or systematic relationship between adverse events, including bacterial resistance against moxifloxacin, and the investigational gels was found. conclusions: in periodontal pockets with pd of >/=5.4 mm, a single subgingival administration of a 0.4% moxifloxacin gel as an adjunct to srp may result in additional pd reduction compared to srp alone. in addition, the investigated moxifloxacin gels seem to be safe.

TI  == detection of selected bacterial species in intraoral sites of patients with chronic periodontitis using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to detect the prevalence of selected bacterial species in intraoral sites of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp)  using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methodology: samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, supragingival and subgingival plaque and saliva of 30 patients with untreated cp. multiplex pcr was used to determine prevalence rates, which were then compared using a chi-square test. significance level was set at p<0.05. mean and standard deviation values were used to evaluate variations in prevalence according to site. results: the prevalence of s. mutans was 70% in saliva; 60% in samples collected from the tongue dorsum; 50% in samples collected from the buccal mucosa; 56.5% in the supragingival plaque; and 53.5% in the subgingival plaque. the prevalence of e. faecalis ranged from 3.5% to 13.5% in all intraoral microenvironment. the highest prevalence of p. gingivalis was found in subgingival plaque (53.5%), and of p. intermedia in supragingival plaque (33.5%), subgingival plaque (30%) and tongue dorsum (33.5%). the prevalence of bacteria did not vary significantly among the intraoral sites. conclusions: all studied bacteria were identified in intraoral sites. s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia had high prevalence rates, but  the prevalence of e. faecalis was low. multiplex pcr proved to be an adequate method for epidemiological studies.

TI  == selective substitution of amino acids limits proteolytic cleavage and improves the bioactivity of an anti-biofilm peptide that targets the periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the interaction of the periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis, with oral  streptococci such as streptococcus gordonii precedes colonization of the subgingival pocket and represents a target for limiting p. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity. previous studies showed that a synthetic peptide (designated bar) derived from the antigen i/ii protein of s. gordonii was a potent competitive inhibitor of p. gingivalis adherence to s. gordonii and subsequent biofilm formation. here we show that despite its inhibitory activity,  bar is rapidly degraded by intact p. gingivalis cells in vitro. however, in the presence of soluble mfa protein, the p. gingivalis receptor for bar, the peptide  is protected from proteolytic degradation suggesting that the affinity of bar for mfa is higher than for p. gingivalis proteases. the rate of bar degradation was reduced when the p. gingivalis lysine-specific gingipain was inhibited using the  specific protease inhibitor, z-fkck, or when the gene encoding the lys-gingipain  was inactivated. in addition, substituting d-lys for l-lys residues in bar prevented degradation of the peptide when incubated with the lys-gingipain and increased its specific adherence inhibitory activity in a s. gordonii-p. gingivalis dual species biofilm model. these results suggest that lys-gingipain accounts in large part for p. gingivalis-mediated degradation of bar and that more effective peptide inhibitors of p. gingivalis adherence to streptococci can  be produced by introducing modifications that limit the susceptibility of bar to  the lys-gingipain and other p. gingivalis associated proteases.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == oral bacterial genome sequencing using the high-throughput roche genome sequencer flx system.
AB  == for over 30 years, the chain termination method of dna sequencing (commonly known as sanger sequencing) has been the mainstay of any dna sequencing project. in the past, whole-genome sequencing employing exclusively sanger chemistry has been a labor-intensive and costly exercise and an option unfeasible for the average research group. however, within the last 4 years, the introduction of three high-throughput sequencing technologies (454, solid, and illumina) has revolutionized genomics by facilitating unprecedented levels (up to gigabasepairs) of reliable dna sequence output in a relatively short time frame and at a much lower cost per sequenced basepair. here, we provide laboratory and  bioinformatic protocols that will allow the average research group to undertake high-throughput sequencing of oral bacterial genomes using the roche genome sequencer flx system which employs 454 pyrosequencing technology.

TI  == a streptococcal effector protein that inhibits porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm development.
AB  == dental plaque formation is a developmental process involving cooperation and competition within a diverse microbial community, approximately 70 % of which is  composed of an array of streptococci during the early stages of supragingival plaque formation. in this study, 79 cell-free culture supernatants from a variety of oral streptococci were screened to identify extracellular compounds that inhibit biofilm formation by the oral anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381. the majority of the streptococcal supernatants (61 isolates) resulted in lysis of p. gingivalis cells, and some (17 isolates) had no effect on cell viability, growth or biofilm formation. one strain, however, produced a supernatant that abolished biofilm formation without affecting growth rate. analysis of this activity led to the discovery that a 48&emsp14;kda protein was responsible for the inhibition. protein sequence identification and enzyme activity assays identified the effector protein as an arginine deiminase. to identify the mechanism(s) by which this protein inhibits biofilm formation, we began by examining the expression levels of genes encoding fimbrial subunits; surface structures known to be involved in biofilm development. quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed that exposure of p. gingivalis cells to this protein for 1&emsp14;h resulted in the downregulation of genes encoding proteins that are the major subunits of two distinct types of thin, single-stranded fimbriae (fima and  mfa1). furthermore, this downregulation occurred in the absence of arginine deiminase enzymic activity. hence, our data indicate that p. gingivalis can sense this extracellular protein, produced by an oral streptococcus (streptococcus intermedius), and respond by downregulating expression of cell-surface appendages required for attachment and biofilm development.

TI  == role of arginine deiminase of streptococcus cristatus in porphyromonas gingivalis colonization.
AB  == the ability to attach to a variety of oral surfaces is an important characteristic of porphyromonas gingivalis. previous studies have demonstrated that expression and production of fima, a major subunit protein of the long fimbriae, is required for p. gingivalis colonization. here we report that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca) of streptococcus cristatus, represses  fima production and inhibits biofilm formation of p. gingivalis. this inhibitory  function of arca is also observed in the formation of heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilms. p. gingivalis is released from streptococcal substrates in the presence of arca, likely due to an inhibition of  fima production. this work suggests that arca may have the potential to be a specific antibiofilm agent to fight p. gingivalis infections.

AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. study design: twenty patients with genuine  halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. results: all 20 patients were positive for l. salivarius dna in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. the scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. conclusions: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.

AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == oral microflora in patients on hemodialysis and kidney transplant recipients.
AB  == introduction: we aimed to determine oral microflora of patients on long-term hemodialysis and kidney transplant recipients, and to compare them with individuals without kidney disease. materials and methods: we studied on 3 groups including patients on at least 6 months of hemodialysis, kidney transplant recipients for more than 2 years, and controls with a normal kidney function. staining and culture were applied for samples from the dorsum of the tongue and the oral floor in order to detect aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and candida. results: the participants were 49 patients on hemodialysis, 50 kidney transplant  recipients, and 50 volunteers in the control group. the abundance of candida was  significantly higher in the hemodialysis and transplant groups compared with the  control group. the mean of various microorganisms was found to be significantly higher in the hemodialysis group than the control group (p = .03); however, the frequency of these microorganisms in the transplant group was lower than that in  the hemodialysis group. adjusting for confounding factors, the odds of having candida in the hemodialysis and transplant groups were 3.54 (95% ci, 1.21 to 10.41) and 3.49 (95% ci, 1.27 to 9.18) times higher compared to the control group, respectively. conclusions: hemodialysis and kidney transplantation could affect oral microflora. candida was significantly more frequent in these patients compared to healthy adults. streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, porphyromonas, and candida is seen slightly less frequently after kidney transplantation, which  might be in favor of promising effects of kidney transplantation on oral microflora.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == roles of oral bacteria in cardiovascular diseases--from molecular mechanisms to clinical cases: porphyromonas gingivalis is the important role of intimal hyperplasia in the aorta.
AB  == it has been reported that dna of oral bacterial species, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans, was detected frequently in specimens of arteriosclerotic vessels. however, the source of dna, whether from live intact bacteria or a part of the bacteria, has not been identified yet. moreover, there  was no precise evidence concerning involvement of oral bacteria in the progression of arteriosclerosis. we tried to clarify the involvement of p. gingivalis on the mechanisms of development of aortic intimal hyperplasia. intravenous administration of p. gingivalis dramatically induced intimal hyperplasia in the mouse model with photochemical impairment of the femoral artery. however there were no changes identified in the mice without aortic impairment, even with the p. gingivalis infection. concomitantly, s100 calcium-binding protein a9 (s100a9) and the embryonic isoform of myosin heavy chain (smemb), a proliferative phenotypic marker of smooth muscle cells, were significantly overexpressed on the surfaces of smooth muscle cells present in the injured blood vessels. similarly, increased expressions of s100a9 and smemb proteins were observed in aneurismal specimens obtained from p. gingivalis-infected patients. we found that bacteremia induced by p. gingivalis leads to intimal hyperplasia associated with overexpressions of s100a9 and smemb. our results strongly suggest that oral-hematogenous spreading of p. gingivalis is a causative event in the development of aortic hyperplasia in periodontitis patients.

TI  == a microbiological study in relation to the presence of caries and calculus.
AB  == objective: to examine whether oral microflora in individuals with caries differs  from that of individuals with calculus in thai adolescents with poor oral hygiene. material and methods: one hundred 13-year-old schoolchildren from southern thailand were examined for the presence of caries, calculus and plaque and saliva ph was also determined. saliva samples were analysed by culture and approximal supragingival plaque samples were analysed with the dna-dna hybridization method ('checkerboard'). results: among the 100 children, mean dmfs was 3.43 [standard deviation (sd) 2.82] and 90% had calculus. the correlation between dmfs and the calculus index was 0.064. a total of 36 children were caries-free and 56 had calculus including teeth other than those in the lower anterior region (calculus score > or =3). a total of 23 caries-free children with a high calculus score (> or =3) were compared with 22 children with the highest dmfs [mean 11.19 (sd 5.58)] and a calculus score < 3. no significant difference was obtained for saliva and plaque ph. the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were low. significantly more children in the caries group had high levels of glycolytic prevotella nigrescens and filifactor alocis in plaque compared with the calculus group. calculus cases had a significantly higher total viable count in saliva. conclusions: there was no inverse correlation between the presence of caries and calculus at a population level and a high calculus score only marginally reduced the individual likelihood of having caries. several glycolytic bacteria were related to caries, while no specific bacteria could be related to calculus formation. calculus seemed to be more closely related to poor oral hygiene.

TI  == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == interplay of protease-activated receptors and nod pattern recognition receptors in epithelial innate immune responses to bacteria.
AB  == protease-activated receptors (pars), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) receptors and toll-like receptors (tlrs) play a role in innate immunity, but little is known about interaction between these receptors. the goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) were transfected with sirna specific for par1 or par2, then stimulated with periopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen streptococcus gordonii. par1 or par2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated nod1 and nod2 expression with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum stimulation (p<0.01), as well as enhanced tlr2 and tlr4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize tlr2 or tlr4, respectively. involvement  of pars for induction of cc chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. furthermore, results from multiple cytokine elisa array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters.

TI  == development of a novel pcr method to comprehensively analyze salivary bacterial flora and its application to patients with odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to develop a novel polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method to comprehensively analyze salivary bacterial flora. study  design: the bacterial flora in the saliva of 10 healthy persons and 11 patients with odontogenic infections were examined using a dna extraction method with a high level of cell destruction efficiency and a novel universal primer set to amplify approximately 580 bp of the 16s rdna sequence. results: streptococcus (54.5%), neisseria (14.7%), actinomyces (8.4%), gemella (4.1%), granulicatella (3.8%), and prevotella (1.4%) were dominant in a total of 1655 clones examined from the saliva of the healthy subjects. the dominant genera differed among the patients with odontogenic infections (a total of 823 clones) and were entirely different from those of the healthy subjects. conclusion: this novel comprehensive salivary bacterial flora analysis method may be a useful supportive method to identify causative agents of odontogenic infections.

TI  == periodontitis, periodontopathic bacteria and lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is a component of saliva and is suspected to be a defense factor against oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. periodontitis is a very common oral disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria.  antimicrobial activities and other biological effects of lf against representative periodontopathic bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, have been widely studied. association of polymorphisms in lf with incidence of aggressive periodontitis and the role of lf in the gingival crevicular fluid as a marker of periodontitis severity have also been reported. periodontopathic bacteria reside as a biofilm in supragingival and subgingival plaque. our recent study indicated that lf exhibits antibacterial activity against planktonic forms of p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia at higher concentrations, and furthermore, lf effectively inhibits biofilm formation and reduces the established biofilm of these bacteria at physiological concentrations. a small-scale clinical study indicated that oral administration of bovine lf reduces p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients. lf seems to be a biofilm inhibitor of periodontopathic bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == oral bacterial extracts facilitate early osteogenic/dentinogenic differentiation  in human dental pulp-derived cells.
AB  == objectives: bacterial metabolites demineralize dental hard tissues, and soluble factors lead to tertiary dentinogenesis in the area of the dentin-pulp complex. however, it is unclear whether the oral bacteria are directly involved in the differentiation of dental pulp cells. in this study, we evaluated the effect of oral bacterial extracts on cellular differentiation in human dental pulp-derived  cells (hdpc). study design: the hdpc were obtained from third molar teeth, and the cells were subcultured. the sonicated extracts were obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis (gram-negative) and streptococcus mutans (gram-positive). the effect of bacterial extracts on cellular growth and differentiation in hdpc were tested. results: alkaline phosphatase activity and bone sialoprotein (bsp) gene expression were increased in hdpc exposed to low concentrations of both sonicated extracts, whereas the activity was decreased upon exposure to high concentrations of sonicated extracts from p. gingivalis. conclusion: this is the first evidence that oral bacteria have a positive effect  on cellular differentiation in hpdc.

TI  == epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  == aim: the dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different  levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. the aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 secretion induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. materials and methods: hgecs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis produced high levels of il-1beta, while challenge with live a. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of  il-8. the opportunistic pathogen f. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal s. gordonii is the least stimulatory. conclusion: we conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria  induce different cytokine response profiles in primary hgecs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.

TI  == bactericidal effects of different laser systems on bacteria adhered to dental implant surfaces: an in vitro study comparing zirconia with titanium.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to examine in vitro the anti-bacterial  efficacy of two different laser systems (co(2) and diode) applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis cells in suspensions or adhered to zirconia or titanium dental implant materials, with two different surfaces each. materials and methods: bacteria were irradiated at two different power settings with either a co(2) (lambda=10,600 nm) or a diode laser (lambda=810 nm). the lower mode is used clinically (for co(2) 100 j/cm(2), diode  50 j/cm(2)) and the higher may alter the materials' surface (for co(2) 1200 j/cm(2), diode 150 j/cm(2)). after irradiation, the number of viable bacteria was determined by culture. results: planktonic cells of both species were more resistant to the laser irradiations than bacteria that adhered to surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed at both wavelengths lambda=10,600 and 810 nm even at the lower settings, independent of the material. s. sanguinis  cells that adhered to either zirconia surface were effectively killed by the co(2) laser at the lower setting of 100 j/cm(2). however, the higher settings of  both lasers were needed to reduce s. sanguinis that adhered to titanium surfaces. the co(2) laser at the lower setting and the diode laser at the higher setting effectively reduced the viability of s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis that adhered to zirconia surfaces. conclusions: under irradiation conditions known not to alter zirconia implant surfaces in vitro, both co(2) laser (100 j/cm(2)) and the  diode laser (150 j/cm(2)) effectively reduced the viability of adhered s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis.

TI  == identification of bacteria enduring endodontic treatment procedures by a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse-capture checkerboard  approach.
AB  == introduction: this study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16s ribosomal rna-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. methods: samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after chemomechanical preparation with naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3). bacterial presence was first screened by a dna-based single pcr assay. rna extracts were subjected to rt-pcr, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. results: bacteria were found in all s1 samples. detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal rna, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. the most prevalent taxa in s1 were olsenella uli (67%), pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), streptococcus species (53%), and bacteroidetes clone x083 (53%). streptococcus species (47%), fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and o. uli (33%) prevailed in s2, whereas streptococcus species (47%), propionibacterium acnes (27%), and o. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in s3. conclusions: the present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.

TI  == defining the healthy "core microbiome" of oral microbial communities.
AB  == background: most studies examining the commensal human oral microbiome are focused on disease or are limited in methodology. in order to diagnose and treat  diseases at an early and reversible stage an in-depth definition of health is indispensible. the aim of this study therefore was to define the healthy oral microbiome using recent advances in sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing). results: we sampled and sequenced microbiomes from several intraoral niches (dental surfaces, cheek, hard palate, tongue and saliva) in three healthy individuals. within an individual oral cavity, we found over 3600 unique sequences, over 500 different otus or "species-level" phylotypes (sequences that  clustered at 3% genetic difference) and 88 - 104 higher taxa (genus or more inclusive taxon). the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes (genus streptococcus, family veillonellaceae, genus granulicatella), proteobacteria (genus neisseria, haemophilus), actinobacteria (genus corynebacterium, rothia, actinomyces), bacteroidetes (genus prevotella, capnocytophaga, porphyromonas) and fusobacteria (genus fusobacterium).each individual sample harboured on average 266 "species-level" phylotypes (sd 67; range 123 - 326) with cheek samples being  the least diverse and the dental samples from approximal surfaces showing the highest diversity. principal component analysis discriminated the profiles of the samples originating from shedding surfaces (mucosa of tongue, cheek and palate) from the samples that were obtained from solid surfaces (teeth).there was a large overlap in the higher taxa, "species-level" phylotypes and unique sequences among the three microbiomes: 84% of the higher taxa, 75% of the otus and 65% of the unique sequences were present in at least two of the three microbiomes. the three individuals shared 1660 of 6315 unique sequences. these 1660 sequences (the "core microbiome") contributed 66% of the reads. the overlapping otus contributed to 94% of the reads, while nearly all reads (99.8%) belonged to the shared higher taxa. conclusions: we obtained the first insight into the diversity and uniqueness of individual oral microbiomes at a resolution of next-generation sequencing. we showed that a major proportion of bacterial sequences of unrelated healthy individuals is identical, supporting the concept of a core microbiome at  health.

TI  == molecular analysis of aortic intimal hyperplasia caused by porphyromonas gingivalis infection in mice with endothelial damage.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis infection is thought to be a significant etiological factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases. however, scant definitive evidence has been presented concerning the pathological molecular mechanisms of these disorders. in the present study, we performed a molecular analysis of the developmental mechanisms of aortic intimal hyperplasia  induced by p. gingivalis. material and methods: the effects of p. gingivalis-induced bacteremia on intimal hyperplasia were evaluated using a mouse model of aortic hyperplasia created by photochemical-induced endothelial cell injury. alterations of gene expression profiles in injured blood vessels of the mice were extensively analyzed using dna microarray assays to identify the key molecules involved in p. gingivalis-induced hyperplasia. in addition, human aneurismal specimens from patients with or without p. gingivalis infection were analyzed histochemically. results: intravenous administration of p. gingivalis dramatically induced intimal hyperplasia in the mouse model. concomitantly, s100  calcium-binding protein a9 (s100a9) and embryonic isoform of myosin heavy chain (smemb), a proliferative phenotypic marker of smooth muscle cells, were significantly overexpressed on the surfaces of smooth muscle cells present in the injured blood vessels. similarly, increased expressions of s100a9 and smemb proteins were observed in aneurismal specimens obtained from p. gingivalis-infected patients. conclusion: we found that bacteremia induced by p.  gingivalis leads to intimal hyperplasia associated with overexpressions of s100a9 and smemb. our results strongly suggest that oral-hematogenous spreading of p. gingivalis is a causative event in the development of aortic hyperplasia in periodontitis patients.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == oral microbiota of children in a school-based dental clinic.
AB  == objectives: dental caries disproportionately affects disadvantaged subjects. this study hypothesized that there were greater caries extent and higher levels of caries-associated and anaerobic subgingival bacterial species in oral samples of  hispanic and immigrant children compared with non-hispanic and us born children.  methods: children from a school-based dental clinic serving a community with a large hispanic component were examined, and the extent of caries was recorded. microbial samples were taken from teeth and the tongues of children. samples were analyzed using dna probes to 18 oral bacterial species. results: seventy five children were examined. extent of caries increased with child age in immigrant, but not in us born or hispanic children. there were no differences in the microbiota based on ethnicity or whether the child was born in us or not. there was a higher species detection frequency from teeth than tongue samples. levels of streptococcus mutans and other streptococcus spp increased with caries extent. prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and selenomonas spp were detected at  low levels in these children. conclusions: we conclude that, while there was a high rate of dental caries in disadvantaged school children, there were no differences in the caries-associated microbiota, including s. mutans, based on ethnicity or immigration status. furthermore, while anaerobic subgingival, periodontal pathogens were also detected in children, there was no difference in  species detection based on ethnicity or immigration status. increased levels of streptococci, including s. mutans, however, were detected with high caries levels. this suggested that while it is beneficial to target preventive and treatment programs to disadvantaged populations, there is likely no additional benefit to focus on subgroups within a population already at high risk for dental disease.

TI  == negative correlation of distributions of streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major causative agents of adult periodontitis. one of the features of this periodontal pathogen is its ability to attach to a variety of oral bacterial surfaces and to colonize subgingival dental plaque. we have shown that streptococcus cristatus cc5a inhibits expression of fima, a gene encoding the major protein subunit of long fimbriae in p. gingivalis; as a result, s. cristatus interrupts formation of p. gingivalis biofilms. here we further demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of s. cristatus affects multiple strains of p. gingivalis and that optimal inhibitory activity correlates with levels of arginine deiminase expression in s. cristatus. more strikingly, the impact of s. cristatus on p. gingivalis colonization was revealed by comparing levels of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in subgingival dental plaque. spearman correlation analysis indicated a negative correlation between the distributions of s. cristatus and p. gingivalis (r = -0.57; p < 0.05). these data suggest that some early colonizers of dental plaque, such as s. cristatus, may be beneficial to the host by antagonizing the colonization and accumulation of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == role of the cysteine protease interpain a of prevotella intermedia in breakdown and release of haem from haemoglobin.
AB  == the gram-negative oral anaerobe prevotella intermedia forms an iron(iii) protoporphyrin ix pigment from haemoglobin. the bacterium expresses a 90 kda cysteine protease, inpa (interpain a), a homologue of streptococcus pyogenes streptopain (speb). the role of inpa in haemoglobin breakdown and haem release was investigated. at ph 7.5, inpa mediated oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin to hydroxymethaemoglobin [in which the haem iron is oxidized to the fe(iii) state and which carries oh- as the sixth co-ordinate ligand] by limited proteolysis of  globin chains as indicated by sds/page and maldi (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization)-tof (time-of-flight) analysis. prolonged incubation  at ph 7.5 did not result in further haemoglobin protein breakdown, but in the formation of a haemoglobin haemichrome (where the haem fe atom is co-ordinated by another amino acid ligand in addition to the proximal histidine residue) resistant to degradation by inpa. inpa-mediated haem release from hydroxymethaemoglobin-agarose was minimal compared with trypsin at ph 7.5. at ph  6.0, inpa increased oxidation at a rate greater than auto-oxidation, producing aquomethaemoglobin (with water as sixth co-ordinate ligand), and resulted in its  complete breakdown and haem loss. aquomethaemoglobin proteolysis and haem release was prevented by blocking haem dissociation by ligation with azide, whereas inpa  proteolysis of haem-free globin was rapid, even at ph 7.5. both oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin and breakdown of methaemoglobin by inpa were inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor e-64 [trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane]. in summary, we conclude  that inpa may play a central role in haem acquisition by mediating oxyhaemoglobin oxidation, and by degrading aquomethaemoglobin in which haem-globin affinity is weakened under acidic conditions.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of select  microorganisms in oral biofilms and to investigate relationships between oral and respiratory status in persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disabilities (idd). study design: we conducted a 6-month-long observational cohort study with 63 persons with idd. oral examinations, oral sampling, and medical record reviews were performed at baseline and then monthly. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to analyze all baseline oral samples for the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), prevotella melaninogenica, and candida albicans. pcr analyses were also performed on participants' samples collected in the month before being diagnosed with a respiratory infection. results: all subjects had p. melaninogenica detected by pcr in their oral samples. fifty-five percent (35 of 63) of participants had s. pneumoniae, mrsa, and c. albicans in their oral samples at baseline. no dental decay was detected clinically, oral hygiene was fair, and dysphagia was common. during the 6 months of the study, there were 22 respiratory infections (35% of participants)-12 pneumonias, 7 sinusitis, 1 bronchitis, and 1 upper respiratory tract infection. participants with microorganisms in their baseline samples were significantly more likely to develop any respiratory infection and those who had poor oral status were significantly more likely to develop pneumonia. almost 60% of participants who developed respiratory infections had the same microorganism detected in the sample collected in the month before infection as had been detected in their baseline sample. conclusion: potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity and poor oral status significantly increased the risk of developing respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in persons with idd. the results suggest that colonization with these microorganisms may persist despite routine tooth brushing. meticulous comprehensive oral hygiene of the oral cavity may be needed to reduce oropharyngeal microbial load.

TI  == identification of the binding domain of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis forms communities with antecedent oral biofilm constituent streptococci. p. gingivalis major fimbriae bind to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) present on the streptococcal surface, and this interaction plays an important role in p. gingivalis colonization. this study identified the binding domain of streptococcus oralis gapdh for p. gingivalis fimbriae. s. oralis recombinant gapdh (rgapdh) was digested with lysyl endopeptidase. cleaved fragments of rgapdh were applied to a  reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a c18 column. each peak was collected; the binding activity toward p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin (rfima) was analyzed with a biomolecular interaction analysis system.  the fragment displaying the strongest binding activity was further digested with  various proteinases, after which the binding activity of each fragment was measured. the amino acid sequence of each fragment was determined by direct sequencing, mass spectrometric analysis, and amino acid analysis. amino acid residues 166 to 183 of s. oralis gapdh exhibited the strongest binding activity toward rfima; confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 166 to 183 of s. oralis gapdh (pep166-183, dnfgvveglmttihaytg) inhibits s. oralis-p. gingivalis biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. moreover, pep166-183 inhibited interbacterial biofilm formation by several oral streptococci and p. gingivalis strains with different types of fima. these results indicate that the binding domain of s. oralis gapdh for p. gingivalis fimbriae exists within the region encompassing amino acid residues 166 to 183 of gapdh and that pep166-183 may be a potent inhibitor of p. gingivalis colonization in the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of lactoferrin on oral bacterial attachment.
AB  == introduction: lactoferrin (lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. we hypothesized that lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. the objective was to investigate the effect of lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. methods: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3 ml/min) with and without lf (100 microg/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3 h, 37 degrees c). attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) with lf-coated (20-100 microg/ml) and uncoated glass slides. the effects of beta-lactoglobulin, 2,2'-dipyridyl (25-100 microg/ml), an  iron chelator, and fecl3 on attachment were also examined. results: lf inhibited  the initial attachment of s. gordonii (50.3%, p < 0.05) but not that of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. however, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing s. gordonii (i.e. s. gordonii/f. nucleatum or s. gordonii/p. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, p < 0.05) in the presence of lf. beta-lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of s. gordonii. in the presence of 100 microm 2,2'-dipyridyl, attachment of s. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. no reduction in attachment was noted in s. gordonii pretreated with lf (100 microg/ml) and fecl3 (20-200 microm). conclusion: lf suppresses initial attachment of s. gordonii and s. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. this may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == the degree of microbiome complexity influences the epithelial response to infection.
AB  == background: the human microflora is known to be extremely complex, yet most pathogenesis research is conducted in mono-species models of infection. consequently, it remains unclear whether the level of complexity of a host's indigenous flora can affect the virulence potential of pathogenic species. furthermore, it remains unclear whether the colonization by commensal species affects a host cell's response to pathogenic species beyond the direct physical saturation of surface receptors, the sequestration of nutrients, the modulation of the physico-chemical environment in the oral cavity, or the production of bacteriocins. using oral epithelial cells as a model, we hypothesized that the virulence of pathogenic species may vary depending on the complexity of the flora that interacts with host cells. results: this is the first report that determines the global epithelial transcriptional response to co-culture with defined complex microbiota. in our model, human immortalized gingival keratinocytes (higk) were infected with mono- and mixed cultures of commensal and pathogenic species. the global transcriptional response of infected cells was validated and confirmed phenotypically. in our model, commensal species were able to modulate the expression of host genes with a broad diversity of physiological functions and antagonize the effect of pathogenic species at the cellular level. unexpectedly,  the inhibitory effect of commensal species was not correlated with its ability to inhibit adhesion or invasion by pathogenic species. conclusion: studying the global transcriptome of epithelial cells to single and complex microbial challenges offers clues towards a better understanding of how bacteria-bacteria interactions and bacteria-host interactions impact the overall host response. this work provides evidence that the degree of complexity of a mixed microbiota does influence the transcriptional response to infection of host epithelial cells, and challenges the current dogma regarding the potential versus the actual pathogenicity of bacterial species. these findings support the concept that members of the commensal oral flora have evolved cellular mechanisms that directly modulate the host cell's response to pathogenic species and dampen their relative pathogenicity.

TI  == the peri-implant sulcus compared with internal implant and suprastructure components: a microbiological analysis.
AB  == purpose: a recent in vivo study has shown considerable contamination of internal  implant and suprastructure components with great biodiversity, indicating bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface, abutment-prosthesis interface, and restorative margins. the goal of the present study was to compare  microbiologically the peri-implant sulcus to these internal components on implants with no clinical signs of peri-implantitis and in function for many years. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was used to identify and quantify 40 species. material and methods: fifty-eight turned titanium branemark implants in  eight systemically healthy patients (seven women, one man) under regular supportive care were examined. all implants had been placed in the maxilla and loaded with a screw-retained full-arch bridge for an average of 9.6 years. gingival fluid samples were collected from the deepest sulcus per implant for microbiological analysis. as all fixed restorations were removed, the cotton pellet enclosed in the intra-coronal compartment and the abutment screw were retrieved and microbiologically evaluated. results: the pellet enclosed in the suprastructure was very similar to the peri-implant sulcus in terms of bacterial  detection frequencies and levels for practically all the species included in the  panel. yet, there was virtually no microbial link between these compartments. when comparing the abutment screw to the peri-implant sulcus, the majority of the species were less frequently found, and in lower numbers at the former. however,  a relevant link in counts for a lot of bacteria was described between these compartments. even though all implants in the present study showed no clinical signs of peri-implantitis, the high prevalence of numerous species associated with pathology was striking. conclusions: intra-coronal compartments of screw-retained fixed restorations were heavily contaminated. the restorative margin may have been the principal pathway for bacterial leakage. contamination of abutment screws most likely occurred from the peri-implant sulcus via the implant-abutment interface and abutment-prosthesis interface.

TI  == proteomics of porphyromonas gingivalis within a model oral microbial community.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen that resides in a  complex multispecies microbial biofilm community known as dental plaque. confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that p. gingivalis can assemble into communities in vitro with streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum, common constituents of dental plaque. whole cell quantitative proteomics, along with mutant construction and analysis, were conducted to investigate how p. gingivalis adapts to this three species community. results: 1156 p. gingivalis proteins were detected qualitatively during comparison of the three species model community with p. gingivalis incubated alone under the same conditions. integration of spectral counting and summed signal intensity analyses of the dataset showed that 403 proteins were down-regulated and 89 proteins up-regulated. the proteomics results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. significant decreases were seen in proteins involved in cell shape and the formation of the cell envelope, as well as thiamine, cobalamin, and pyrimidine synthesis and dna repair. an overall increase was seen in proteins involved in protein synthesis. hmur, a tonb dependent outer membrane receptor, was up-regulated in the community and an hmur deficient mutant was deficient in three species community formation, but was unimpaired in its ability to form mono- or dual-species biofilms. conclusion: collectively, these results indicate that p. gingivalis can assemble into a heterotypic community with f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, and that a community lifestyle provides physiologic support for p. gingivalis. proteins such as hmur, that are up-regulated, can be necessary for community structure.

TI  == bacterial and host interactions of oral streptococci.
AB  == the oral microbial flora comprises one of the most diverse human-associated biofilms. its development is heavily influenced by oral streptococci, which are considered the main group of early colonizers. their initial attachment determines the composition of later colonizers in the oral biofilm and impacts the health or disease status of the host. thus, the role of streptococci in the development of oral diseases is best described in the context of bacterial ecology, which itself is further influenced by interactions with host epithelial  cells, the immune system, and salivary components. the tractability of the oral biofilm makes it an excellent model system for studies of complex, biofilm-associated polymicrobial diseases. using this system, numerous cooperative and antagonistic bacterial interactions have been demonstrated to occur within the community and with the host. in this review, several recent identified interactions are presented.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of  pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity  of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. methods: macrophages preinfected with hcmv or ebv were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. the virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. results: both hcmv and ebv significantly diminished the tnf-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. conclusion: infection by hcmv or ebv inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby  suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == ceragenin csa-13 exhibits antimicrobial activity against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: ceragenin csa-13 is a bile-acid-based mimic of endogenous antimicrobial peptides and shares a mechanism of action with many of these antimicrobial agents. because csa-13 is not peptide based, it is not a substrate  for the proteases that are found in the oral cavity, which are capable of degrading antimicrobial peptides. furthermore, the simplicity of the ceragenins makes them easier to prepare and purify than antimicrobial peptides. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial activities of csa-13 against oral pathogens  and found that this compound was bactericidal against all of the strains tested.  methods: the strains used were isolates of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using agar dilution methods. in susceptibility testing, viable counts were determined after  incubation with csa-13. results: csa-13 was potent against all 23 strains tested  with mics of 1-8 microg/ml for s. mutans and 1-16 microg/ml for 24 strains of the genus porphyromonas. the mic(50) was 2 and the mic(90) was 8 mug/ml for s. mutans. mic ranges for protease-positive p. gingivalis and p. cangingivalis were  2-16 microg/ml, and 1-2 microg/ml for protease-negative p. circumdentaria. csa-13 interacted with lipopolysaccharide-sensitized erythrocytes at a concentration of  5.0-20.0 microg/ml. conclusion: csa-13 displays broad-spectrum activity against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria. csa-13 was effective against protease-positive porphyromonas. it was shown to bind to erythrocytes coated with lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid from diverse bacterial strains. these results suggest that csa-13 may be useful for the prevention and treatment of oral microbial diseases.

TI  == relationship of neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival  microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) dysfunctions have been associated with severe forms of periodontitis. this study evaluated the correlation between pmn phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival microbiota of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). methods: heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained from 18 gagp patients and 11 periodontally healthy (ph) subjects, and pmns were isolated on a ficoll-hypaque gradient. for phagocytosis analysis, pmns were incubated with fluorescein-labeled staphylococcus aureus. the oxidative burst was evaluated by incubation of pmns with dihydroethidium and activation by s. aureus. the assays were examined using  flow cytometry. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from periodontal sites  with and without periodontitis and 24 species were detected by checkerboard. results: a significantly lower phagocytosis rate was observed for patients with gagp compared with ph subjects over time (p < 0.05). no differences between groups were found for superoxide production. gagp patients presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b than controls (p < 0.05). significant negative correlations between t. forsythia and p. gingivalis and pmn functions were observed. conclusions: gagp subjects presented diminished phagocytic activity of peripheral pmns and high prevalence and levels of classical periodontal pathogens.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  == background/aim: we investigated the mechanisms of adherence of salivary and serum proteins, which mimic gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), to porphyromonas gingivalis, and the effects of these adhered proteins on coaggregation and hemagglutination properties. methods: the amounts of salivary and serum proteins  adhering to p. gingivalis were determined using (3)h-labeled and non-labeled proteins. the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and streptococcus oralis or streptococcus gordonii was observed. hemagglutination was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes. proteins that interacted with zinc or copper in saliva and serum and on p. gingivalis were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results: the amount of salivary or serum proteins that adhered to the surface of p. gingivalis strains was increased by cations, especially zinc and copper ions. the pretreatment of bacterial cells with salivary or serum proteins before the assay inhibited coaggregation with gram-positive bacteria and hemagglutination. these phenomena were enhanced by the presence of zinc or copper ions during the pretreatment of p. gingivalis with proteins. we detected protein bands that were related to these cations in saliva  and serum and on p. gingivalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that zinc and copper ions markedly enhanced the adhesion and accumulation of salivary and serum proteins on cells of p. gingivalis and inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutination of p. gingivalis. these cations might be useful for limiting the settlement of p. gingivalis in the gingival sulcus with the goal of preventing periodontal disease.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

AB  == during infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. fibronectin fragments  are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. the mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. one likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. the aim of  this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (afn) exerts  its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. our data demonstrate that afn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (pdl) cells. these effects and  apoptosis were inhibited by inos suppression and enhanced by inos overexpression. nitric oxide and inos induction were paralleled by increased c-jun n-terminal kinase 1 (jnk-1) phosphorylation. jnk-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and inos, whereas inhibiting jnk-1 by small interfering rna or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. priming pdl cells with porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (lps), or gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. escherichia coli and streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to  a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via jnk-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. lps and ifn-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect  on host cells.

TI  == correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  == background: there is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. this study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) levels in older persons. methods: elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [ap]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [sp]), if they did not. groups were compared with respect to demographics, pd, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hscrp, interleukin (il)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. results: ten ap and 24 sp subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the ap group (p <0.05). most asians were sp; most whites and all african americans were classified as having ap (p <0.01). more ap elders had osteoporosis (p <0.01), but the ap and sp groups did not differ with respect to il-1beta and -6 or hscrp. bacterial counts  were higher in the ap group for parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.05), and streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; p <0.01). three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: pd, osteoporosis, and being white or african american. conclusion: periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, pd,  gender, serum hscrp, and levels of four bacterial species.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == novel anti-microbial therapies for dental plaque-related diseases.
AB  == control of dental plaque-related diseases has traditionally relied on non-specific removal of plaque by mechanical means. as our knowledge of oral disease mechanisms increases, future treatment is likely to be more targeted, for example at small groups of organisms, single species or at key virulence factors  they produce. the aim of this review is to consider the current status as regards novel treatment approaches. maintenance of oral hygiene often includes use of chemical agents; however, increasing problems of resistance to synthetic antimicrobials have encouraged the search for alternative natural products. plants are the source of more than 25% of prescription and over-the-counter preparations, and the potential of natural agents for oral prophylaxis will therefore be considered. targeted approaches may be directed at the black-pigmented anaerobes associated with periodontitis. such pigments provide an opportunity for targeted phototherapy with high-intensity monochromatic light. studies to date have demonstrated selective killing of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in biofilms. functional inhibition approaches, including the use of protease inhibitors, are also being explored to control periodontitis. replacement therapy by which a resident pathogen is replaced with  a non-pathogenic bacteriocin-producing variant is currently under development with respect to streptococcus mutans and dental caries.

TI  == biofilm microbial communities of denture stomatitis.
AB  == introduction: denture stomatitis is a common lesion that affects denture wearers. its multifactorial etiology seems to depend on a complex and poorly characterized biofilm. the purpose of this study was to assess the composition of the microbial biofilm obtained from complete denture wearers with and without denture stomatitis using culture-independent methods. methods: samples were collected from healthy denture wearers and from patients with denture stomatitis. libraries comprising about 600 cloned 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) bacterial sequences and 192  cloned eukaryotic internal transcribed spacer (its) region sequences, obtained by polymerase chain reactions, were analyzed. results: the partial 16s rdna sequences revealed a total of 82 bacterial species identified in healthy subjects and patients with denture stomatitis. twenty-seven bacterial species were detected in both biofilms, 29 species were exclusively present in patients with denture stomatitis, and 26 were found only in healthy subjects. analysis of the its region revealed the presence of candida sp. in both biofilms. conclusion: the results revealed the extent of the microbial flora, suggesting the existence of distinct biofilms in healthy subjects and in patients with denture stomatitis.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.

TI  == a porphyromonas gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase is a multifunctional regulator of virulence attributes.
AB  == low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatases (lmwtp) are widespread in prokaryotes; however, understanding of the signalling cascades controlled by these enzymes is  still emerging. porphyromonas gingivalis, an opportunistic oral pathogen, expresses a lmwtp, ltp1, that is differentially regulated in biofilm communities. here we characterize the enzymatic activity of ltp1 and, through the use of mutants that lack ltp1 or expresses catalytically defective ltp1, show that tyrosine phosphatase activity constrains both monospecies biofilm development and community development with the antecedent oral biofilm constituent streptococcus  gordonii. exopolysaccharide production is downregulated by ltp1 through transcriptional regulation of multiple genes involved in biosynthesis and transport. furthermore, ltp1 regulates transcriptional activity of luxs and thus  impacts ai-2-dependent signalling in biofilm communities. in the absence of ltp1  transcription across the hmu haemin uptake locus is reduced, and consequently uptake of haemin is impaired in the ltp1 mutant. the gingipain proteinases kgp and rgpa/b remain phosphorylated in the ltp1 mutant. phosphorylated rgps are poorly secreted, whereas cell surface activity of phosphorylated kgp is enhanced. by controlling the activity of several virulence-associated properties, ltp1 may  restrain the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis and maintain a commensal interaction with the host.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with oral streptococci requires a motif that resembles the eukaryotic nuclear receptor box protein-protein interaction domain.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis initially colonizes the oral cavity by interacting with  organisms in supragingival plaque, such as the oralis group of oral streptococci. this interaction involves the association of the streptococcal antigen i/ii with  the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa1) of p. gingivalis. our previous studies showed that a peptide (bar) derived from antigen i/ii inhibits p. gingivalis adherence and subsequent biofilm formation on streptococcal substrates. in addition, screening a combinatorial peptide library identified select amino acid substitutions in the nitvk active region of bar that increased the adherence of p. gingivalis to streptococci. here we report that incorporating these residues in a synthetic peptide results in more-potent inhibition of p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation (i(50) [50% inhibition] at 0.52 microm versus i(50) at 1.25 microm for bar). in addition, a second structural motif in bar, comprised of the amino acids kkvqdllkk, was shown to contribute to p. gingivalis  adherence to streptococci. consistent with this, the kkvqdllkk and nitvk motifs are conserved only in antigen i/ii proteins expressed by the oralis group of streptococci, which interact with p. gingivalis. interestingly, the primary and secondary structures and the functional characteristics of the amphipathic vqdll  core alpha-helix resemble the consensus nuclear receptor (nr) box protein-protein interacting domain sequence (lxxll) of eukaryotes. bar peptides containing amino  acid substitutions with the potential to disrupt the secondary structure of vqdll were less-effective inhibitors of p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation,  suggesting that the alpha-helical character of vqdll is important. furthermore, replacing the lysines that flank vqdll with acidic amino acids also reduced inhibitory activity, suggesting that the association of vqdll with mfa1 may be stabilized by a charge clamp. these results indicate that the mfa1-interacting interface of streptococcal antigen i/ii encompasses both the kkvqdllkk and nitvk  motif and suggest that the adherence of p. gingivalis to streptococci is driven by a protein-protein interaction domain that resembles the eukaryotic nr box. thus, both motifs must be taken into account in designing potential peptidomimetics that target p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation.

TI  == transcutaneous immunization with an outer membrane protein of porphyromonas gingivalis without adjuvant elicits marked antibody responses.
AB  == background/aims: we have previously reported that specific immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies induced by transcutaneous immunization (tci) with a 40-kda outer membrane protein (40k-omp) of porphyromonas gingivalis, with cholera toxin (ct) as adjuvant, inhibited coaggregation by p. gingivalis. in this study, we further  pursue the potential of the 40k-omp as a transcutaneous vaccine. methods/results: tci of rats administered 40k-omp elicited significant 40k-omp-specific serum igg  and iga, as well as salivary igg antibody titers. importantly, these antibody responses were induced without adjuvant. thus, both serum and saliva antibody titers induced by tci with the 40k-omp alone were identical to those of 40k-omp plus cholera toxin as adjuvant. the serum antibody responses induced by 40k-omp persisted for more than 140 days. on the other hand, salivary igg anti-40k-omp antibodies were gradually decreased. analysis of antibody-forming cells (afcs) confirmed the antibody titers by detecting high numbers of 40k-omp-specific igg afcs in spleen and cervical lymph node. conclusion: since 40k-omp-specific igg inhibited the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with streptococcus gordonii, and the hemagglutinin activity of p. gingivalis, tci with the 40k-omp may be important as an adjuvant-free immunogen for the prevention of chronic periodontitis.

AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

TI  == susceptibility to various oral antiseptics of porphyromonas gingivalis w83 within a biofilm.
AB  == the origin of chronic periodontal disease is strongly related to the nature and physiology of the subgingival bacterial biofilm, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is a main protagonist. this study was conducted in vitro, to test the  susceptibility of the w83 strain of p gingivalis to several oral antiseptics, bearing in mind its mode of growth as biofilm. to this end, the investigators inoculated a brain-heart infusion broth with streptococcus gordonii, to which p gingivalis was added before perfusion for 7 d via a closed circuit containing a modified robbins device. then, various antiseptics were perfused through the circuit over 30 min, and their bactericidal effects were evaluated after culture  by comparison of the mean proportion of bacteria killed. the average proportion of p gingivalis w83 killed after 15 min of contact with antiseptics was 90.51% (+/-4.78) for chlorhexidine 0.2%, 89.87% (+/-6.58) for povidone-iodine 1%, and 98.6% (+/-0.86) for listerine (mcneil-ppc, inc., morris plains, nj). after 30 min of contact, survival of p gingivalis was nil, irrespective of the antimicrobial agent used. preliminary results show that antiseptic mouth rinses, when used in pure concentrations in the traditional way, are effective in killing p gingivalis w83 within a biofilm. furthermore, in light of these experiments, it appears that the best results are obtained when listerine is used; however, new trials should  be conducted to confirm this observation.

TI  == effects of 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid and its ester derivatives on biofilm formation by two oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid, active principle isolated from acronychia baueri schott, and its ester derivatives on biofilm formation by two important oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. the parent acid and conjugates with vanillic acid, 2-hydroxynaphthoquinone and guaiacol caused a significant and reproducible inhibition of p. gingivalis biofilm formation. this effect could be related to the ability of the compounds to inhibit bacterial growth. these compounds also efficiently caused a reduction of biofilm formation by s. mutans, a phenomenon not related to growth inhibition. these data suggest that 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid and some of its ester derivatives may have a therapeutic/preventive potential for oral infections.

AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == role of the clp system in stress tolerance, biofilm formation, and intracellular  invasion in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == clp proteases and chaperones are ubiquitous among prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and in many pathogenic bacteria the clp stress response system is also involved in regulation of virulence properties. in this study, the roles of clpb, clpc, and clpxp in stress resistance, homotypic and heterotypic biofilm formation, and intracellular invasion in the oral opportunistic pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. absence of clpc and clpxp, but not clpb, resulted in diminished tolerance to high temperatures. response to oxidative stress was not affected by the loss of any of the clp proteins. the clpc and clpxp mutants demonstrated elevated monospecies biofilm formation, and the absence of clpxp also enhanced heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilm formation. all clp mutants adhered to gingival epithelial cells to the same level as the wild type; however, clpc and clpxp were found to be necessary for entry into host epithelial cells. clpb did not play a role in entry but was required for intracellular replication and survival. clpxp negatively regulated the surface exposure of the minor fimbrial (mfa) protein subunit of p. gingivalis, which stimulates biofilm formation but interferes with epithelial cell entry. collectively, these results show that the clp protease complex and chaperones control several processes that are important for the colonization and survival of p. gingivalis in the oral cavity.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and the autophagic pathway: an innate immune interaction?
AB  == autophagy is a mechanism used to maintain several intracellular functions essential to eukaryotic cells. recently, a role for autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity has also been established including the elimination of invading bacteria. although some intracellular pathogens are killed by autophagy, several  others subvert autophagy to the pathogen's benefit for survival and replication.  porphyromonas gingivalis, an important periodontal pathogen, has been shown to stimulate autophagy in endothelial cells and to use the autophagic pathway to its advantage. in human coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaec), p. gingivalis localizes within autophagosomes. after intracellular uptake, p. gingivalis transits from early autophagosomes to late autophagosomes and prevents the formation of autolysosomes, either by delaying the autophagosome-lysosome fusion  or by redirecting the normal autophagic trafficking. in addition, p. gingivalis was also found to stimulate autophagy in human aortic endothelial cells (haec) since co-localization of lc3-ii, an autophagosome marker, with p. gingivalis was  observed. the trafficking of p. gingivalis into the autophagic pathway appears to be dependent upon the host cell type. survival of p. gingivalis through the subversion of the host autophagic pathway can be considered a bacterial strategy  to evade the innate immune system and persist in the host.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == compressed mints and chewing gum containing magnolia bark extract are effective against bacteria responsible for oral malodor.
AB  == flavors and natural botanic extracts are often used in chewing gum and compressed mints for breath freshening and relief of oral malodor. the oral malodor is a result of bacterial putrification of proteinaceous materials from food or saliva. in this study, magnolia bark extract (mbe) and its two main components, magnolol  and honokiol, were evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) test.  the inhibitory effect of mbe mint was further evaluated by a kill-time assay study. in addition, an in vivo study was performed on nine healthy volunteers postlunch. saliva samples were taken before and after subjects consumed mints and gum, with and without mbe. listerine mouthwash was included as a positive control. the testing results indicated that mbe and its two main constituents demonstrated a strong germ-kill effect against bacteria responsible for halitosis and also streptococcus mutans, bacteria involved in dental caries formation. the  mic of magnolol, honokiol, and mbe on porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and s. mutans ranged from 8 to 31 microg/ml. kill-time assay results indicated that mints containing 0.2% mbe reduced more than 99.9% of three oral bacteria within 5 min of treatment. the in vivo study demonstrated that mbe containing mints reduced total salivary bacteria by 61.6% at 30 min and 33.8% at  60 min postconsumption. in comparison, the flavorless mint reduced total salivary bacteria by 3.6% at 30 min and increased total bacteria by 47.9% at 60 min. the mbe containing chewing gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 43.0% at 40 min, while placebo gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 18.0%. in conclusion, mbe demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against organisms responsible for oral malodor and can be incorporated in compressed mints and chewing gum for  improved breath-freshening benefits.

TI  == identification of a signalling molecule involved in bacterial intergeneric communication.
AB  == the development of complex multispecies communities such as biofilms is controlled by interbacterial communication systems. we have previously reported an intergeneric communication between two oral bacteria, streptococcus cristatus  and porphyromonas gingivalis, that results in inhibition of fima expression. here, we demonstrate that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of s. cristatus serves as a signal that initiates intergeneric communication. an arca-deficient mutant of s. cristatus is unable to communicate with p. gingivalis. furthermore, arginase activity is not essential for the communication, and arca retains the ability to repress expression of fima in the  presence of arginine deiminase inhibitors. these results present a novel mechanism by which intergeneric communication in dental biofilms is accomplished.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

TI  == identification of periodontopathic bacteria in gingival tissue of japanese periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: the identification of invading periodontopathic bacteria in tissues is important to determine their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.  the objective of this study was to identify periodontopathic bacteria in diseased gingival tissue of periodontitis patients. methods: subgingival plaque and gingival tissue were collected from 32 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp), 16 generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and eight localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) patients. detection frequencies and quantities of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythensis were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. the prevalences of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sobrinus were also examined and the distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes was observed. results: p. gingivalis and t. forsythensis were detected in approximately 70% of tissue samples and 50% of plaque samples in the three periodontitis groups. prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in tissue samples was higher in the lagp (63%) group  than in either the cp (16%) or the gagp (38%) group. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was detected in 50% of lagp patients. detection frequencies of s. oralis and s. sobrinus were markedly low in both plaque and tissue samples from all three periodontitis groups. amounts of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis in the tissue samples were not different among the three periodontitis groups. conclusion: p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis can localize in diseased gingival tissue and may be involved in periodontal tissue destruction. serotype c is the predominant serotype of a. actinomycetemcomitans in japanese lagp patients.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic titanium oxide for  its antiadherent and antibacterial properties.
AB  == objective: to test the antiadherent and antibacterial properties of surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic titanium oxide (tio(2)). materials and methods: tio(2) was coated on the surface of the orthodontic wires  by a sol-gel thin film dip-coating method. bacterial adhesion to the wires was evaluated by the weight change of the wires. the antibacterial activity of the surface-modified orthodontic wires was demonstrated by the dilution agar plate method for streptococcus mutans and spectrophotometry for porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the orthodontic wires coated with the photocatalytic tio(2)  showed an antiadherent effect against s. mutans compared with the uncoated wires. the bacterial mass that bound to the tio(2)-coated orthodontic wires remained unchanged, whereas that of the uncoated wires increased by 4.97%. furthermore, the tio(2)-coated orthodontic wires had a bactericidal effect on s. mutans and p. gingivalis, which cause dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. the antiadherent and antibacterial mechanisms of tio(2) to break down the cell wall of those bacteria were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. conclusion: the  surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic tio(2) can be used  to prevent the development of dental plaque during orthodontic treatment.

TI  == egg yolk-derived immunoglobulin (igy) against porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein inhibits coaggregation activity.
AB  == the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen in periodontitis, aggregates with a number of oral bacteria to form dental plaque, which is important for its colonization. we previously cloned the gene coding the 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp) of p. gingivalis 381 and produced large amounts of the recombinant (r) protein. affinity-purified rabbit antiserum against r40-kda omp effectively inhibited the coaggregation activity of p. gingivalis to oral bacteria, thus 40-kda omp was thought to be an important coaggregation factor of p. gingivalis. further, since it is conserved among many  p. gingivalis strains, this coaggregation factor may be an effective target for passive immunotherapy against p. gingivalis infection. recently, passive immunization approaches using a specific antibody produced from hen egg yolk (igy) have been developed for oral infectious diseases, and shown to be convenient and economic. in the present study, we immunized hens intramuscularly  with r40-kda omp and obtained highly purified igy from the egg yolks. the purified igy specifically recognized r40-kda omp and also reacted with a functional coaggregation-associated domain peptide of 40-kda omp. our results demonstrated that a ratio of purified igy as low as 2.5 microg/150 microl significantly inhibited the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with streptococcus gordonii, which was verified by a visual coaggregation assay and radioactivity-based quantitative micro-coaggregation assay. we concluded anti-r40-kda omp igy may be useful for passive immunization against periodontal diseases caused by p. gingivalis infection.

TI  == bacterial reduction and persistence after endodontic treatment procedures.
AB  == bacteria that persist after endodontic disinfection procedures may lead to treatment failure. over 50% of the bacteria found in endodontic infections are as-yet-uncultivated so investigations of bacteria that endure treatment procedures should include techniques that side-step cultivation. this culture-independent study evaluated the bacterial reduction promoted by intracanal disinfection procedures and identified the taxa persisting after treatment. samples taken from the infected canals of teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after instrumentation using naocl as irrigant (s2) and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3) were subjected to 16s rrna gene clone library and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. the s2 and s3 samples from five of the 15 canals showed  negative results. in the other cases, instrumentation and instrumentation/medication promoted a significant reduction (99.67% and 99.85%, respectively) in the number of bacteria when compared to s1 samples. forty-three  distinct bacterial taxa were identified, of which 24 (56%) were as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes. nineteen of these 43 taxa (including eight as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes) were disclosed in post-treatment samples, with streptococci being the most prevalent taxa. findings demonstrated that culture-independent methods provide a detailed insight into the effects of intracanal disinfection protocols, helping to define more effective strategies to deal with endodontic bacteria, including as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == profiling of bacterial flora in crevices around titanium orthodontic anchor plates.
AB  == objectives: the aims of this study were to characterize the microflora in crevices around titanium orthodontic anchor plates using anaerobic culture and molecular biological techniques for bacterial identification, and to compare the  microbial composition between crevices around anchor plates and gingival crevices. material and methods: samples from crevices around titanium anchor plates and healthy gingival crevices of 17 subjects (aged 20-29) were cultured anaerobically, and isolated bacteria were identified by 16s rrna sequencing. results: the average logarithm colony-forming units/ml were 6.84, 7.51 and 8.88 in healthy anchor plate crevices, inflamed anchor plate crevices and healthy gingival crevices, respectively, indicating that the bacterial density of anchor  plate crevices was lower than that of healthy gingival crevices. of 184 strains isolated from healthy anchor plate crevices of seven subjects, 108 (59%) were anaerobic bacteria, while 73 (40%) were facultative bacteria. predominant isolates were gram-negative rods, such as campylobacter (12%), fusobacterium (10%) and selenomonas (10%), and gram-positive facultative bacteria, such as actinomyces (17%) and streptococcus (8.2%). of 133 strains isolated from inflamed anchor plate crevices of three subjects, 110 (83%) were anaerobic bacteria, while predominant isolates were gram-negative rods, such as prevotella (47%), fusobacterium (33%) and campylobacter (16%). on the other hand, of 146 strains isolated from healthy gingival crevices of seven subjects, 98 (67%) were facultative bacteria, while 45 (31%) were anaerobic bacteria. predominant isolates were gram-positive facultative bacteria, such as actinomyces (37%) and streptococcus (20%). conclusions: these results suggest that the environment in crevices around titanium orthodontic anchor plates is anaerobic and supportive of anaerobic growth of bacteria, which may trigger inflammation in the tissue around the plates.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

AB  == introduction: in this longitudinal study, patients with fixed orthodontic appliances served as models to determine whether actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and total streptococci increased after treatment, and whether treatment affected bacterial invasion into the adjacent buccal epithelial cells (bec). methods: supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, and bec were collected from 27 patients before and at least 4 weeks after placement of orthodontic fixed appliances. total sample dna was determined, and bacteria were assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  the bec were also examined by confocal microscopy after fluorescent in-situ hybridization to visually detect the presence of each species bacteria in bec. results: total dna in supragingival and subgingival plaque increased after appliance placement (p = .005). there was also a significant increase in supragingival streptococci (p = .0002). by confocal microscopy, a trend toward fewer buccal cells recovered was found after appliance placement, and there was a significant increase in the percentage of buccal cells containing a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = .0058). conclusions: appliance placement appeared to increase buccal cell susceptibility to a. actinomycetemcomitans invasion. this might be due to physical trauma or to leaching of metals from the appliances.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius promotes mucin putrefaction and malodor production by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == although the contribution of the oral microbiota to oral malodor is well-documented, the potential role of gram-positive micro-organisms is unclear.  in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that gram-positive micro-organisms contribute to malodor production by deglycosylating oral glycoproteins, rendering them susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. to this end, we examined the effect of streptococcus salivarius on porphyromonas gingivalis-mediated putrefaction of  a model glycoprotein (pig gastric mucin). malodor was scored by two odor judges,  and volatile sulfides were determined with the use of a sulfide monitor. mucin degradation was followed by electrophoresis on sds-page. results showed that the  addition of s. salivarius or beta-galactosidase promoted mucin degradation and concomitant malodor production. addition of glycosidic inhibitors (p-aptg and glucose) inhibited this process. these results suggest that gram-positive micro-organisms such as s. salivarius contribute to oral malodor production by deglycosylating salivary glycoproteins, thus exposing their protein core to further degradation by gram-negative micro-organisms.

TI  == structural characterization of peptide-mediated inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm formation.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen whose primary niche is the anaerobic environment of subgingival dental plaque, but initial colonization of the oral cavity is likely to occur on supragingival surfaces that already support robust biofilm communities. our studies have shown that p. gingivalis adheres to  streptococcus gordonii through interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen mfa1 with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide (residues 1167 to 1193) designated bar. we show that a synthetic peptide comprising the bar sequence potently inhibits p. gingivalis adherence to s. gordonii (50% inhibitory concentration = 1.3 microm) and prevents the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. however, a retroinverso peptide that possessed the same side chain topology as that of bar was inactive, suggesting that interactions of mfa1 with the peptide backbone of bar are important for binding. a conformationally constrained analog of bar inhibited p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation but at a lower specific activity than that of bar. therefore, to further define the structural features of the mfa1-bar interaction, we functionally screened combinatorial libraries of bar in which active site residues (asn1182, thr1184, and val1185) were replaced with each of the 19 common amino acids. peptides containing positively charged amino acids at position 1182 or hydrophobic residues at position 1185 bound p. gingivalis more efficiently than did control peptides containing asn and val at these positions, suggesting that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may contribute to mfa1-sspb binding. in contrast, replacement of pro or gly at these positions was detrimental to adherence, suggesting that perturbation of the bar secondary structure influences activity.  the net effect of substitutions for thr1184 was less pronounced either positively or negatively than that at the other sites. these results define physicochemical  characteristics of the interacting interface of mfa1 and sspb and suggest that peptides or peptidomimetics with greater specific inhibitory activity than that of bar can be developed. these compounds may represent potential therapeutics that target some of the first molecular interactions that allow p. gingivalis to  colonize the oral cavity.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in community development with streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the causative agents of adult periodontitis, develops biofilm microcolonies on substrata of streptococcus gordonii but not on  streptococcus mutans. p. gingivalis genome microarrays were used to identify genes differentially regulated during accretion of p. gingivalis in heterotypic biofilms with s. gordonii. thirty-three genes showed up- or downregulation by array analysis, and differential expression was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr. the functions of the regulated genes were predominantly related to metabolism and energy production. in addition, many of the genes have  no current known function. the roles of two upregulated genes, ftsh (pg0047) encoding an atp-dependent zinc metallopeptidase and ptpa (pg1641) encoding a putative tyrosine phosphatase, were investigated further by mutational analysis.  strains with mutations in these genes developed more abundant biofilms with s. gordonii than the parental strain developed. ftsh and ptpa may thus participate in a regulatory network that constrains p. gingivalis accumulation in heterotypic biofilms. this study provided a global analysis of p. gingivalis transcriptional  responses in an oral microbial community and also provided insight into the regulation of heterotypic biofilm development.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == increased plasma levels of il-6 in bacteremic periodontis patients after scaling.
AB  == bacteremia frequently occurs after dental treatment. periodontal inflammation may influence the incidence, magnitude and duration of bacteremia. the presence of circulating oral bacteria or bacterial components may induce cytokine synthesis in blood cells, which may contribute to the development or exacerbation of atherosclerosis. the present study tested the hypothesis that bacteremia occurring after scaling in periodontitis patients results in altered plasma levels of cytokines. twenty periodontitis patients were subjected to scaling. blood samples at baseline and at 0.5, 10 and 30 minutes postscaling were examined for bacteremia whereas baseline and eight-hour postscaling blood samples were examined for the levels of il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-6, il-8, il-10 and il-12p70. il-6 levels were significantly increased eight hours after scaling, while il-8 was significantly decreased. no systematic changes occurred in the levels of il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-10 and il-2p70. il-6 levels may be increased while il-8 may be decreased due to scaling, which may have implications for general health.

TI  == detection and measurement of oral malodour in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background & objectives: malodour has been correlated with the concentration of volatile sulphur compounds produced in the oral cavity by metabolic activity of bacteria colonizing the periodontal sites and the dorsum of the tongue. the aim of this study was to detect malodour in mouth air organoleptically and using a portable sulphide monitor and to correlate it with the clinical parameters, halitosis linked toxins and bana, using tongue and subgingival plaque samples. the halitosis grading is also correlated with the microbial colonies of the subgingival plaque sample. methods: 20 patients with chronic periodontitis with 5-7 mm pocket depth, radiographic evidence of bone loss and presence of oral malodour participated in this study. assessment of mouth air was done organoleptically and by using a portable sulphide monitor. the clinical parameter, plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), gingival bleeding index (bi),  were obtained from all the areas. samples for bana and to detect halitosis linked toxins were taken from the dorsal surface of the tongue and periodontal pockets ranging 5-7 mm. halitosis related microbial colonies were identified using anaerobic culturing from the subgingival plaque. results: the scores of pi, gi, bi and sample that tested positive for halitosis linked toxins and with the halitosis grading were not significant. the presence of tongue coating and the halitosis grading and toxin levels were significant. bana has shown to be non contributory due to technical problems. anaerobic culture has shown to identify streptococcus, bacteroides, fusobacterium, porphyromonas and prevotella colonies. interpretation & conclusion: the results confirmed that there was no correlation  between the clinical parameters, halitosis linked toxins and halitosis grading. the microbial colonies have shown to correlate with the presence of oral malodour.

TI  == antimicrobial barrier of an in vitro oral epithelial model.
AB  == objective: oral epithelia function as a microbial barrier and are actively involved in recognizing and responding to bacteria. our goal was to examine a tissue engineered model of buccal epithelium for its response to oral bacteria and proinflammatory cytokines and compare the tissue responses with those of a submerged monolayer cell culture. design: the tissue model was characterized for  keratin and beta-defensin expression. altered expression of beta-defensins was evaluated by rt-pcr after exposure of the apical surface to oral bacteria and after exposure to tnf-alpha in the medium. these were compared to the response in traditional submerged oral epithelial cell culture. results: the buccal model showed expression of differentiation specific keratin 13, hbd1 and hbd3 in the upper half of the tissue; hbd2 was not detected. hbd1 mrna was constitutively expressed, while hbd2 mrna increased 2-fold after exposure of the apical surface  to three oral bacteria tested and hbd3 mrna increased in response to the non-pathogenic bacteria tested. in contrast, hbd2 mrna increased 3-600-fold in response to bacteria in submerged cell culture. hbd2 mrna increased over 100-fold in response to tnf-alpha in the tissue model and 50-fold in submerged cell culture. thus, the tissue model is capable of upregulating hbd2, however, the minimal response to bacteria suggests that the tissue has an effective antimicrobial barrier due to its morphology, differentiation, and defensin expression. conclusions: the oral mucosal model is differentiated, expresses hbd1 and hbd3, and has an intact surface with a functional antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == potentiation of the bactericidal activity of harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) leaf extract against oral bacteria using poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles: in vitro study.
AB  == harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) is known to have biological properties with mainly antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the ethyl acetate h. madagascariensis leaf extract (hle) on the main  oral bacterial strains largely implicated in dental caries and gingivitis infections, and the possibility of potentialization of hle antibacterial effects  using the poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (plg-np). the microdilution technique and the interfacial polymer deposition following the solvent diffusion method were used to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of ethyl acetate hle and to prepare nanoparticles, respectively. hle showed significant bactericidal effects against the bacterial strains tested, with minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to 5 x 10(2) mg/l or less, except for lactobacillus casei with 7.5 x 10(2) mg/l. with the hle incorporated into plg nanoparticles (hle-plg-np), we observed diminution of the bactericidal concentration compared to hle, the upper mbc being of 1.875 x 10(2) mg/l. incorporation of the hle into a colloidal carrier optimized its antibacterial performance.

TI  == bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == selective inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor xa inhibitor, dx-9065a.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. however, there is no drug specific for p. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. objectives: the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor x, dx-9065a, on growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we incubated p. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of dx-9065a and examined the effect of dx-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. we also examined the effects of dx9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains rgpa and rgpb), from p. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. results: dx-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, and its effect on p. gingivalis was bactericidal. trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected  in p. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. dx-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of rgpa and rgpb from p. gingivalis. furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. conclusions: dx-9065a inhibits p. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in p. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of  teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of  85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue  care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI  == streptococcus gordonii utilizes several distinct gene functions to recruit porphyromonas gingivalis into a mixed community.
AB  == dental plaque biofilm formation proceeds through a developmental pathway initiated by the attachment of pioneer organisms, such as streptococcus gordonii, to tooth surfaces. through a variety of synergistic interactions, pioneer organisms facilitate the colonization of later arrivals including porphyromonas gingivalis, a potential periodontal pathogen. we have investigated genes of s. gordonii required to support a heterotypic biofilm community with p. gingivalis.  by screening a plasmid integration library of s. gordonii, genes were identified  that are crucial for the accumulation of planktonic p. gingivalis cells into a multispecies biofilm. these genes were further investigated by specific mutation  and complementation analyses. the biofilm-associated genes can be grouped into broad categories based on putative function as follows: (i) intercellular or intracellular signalling (cbe and spxb), (ii) cell wall integrity and maintenance of adhesive proteins (mure, msra and atf), (iii) extracellular capsule biosynthesis (pgsa and atf), and (iv) physiology (gdha, ccma and ntpb). in addition, a gene for a hypothetical protein was identified. biofilm visualization and quantification by confocal microscopy confirmed the role of these genes in the maturation of the multispecies community, including biofilm architectural development. the results suggest that s. gordonii governs the development of heterotypic oral biofilms through multiple genetic pathways.

TI  == effect of calcium glycerophosphate on demineralization in an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  == the aim was to investigate the anti-caries properties of calcium glycerophosphate (cagp) using an in vitro bacterial flow cell model. four flow cells, inoculated from a chemostat containing a seven-organism bacterial consortium, were pulsed with sucrose twice daily, to provide an acidic challenge and ph-cycling conditions. blocks of enamel and dentine were mounted in each flow cell. in a study on the effect of cagp concentration, cagp was pulsed into three of the flow cells, at the same time as the sucrose, to give concentrations of 0.10, 0.25 and  0.50%. water was pulsed into the fourth flow cell with the sucrose. microradiography revealed a significant dose response of decreasing demineralization as cagp concentration increased. reductions at 0.25 and 0.5% were significant when compared to the control. a second study investigated the effect of timing of cagp pulsing, relative to sucrose, on enamel and dentine demineralization. cagp (flow cell concentration 0.2%), was pulsed 1 h before, during or 1 h after the sucrose pulse; a water control was employed. in enamel, pulsing cagp before the sucrose reduced demineralization significantly compared to concurrent pulsing, which in turn gave a significant reduction compared to pulsing after sucrose, which did not reduce demineralization significantly compared to the water control. in dentine, cagp reduced demineralization significantly only when pulsed before the sucrose. the findings suggest that in vivo, the anti-caries potential of cagp may be greater if it is applied before a  cariogenic challenge.

AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == novel subgingival bacterial phylotypes detected using multiple universal polymerase chain reaction primer sets.
AB  == introduction: molecular ecological analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis is well established for the characterisation of complex bacterial communities. however, 'universal' pcr primers can introduce biases into the analysis of the species composition of clone libraries because of mismatches between the primer and target organism sequences. in this study, three universal  primer sets were compared for the analysis of the microflora in subgingival plaque. methods: three subgingival plaque samples were collected from two subjects with localised severe chronic periodontitis. half of each sample was cultured while dna was extracted from the remaining half and 16s rdna amplified with universal primer pairs 27f, 1525r (a); 27f, 1492r (b) and 530f, 1525r (c). amplified genes were cloned, sequenced and identified by comparison with 16s rrna databases. results: 137 taxa were identified among 177 isolates and 417 clones sequenced. of these, 86 were detected only by the molecular technique whereas 26  were found only by culture. sequences from 81 taxa did not correspond to those of named species and of these, 38 were not represented in the nucleotide databases.  16s rna genes for these 38 taxa were sequenced and deposited with genbank. conclusion: the use of three sets of universal primers allowed the identification of 38 novel bacterial phylotypes. there were marked differences in the composition of the libraries generated by the different primer sets. a combination of molecular and cultural techniques is recommended to maximise the coverage of detection of bacterial taxa in oral samples.

TI  == a new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aims: various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently  identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization method. methods: fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least  one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). one diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic  probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. results: twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than  healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). a significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, and eikenella corrodens). of the species in the new panel only prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis, and porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. conclusion: it was concluded that p. tannerae, f. alocis, and p. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.

TI  == commensal oral bacteria antigens prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2 or treg differentiation.
AB  == in various immunopathologic conditions, bacterial flora induce an immune response which results in inflammatory manifestations, e.g. periapical granuloma. dendritic cells provide the main orchestration of specific immune responses. the  aim of our study was to test the capacity of distinct oral bacterial antigens (prepared from streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides spp.) to prime human dendritic cells for stimulation of the t-lymphocyte response. to assess the t-lymphocyte response, the expression of cd25, cd69, intracellular interferon gamma (cifn-gamma), and intracellular interleukin 4 (cil-4) was determined. dendritic cells were prepared from leukocyte buffy coat from healthy blood donors. monocytes were stimulated with il-4 and gm-csf and dendritic cells activated with bacterial lysates. cell suspensions contained up to 90% dendritic cells, which represented 2-12% of the initial number of mononuclear cells. lymphocyte subsets that developed in lymphocyte cultures after 1 week of stimulation were analyzed by flow cytometry. dendritic cells, primed with antigens of bacteroides fragilis have shown significantly higher activation  and expression of intercellular ifn-gamma by t lymphocytes compared to negative controls. the dendritic cells primed with antigens of p. acnes had no effect on t-lymphocyte activation or cytokine production; instead they induced differentiation of t lymphocytes into cd25bright cells (regulatory t cells) with  a potentially inhibitory effect on immune response. dendritic cells primed with antigens of s. mitis induced increased expression of cil-4. we conclude that commensal oral bacteria antigens prepared from b. fragilis, s. mitis, and p. acnes prime human dendritic cells to induce th1, th2, and t(reg) differentiation, respectively. this may advance our understanding of immunopathologic manifestations in the oral cavity and offer new possibilities for redirecting immune responses in mucosal vaccination.

AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

TI  == [bacterial spectra and antibiotics in odontogenic infections. renaissance of the  penicillins?].
AB  == background: the role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. an extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. material and methods: bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. results: a total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. the ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. the most frequent aerobes were members of the genera streptococcus (46 isolates), staphylococcus (10 isolates), and neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. the anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera eubacterium (19 isolates), peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and actinomyces (12 isolates). the most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were prevotella (46 isolates), and fusobacterium (21 isolates). the overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin g/v, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. the resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. penicillin g presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin g. the other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. penicillin g was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. the resistance rates were: penicillin g 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.

TI  == microbial analysis of the autogenous bone collected by bone filter during oral surgery: a clinical study.
AB  == purpose: the purposes of the study presented are to identify the microbial content of the collected bone debris and to determine the antibacterial efficiency of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing the microbial content of the  collected bone debris. patients and methods: twenty-five patients who had asymptomatic fully impacted mandibular third molars bilaterally underwent surgical removal for prophylactic and orthodontic considerations. immediately before surgery all patients rinsed with 10 ml of their assigned solution (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) for 2 minutes. before surgical removal of the teeth, bone debris was collected with a stringent aspiration protocol from the ramus by bone filter. the microbial content of the bone debris was assessed and the bacterial levels between the 2 groups were compared statistically. results: all samples from both groups (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) yielded viable microorganisms. there was no significant difference between the mean/median colony-forming units (cfu)/g values of both group samples, for aerobes (streptococcus salivarius) and anaerobes (bacteroides, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and veillonella species). with regard to total microorganisms, the mean cfu/g derived from the chlorhexidine group samples were  1.5 x 10(8) cfu/g per bone sample compared with 1.5 x 10(9) cfu/g for the sterile saline control group (p < .05). conclusion: although chlorhexidine rinsing immediately before surgery reduced the levels of total microorganisms when compared with stringent aspiration protocol alone, it has not been found effective on aerobic streptococcus salivarius and, importantly, on anaerobes. the reduced bacterial levels may still carry high infectious risk and may lead to failure in autogenous grafting procedures in oral surgery.

TI  == antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection {pad} used on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and in artificial and human root canals.
AB  == objectives: to measure antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection (pad)  on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and root canals. methods: four bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum,peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus intermedius, were tested in suspension. after mixing equal volumes of tolonium chloride and bacterial suspension for 60s, each 200 microl of concentration (>10(6)cfu ml(-1)) was irradiated with light at 633+/-2 nm. each energy dose/tolonium chloride concentration combination was tested eight times, with controls. prepared root canals in training blocs and extracted human  teeth were inoculated with s. intermedius followed by 10 mg l(-1) tolonium chloride or saline. bacteria in canals were sampled before and after light irradiation. student t-test assessed significance of changes in viable bacteria produced by treatment of either light or tolonium chloride alone and light/tolonium chloride combinations. results: in suspension, reductions in bacteria were highly significant (p<0.01) for light/tolonium chloride combinations compared to light or tolonium chloride alone. maximum mean log reductions of 1.14 (p. intermedia), 2.48 (p. micros), 2.81 (f. nucleatum) and 6.73 (s. intermedius) were at 4.8 j/20 mg l(-1). antibacterial action was increased by energy dose increase (not always significantly), but not by tolonium chloride concentration. in control canals mean log reductions of 0.42 (blocs) and 0.38 (teeth) from initial levels were not significant. pad mean log reductions of 2.40 (blocs) and 2.01 (teeth) were highly significant. changes for pad/energy dose combinations were not significant. conclusion: pad killed endodontic bacteria at statistically significant levels compared to controls. kills varied with bacterial species.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

AB  == an online database of proteomes for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2de) gel data was constructed and it is now freely accessible through a web-based interface. proteins from three oral bacteria, streptococcus mutans ua159, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans hk1651, and porphyromonas gingivalis w83, whose genome databases are freely available, were separated by 2de, and protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (maldi-tof) and identified. about 1000 spots from the gels of p. gingivalis w83 were extracted and analyzed by maldi-tof, and 330 proteins were identified. in addition, 160 of 240 spots of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 158 of 356 spots of s. mutans were identified. information such as spot coordinates on the gels, protein names (predicted functions), molecular weights, isoelectroric points, and links to online databases, including oral pathogen sequence databases of the los alamos national laboratory bioscience division (oralgen) and national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) or the institute genomic research (tigr), were stored in tables accessible through the relational database management system mysql on an apache web server. to test for functionality of this database system, responses of s. mutans to environmental changes were analyzed using the database  and 21 spots on the gel were identified as proteins whose expression had been increased or decreased by environmental ph change without in-gel trypsin digestion, protein extraction, or maldi-tof/tof-ms (mass spectrometer) analysis.  the identified proteins are agreement with those reported in previous papers on acid tolerance of s. mutans, demonstrating the usefulness of the system. this database is available at http://www.myamagu.dent.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~bioinformatics/index.html or http://www.bipos.mascat.nihon-u.ac.jp/index.html.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == interactions of oral pathogens with toll-like receptors: possible role in atherosclerosis.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlr) function as important signal transducers that mediate innate immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens through pattern recognition of virulence molecules. although tlrs mediate protection against infection, it is also likely that they may have a pathophysiologic role in certain inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. in atherosclerotic lesions, endothelial cells  and macrophages have been shown to upregulate tlr expression and may respond to tlr agonists of microbial origin, resulting in detrimental inflammatory reactions. some of these potential tlr-activating virulence factors may be of oral origin. the detection in atherosclerotic plaques of dna specific for porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens suggests that these pathogens disseminate into the systemic circulation and localize in atheromas. the potential of periodontal and some other oral pathogens to activate tlrs in vivo is suggested by findings from cell culture experiments on interactions of selected virulence protein adhesins with tlrs and their coreceptors. specifically, we have shown that proinflammatory cytokine induction by p. gingivalis fimbriae was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to tlr2, tlr4, cd14, and beta2 integrins, but not by immunoglobulin isotype controls. cytokine induction by bacteroides forsythus protein a depended heavily on cd14 and tlr2. we also found that the ability of streptococcus mutans protein agi/ii to stimulate cytokine release was partially dependent on cd14 and tlr4. moreover, p. gingivalis fimbriae induced tlr-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappab and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in monocytic cells. these proinflammatory activities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and similar inflammatory mechanisms could potentially operate in atherosclerosis. studies by  other groups have shown that p. gingivalis is capable of stimulating low-density  lipoprotein oxidation, foam cell formation, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque through induction of matrix metalloproteinases. interestingly, at least some of these activities can be induced by tlr agonists (lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock protein-60) from chlamydia pneumoniae, a major risk factor in atherosclerosis. future research in animal models and in vitro cellular systems with defined mutations in tlrs may implicate tlr participation in oral pathogen-mediated atherosclerotic processes, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the epidemiological findings linking oral pathogens to atherosclerotic  disease.

TI  == the salivary microbiota as a diagnostic indicator of oral cancer: a descriptive,  non-randomized study of cancer-free and oral squamous cell carcinoma subjects.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine if the salivary counts of 40 common oral bacteria in subjects with an oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) lesion would differ from those found in cancer-free (oscc-free)  controls. methods: unstimulated saliva samples were collected from 229 oscc-free  and 45 oscc subjects and evaluated for their content of 40 common oral bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. dna counts per ml saliva were determined for each species, averaged across subjects in the 2 subject groups, and significance of differences between groups determined using the mann-whitney  test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in detection of oscc by levels of salivary organisms were computed and comparisons made separately between a non-matched group of 45 oscc subjects and 229 controls and a group of 45 oscc subjects and 45 controls matched by age,  gender and smoking history. results: counts of 3 of the 40 species tested, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus mitis, were elevated in the saliva of individuals with oscc (p < 0.001). when tested as  diagnostic markers the 3 species were found to predict 80% of cancer cases (sensitivity) while excluding 83% of controls (specificity) in the non-matched group. diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the matched group were 80% and 82% respectively. conclusion: high salivary counts of c. gingivalis, p. melaninogenica and s. mitis may be diagnostic indicators of oscc.

TI  == short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis and their role in coadhesion with streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the causative agents of adult periodontitis, attaches and forms biofilms on substrata of streptococcus gordonii. coadhesion and biofilm development between these organisms requires the interaction of the short fimbriae of p. gingivalis with the sspb streptococcal surface polypeptide.  in this study we investigated the structure and binding activities of the short fimbriae of p. gingivalis. electron microscopy showed that isolated short fimbriae have an average length of 103 nm and exhibit a helical structure with a  pitch of ca. 27 nm. mfa1, the major protein subunit of the short fimbriae, bound  to sspb protein, and this reaction was inhibited by purified recombinant mfa1 and monospecifc anti-mfa1 serum in a dose-dependent manner. complementation of a polar mfa1 mutant with the mfa1 gene restored the coadhesion phenotype of p. gingivalis. hence, the mfa1 structural fimbrial subunit does not require accessory proteins for binding to sspb. furthermore, the interaction of mfa1 with sspb is necessary for optimal coadhesion between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii.

TI  == multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
AB  == objective: zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. methods: the oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. biofilm growth involved super-infection by f. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by streptococcus sanguis. results: zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by f. nucleatum cells in suspensions with id(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mm. the id(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mm.  inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by p. intermedia with id(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mm, respectively. respiration of intact cells of f. nucleatum and nadh oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with id(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mm. zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by f. nucleatum (id(50) = ca. 0.04 mm.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. conclusion: zn(2+) is a  potent inhibitor of catabolism by f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. zn(2+) also inhibits o(2) metabolism of f. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.

AB  == successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for  differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for  detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. we postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue  categories. each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.

AB  == garlic (allium sativum) has long been known to have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties but there are few data on its effects against oral bacterial species particularly putative periodontal pathogens or their enzymes. filter sterilised, aqueous extract of garlic was tested for ability to inhibit the growth of a range of oral species and to inhibit the trypsin-like and total protease activity porphyromonas gingivalis. the garlic extract (57.1% (w/v), containing 220 microg/ml allicin) inhibited the growth and killed most of the organisms tested. in general, the minimal inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the gram-negative strains (garlic mic range 35.7-1.1 mg/ml; allicin mean mic 4.1 microg/ml; mean mbc 7.9 microg/ml) were lower than those for the gram-positive strains tested (garlic mic range 142.7-35.7 mg/ml; allicin mean mic 27.5 microg/ml; mean mbc 91.9 microg/ml). also, of the organisms tested, the  putative periodontal pathogens had among the lowest mics (17.8-1.1 mg/ml garlic)  and mbcs (35.7-1.1 mg/ml garlic). time-kill curves for streptococcus mutans and p. ginigvalis, showed that killing of the latter started almost immediately, whereas there was a delay before s. mutans was killed. the garlic extract also inhibited the trypsin-like and total protease activity of p. gingivalis by 92.7%  and 94.88%, respectively. these data indicate that garlic extract inhibits the growth of oral pathogens and certain proteases and so may have therapeutic value, particularly for periodontitis.

TI  == phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

AB  == introduction: this study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) criteria. methods: a complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the mic90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. for  drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above mic (t > mic)  was calculated. for drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the auc/mic was calculated. results: amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. the spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory pk/pd indexes. conclusion: pk/pd indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. the pk/pd simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.

TI  == [the antimicrobial effects of chitosans on oral pathogenic microbes in vitro].
AB  == purpose: to study the antimicrobial activities of chitosans of different molecular weights and concentrations on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5 in  vitro. methods: the inhibition effects of chitosans of different molecular weights and different concentrations (2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%) on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis in culture were investigated, and the differences of their antimicrobial activities under high temperature and after filtering were compared. one way analysis of variance, randomized block design analysis of variance and t test were used for statistical analysis. results: chitosans of different molecular weights all showed bacteriostatic effects on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. low molecular weight chitosans showed the strongest effects, but the high molecular weight ones had strong effects on streptococcus mutans (p<0.05,0.01). the bacteriostatic effects of chitosans were not affected by high temperatures (p>0.05). conclusion: chitosans have inhibitory effects on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == phototoxic effect of visible light on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum: an in vitro study.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of visible light irradiation combined with photosensitizers has been reported. the objective of this was to test the effect  of visible light irradiation without photosensitizers on the viability of oral microorganisms. strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus faecalis in suspension or grown on agar were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400-500 nm. these wavelengths are used to photopolymerize composite resins widely used for dental restoration. three photocuring light sources, quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp, light-emitting diode and plasma-arc, at power densities between 260 and 1300 mw/cm2 were used for up to 3 min. bacterial samples were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. the results show that blue light sources exert a phototoxic effect on p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the minimal inhibitory dose for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was 16-62 j/cm2, a value significantly lower than that for s. mutans and s. faecalis (159-212 j/cm2). near-infrared diode laser irradiation did not affect any of the bacteria tested. our results suggest that visible light sources without exogenous photosensitizers have a phototoxic effect mainly on gram-negative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == increase in cariogenic bacteria after initial periodontal therapy.
AB  == this study examined the hypothesis of an intra-oral shift, during initial periodontal therapy, from a periopathogenic to a cariogenic flora. seventy-one patients with periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment strategies: (1) scaling and root planing, quadrant by quadrant, at two-week intervals (nc); (2) full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hrs (frp); or (3) full-mouth disinfection within 24 hrs, including antiseptics [chlorhexidine (chx) or amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (f) for 2 mos, or chx for 2 mos followed by f for 6 mos (chx+f)]. at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 mos, bacterial samples were taken from supra- and subgingival plaque, saliva, and tongue. the detection frequencies and relative proportions of streptococcus mutans increased in the nc and frp groups, but decreased in the f group. in the chx group, these species disappeared temporarily, but they disappeared for the entire 8 mos in the chx+f group. these observations were similar for all sample locations. the periopathogens decreased in all groups. this finding confirms the  abovementioned hypothesis and indicates a need for caries prophylactic regimens.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics against periodontopathogenic bacteria within epithelial cells: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: periodontopathogenic bacteria can invade and survive within epithelial cells, but susceptibility of intracellular infection to antibiotics used in periodontitis treatment has not been studied to date. methods: kb cells were infected by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, strain nctc 9710; porphyromonas gingivalis, strains atcc 33277 and jh16-1; or streptococcus constellatus, strain j012b. after 2, 4, and 12 hours the bactericidal effect of antibiotics (clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin) on intracellular microorganisms was tested at a concentration up to the 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined separately on planktonic bacteria. results: the p. gingivalis strains differed in their invasiveness and atcc 33277 was 100-fold more invasive than jh16-1. doxycycline and clindamycin at a concentration 10-fold mic had no effect, but p. gingivalis intercellular infection was significantly reduced by metronidazole at 10-fold mic after 2 and 4 hours. moxifloxacin was effective, but a 100-fold mic concentration was necessary to reduce p. gingivalis strains intracellular growth to 7% of the control. other  bacterial species grown inside the kb cells were more susceptible to antibiotics. clindamycin at 10-fold mic reduced the number of intracellular s. constellatus after 4 and 12 hours. this bacterium was eliminated by moxifloxacin at 50-fold mic. intracellular a. actinomycetemcomitans was killed by 10-fold mic of doxycycline and moxifloxacin after 4 hours incubation. conclusions: moxifloxacin  was the most efficient antibiotic to treat intracellular infection. however, taking into account the mic values and the levels of antibiotics in gingival fluid, elimination of intracellular bacteria by antibiotics alone seems to be questionable.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of endodontic files after cleaning and steam sterilization procedures.
AB  == background: infection control procedures are essential for modern dental practice and they are continually evolving to meet the dental profession's high standards. the present study evaluated the efficacy of two cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers on endodontic files, and evaluated the effect of biological debris on the subsequent sterilization of files. methods: stainless steel and nickel-titanium (niti) files were examined upon removal from the manufacturer's packaging, after instrumentation in root canals of human teeth inoculated with a  broth containing two anaerobic species and one facultative anaerobic species of bacteria, and after instrumentation and cleaning with either an ultrasonic bath or a thermal disinfector. for each file, the bacterial numbers were quantified using routine microbiological techniques in an anaerobic chamber. results: no bacteria were detected from files direct from their packets. the size, taper and  type of file did not affect the ability of either of the cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers. however, an absence of bacteria was more likely when files were cleaned in the thermal disinfector. no bacteria were detected from files that were-subjected to steam sterilization irrespective of the type of prior cleaning procedure. conclusions: steam sterilization eliminated all bacteria from the endodontic files irrespective of the presence of biological debris. the majority of bacteria were eliminated from endodontic files after either ultrasonic cleaning or using a thermal disinfector.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == [purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus sanguis].
AB  == objective: streptococcus sanguis plays an important role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by s. sanguis has a prominent function  of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (ppb). the aim of  this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. methods: the raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of s. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose  gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. the characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on ppb was measured by agar diffusion test. results: the purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by  sds-page, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). the purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in vitro. conclusion: our methods are useful for the  purification of sanguicin. sanguicin has inhibitory effect on ppb obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction identification of microorganisms in previously root-filled teeth in a south korean population.
AB  == a large body of evidence indicates that microorganisms are the primary causative  agents of endodontic treatment failures. this study intended to assess the occurrence of nine putative endodontic pathogens in root-filled teeth associated  with periradicular lesions in a south korean population using a culture-independent molecular approach. fourteen root-filled teeth with persistent periradicular diseases were selected for retreatment. after removal of the root canal filling, the canals were sampled, and a polymerase chain reaction  assay using taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers was used for microbial detection. bacteria were present in all cases, as revealed by amplification using ubiquitous 16s rdna primers. the most frequently detected taxon was enterococcus  faecalis (64%), followed by streptococcus spp. (21%) and tannerella forsythensis  (14%). the results of this study using a highly sensitive identification method are concurrent with those from other geographical locations using diverse identification methods in that e. faecalis is the main species found in cases of  root-filled teeth associated with periradicular lesions.

TI  == efficacy of ozone on survival and permeability of oral microorganisms.
AB  == in the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water on oral microorganisms and dental plaque. almost no microorganisms were detected after being treated with ozonated water (4 mg/l) for 10 s. to estimate the ozonated water-treated streptococcus mutans, bacterial cells were stained with live/dead baclight bacterial viability kit. fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that s. mutans cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water. some breakage of ozonated water-treated s. mutans was found by electron microscopy. when the experimental dental plaque was exposed to ozonated water, the number of viable s. mutans remarkably decreased. ozonated water strongly inhibited the accumulation of experimental dental plaque in vitro. after the dental plaque samples from human subjects were exposed to ozonated water in vitro, almost no viable bacterial cells were detected. these results suggest that ozonated water should be useful in reducing the infections caused by oral microorganisms in dental plaque.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == comparison of type 1 and type 2 cytokine production by mononuclear cells cultured with streptococcus mutans and selected other caries bacteria.
AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics to strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria within a single species biofilm - an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this study examined differences in the efficacy of antibiotics against a single strain of three periodontal pathogens grown in an artificial biofilm. methods: single species biofilms were established with artificial saliva and one of the following bacterial strains: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  y4, streptococcus constellatus 384b (a clinical isolate) and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277. the efficacy of the antibiotics clindamycin, doxycycline,  metronidazole, and moxifloxacin to these bacteria was determined using concentrations up to 100-fold minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to planctonic bacteria over 48 h. results: the ability of the bacteria to form a biofilm varied. the biofilms of s. constellatus 384b and a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 contained more viable bacteria and showed a larger thickness in sem photographs than those of p. gingivalis atcc 33277. the antibiotics tested showed different efficacy for the different strains. moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic: onefold mic was sufficient to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 after 48 h. however, only the 50-fold mic completely eradicated s. constellatus 384b. sem photographs underlined the damaging effect of moxifloxacin on the biofilm structure. conclusion: the complete removal of bacteria by the use of antibiotics alone seems to be impossible when taking into  account mic values and the level of antibiotics in gingival fluid.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to confirm the relationships between oral malodor  and periodontal condition, oral malodor and tongue coating, and to investigate the secretory-immunoglobulin a (s-iga) level in saliva in relation to the accumulation of tongue coating. methods: fifty-four patients complaining of oral  malodor were included in the study. their periodontal conditions, tongue coating  status and salivary characteristics (flow rate, protein and s-iga concentrations) were assessed in addition to the level of volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) in oral cavity. the patients were divided into three groups according to their tongue coating level. results: there are significant relationships between oral malodor  and specific periodontal parameters used. the degree of tongue coating was also significantly correlated with the amount of h2s, ch3sh and the total amount of vsc determined. the concentration of s-iga in the group identified as slight tongue coating was significantly higher than in the moderate or the severe group. by western immunoblotting analysis, a high level of s-iga specific to streptococcus species was recognized in all groups, whereas the reactivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum with s-iga was very weak in  both the slight and the moderate groups. conclusion: data herein indicate that tongue coating is closely related to oral malodor. furthermore, s-iga in saliva may influence the accumulation of tongue coating, and s-iga antibodies directed to streptococcus species may play a role in protective immunity against the initial colonization of tongue plaque.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == bacterial colonization during de novo plaque formation.
AB  == objective: to determine microbial changes that occur during plaque formation in a dentition free of gingival inflammation. material and methods: ten subjects were  recruited. the study included one preparatory period (2 weeks) and a plaque accumulation period (4 days). the volunteers exercised proper tooth cleaning methods, were scaled and received repeated professional mechanical tooth cleaning during the preparatory period. during the plaque accumulation period, the participants abstained from plaque control measures. plaque was scored on the approximal surfaces of maxillary and mandibular premolars on days 0, 1, 2 and 4 using a scale from 0 to 5 and according to the criteria of the quigley and hein plaque index (qhi). supragingival plaque samples were obtained from the same intervals and surfaces and evaluated using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the mean qhi increased from 0 to 1.6 (day 4). the total number of organisms on day 0 averaged 140 x 10(5) and increased to about 210 x 10(5) after 4 days without oral hygiene. the most dominant species on day 0 were  members of the genus actinomyces. these organisms comprised almost 50% of the microbiota evaluated. none of the actinomyces species increased significantly during the 4 days. some streptococcus species increased significantly over time as well as species of the genera capnocytophaga, campylobacter, fusobacteria and  actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: in the present investigation, the  preparatory phase established a situation with minimal gingival inflammation and  close to zero amounts of dental plaque. the day 0 plaque samples exhibited high proportions of actinomyces species. during the 4 days of no oral hygiene, there was a small increase in total numbers of organisms as well as a modest increase in the proportion of "disease-associated" taxa such as species of the "orange complex" species.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

AB  == our aim was to investigate bacteremia caused by surgical extraction of partly erupted mandibular third molars. from 16 young adults, bacterial samples were taken from the third-molar pericoronal pocket and post-operatively from the extraction socket, and blood samples were drawn from the ante-cubital vein up to  30 min after surgery. of the subjects, 88% had detectable bacteremia-50% 1 min after the incision, 44% immediately after extraction. the respective percentages  at 10, 15, and 30 min were 44%, 25%, and 13%. blood cultures contained 31 species (74% anaerobes), with 3.9 +/- 2.6 species isolated per subject. most prevalent were the anaerobes prevotella, eubacterium, and peptostreptococcus sp. and the aerobes viridans-group streptococci and streptococcus milleri group. any species  found in the blood was also isolated from the mouth, from 93% of the pericoronal  pockets and from 43% of the extraction sockets. surgical dental extraction clearly causes bacteremia of a high frequency and lasting longer than thus far assumed.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in fima regulation.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an important component of the complex plaque biofilm  that is a direct precursor of periodontal disease. the major fimbriae are required for attachment to oral surfaces and are an important virulence factor. fimbrillin (fima) expression in p. gingivalis is inhibited by surface molecule of streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque. in this study, differential display pcr was used to identify p. gingivalis genes that are regulated in response to s. cristatus. of several differentially expressed genes, pg2131 and pg2167 were upregulated by s. cristatus signaling molecules. a null mutant of pg2167 did not transcriptionally regulate fima following exposure to s. cristatus. in fact, fima transcription was enhanced in the pg2167 mutant, suggesting that pg2167 may act to repress fima expression. in contrast, a mutation in pg2131 did not affect transcription of fima in the presence of s. cristatus. however, production of fimbrillin was significantly diminished in the  pg2131 mutant, implicating involvement in posttranscriptional regulation in fimbriation. these data suggest that p. gingivalis fimbriation is controlled by more than one regulation mechanism, involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  == the in vitro activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). mic90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for actinomyces spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for prevotella spp. isolates of porphyromonas, prevotella and veillonella had the lowest mics and mbcs, and isolates of streptococcus, fusobacterium and lactobacillus had the highest. time kill studies with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s,  and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. these studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree  oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.

TI  == gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin: the role of 3 newer fluoroquinolones.
AB  == gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin are the newest fluoroquinolones and  show excellent in vitro activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract pathogens, many gram-negative aerobic organisms, and bacteroides fragilis. these  agents may be administered as oral and/or intravenous formulations with excellent bioavailability. the pharmacodynamics of these 3 new fluoroquinolones is more favorable than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for streptococcus pneumoniae. all 3 agents are approved for the treatment of acute exacerbation of  chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. in addition, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved for the treatment of sinusitis. the toxicity of these 3 agents appears to be similar to that of the other fluoroquinolones in terms of gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances. all 3 agents have a low risk of phototoxicity, but gemifloxacin is associated with an increased risk of skin rash that is not a photoreaction. these agents can be useful for treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams, but caution must be exercised to avoid the potential for selection of widespread resistance, which may occur with indiscriminate use.

TI  == coronal microleakage assessed by polymicrobial markers.
AB  == studies have shown significant bacterial leakage following exposure of sealed root canals to artificial and natural saliva. the objective of this study was to  determine contamination via bacterial migration in artificial saliva in endodontically treated teeth using different obturation techniques and sealers. a total of 144 extracted, human mandibular anterior teeth were cleaned and shaped to a #40 master apical file using hand and rotary instrumentation. one hundred and twenty teeth were divided into two experimental groups. the teeth in group 1  were obturated with gutta-percha using lateral compaction and five different sealers, and the teeth in group 2 were obturated with gutta-percha using thermomechanical compaction and five different sealers. the remaining 24 teeth were prepared as positive and negative controls. all specimens, except the negative controls, were inoculated every five days with anaerobic streptococci (nctc 9891) related to peptostreptococcus micros and prevotella intermedia (atcc  25611). the contamination onset time was continuously recorded and turbid broths  cultured for bacteria identification. the controls behaved as expected. regardless of the combination between obturation techniques and different sealers, all broths became turbid during this experiment. the correlation between the obturation techniques and the sealers revealed statistical significance using anova (p<0.0001), followed by the duncan multiple range test, which determined the ranking between these interactions. the combination of microseal obturation technique with ketac-endo sealer allowed a slower rate of coronal-apical bacterial migration.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == lethal photosensitization in microbiological treatment of ligature-induced peri-implantitis: a preliminary study in dogs.
AB  == this pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue o (tbo,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mw gaalas diode laser. the mean initial and final  bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 cfu/ml, respectively for tvc (p < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 cfu/ml for p. intermedia/nigrescens (p = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 cfu/ml for fusobacterium spp. (p = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 cfu/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (p = 0.0039). it may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.

TI  == microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == antibacterial activity of synthetic human b defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. human b defensin-2 (hbd-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or  stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. this peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. therefore, it is thought that hbd-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. however, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 was tested against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and escherichia coli. antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were  performed in vitro. the antibacterial activity of hbd-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. furthermore, the activity of  hbd-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. our results suggest the possibility that synthetic  hbd-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous s. sanguis could prevent, or reduce the  colonization of the virulent p. gingivalis strain. methods: first, 10 specific pathogen-free wistar rats were divided into 2 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days. successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis, isolated from one of the rats before doxycycline administration, and p. gingivalis 381 within 14 days of observation were demonstrated in the rats of each group respectively. then, 30 spf rats were divided into 6 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days to all the rats. afterwards, the rats in group a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis, the rats in group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, the rats in group  a were inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated for 5 days with p. gingivalis. the rats in group f served as negative  control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined after 12, 24, 36 hours, 7 days and 14 days. results: both pre-colonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis did reduce the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction only maintained quite short time, about 36 hours. it was not caused by  the decreased level of s. sanguis after 36 hours because the level of s. sanguis  kept stable during the observation period of 14 days. conclusion: that s. sanguis function as the effector strain requires the successful implantation of s. sanguis as well as s. sanguis producing antagonistic action efficiently in vivo.

AB  == objective: the purpose of the study was to identify the bacterial composition of  the microbiota from acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. study design: purulence from 17 patients with acute endodontic  abscesses/cellulitis was obtained by needle aspiration and processed under anaerobic conditions. bacteria were isolated and identified by biochemical or molecular methods. the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated bacteria was determined by using the etest. results: all 17 aspirates contained a mix of microorganisms. a total of 127 strains of bacteria were isolated. of 127 strains, 80 strains were anaerobes and 47 strains were aerobes. the mean number of strains per sample was 7.5 (range, 3 to 13). the average number of viable bacteria was 6.37 x 10(7) (range, 10(4) to 10(8)) colony-forming units/ml. strict anaerobes and microaerophiles were the dominant bacteria in 82% (14 of 17) of the cases. the genera of bacteria most frequently encountered were prevotella and streptococcus. prevotella and peptostreptococcus were frequently found to dominate the mixture. the combination of prevotella and streptococcus was found in 53% (9 of 17). the previously reported uncultured prevotella clone pus9.180 was frequently identified. the percentage of bacteria susceptible/intermediate for each antibiotic in this study was penicillin v, 81% (95 of 118); metronidazole, 88% (51 of 58); amoxicillin, 85% (100 of 118); amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, 100% (118 of 118); and clindamycin, 89% (105 of 118). conclusions: the present results confirm the existence of mixed infection with the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis.  the frequency of uncultured prevotella clone pus9.180 suggests the possible key role of this prevotella species in acute endodontic infections. penicillin v still possesses antimicrobial activity against the majority of bacteria isolated  from acute endodontic infections. however, if penicillin v therapy has failed to  be effective, the combination of penicillin v with metronidazole or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is recommended. switching to clindamycin is another good alternative.

TI  == evaluating biofilm growth of two oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the expediency of a microtitre assay system for establishing,  quantifying and antimicrobial testing of two representative oral pathogens. methods and results: streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used. morphological characteristics of the attached population were evaluated. biofilm  growth was evaluated spectrophotometrically (undisturbed and 1 n naoh dissipated  biofilm). the minimum concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate that inhibited biofilm growth was determined. growth of the biofilms was successfully monitored  by direct optical density measurements or those re-suspended in 1 n naoh. the latter was necessary when glucans were present in strep. mutans biofilms. the minimum concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate that inhibited biofilm growth was 1.25 microg ml(-1) for both species. the attached bacteria exhibited common biofilm characteristics. significance and impact of the study: the assay system developed was especially useful for monitoring the growth of adherent strep. mutans in the presence of glucans, which is particularly significant for the study of anti-plaque chemicals.

TI  == microbial/host interactions: mechanisms involved in host responses to microbial antigens.
AB  == the indigenous oral microflora and the host are normally in a state of equilibrium; however, the introduction of a pathogen can result in innate and adaptive immune responses that either contribute to the development of the disease or lead to host immunity. the interactions between the microorganisms and the host are very dynamic, thus allowing the complex interplay between host molecules and bacterial antigens. in this article, we focus on the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of and host responses to two oral pathogens: the gram-negative bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease, and the gram-positive streptococcus mutans, a primary agent  involved in dental caries formation. furthermore, we address mechanisms involved  in the ability of select adjuvants and delivery systems to potentiate mucosal and systemic immune responses to microbial vaccine antigens.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogens of orofacial odontogenic infections to 11 beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the current effectiveness of 11 beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections by determining the  antimicrobial susceptibility of the major pathogens. the antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans streptococci (n = 47), peptostreptococcus (n = 67),  porphyromonas (n = 18), fusobacterium (n = 57), black-pigmented prevotella (n = 59) and non-pigmented prevotella (n = 47) isolated from pus specimens of 93 orofacial odontogenic infections to penicillin g, cefmetazole, flomoxef, cefoperazone, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, cefoselis, imipenem and faropenem were determined using the agar dilution method. penicillin g, most cephalosporins, imipenem and faropenem worked well against viridans streptococci, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas and fusobacterium. penicillin g and most cephalosporins, including fourth-generation agents, were not effective against beta-lactamase-positive prevotella, though they were effective against beta-lactamase-negative strains. cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and faropenem expressed powerful antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-positive prevotella. in conclusion, penicillins have the potential to be first-line agents in the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections. most of the other beta-lactam antibiotics, including fourth-generation cephalosporins, were not found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins. in contrast, cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and  faropenem were found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins.

TI  == dental biofilms at healthy and inflamed gingival margins.
AB  == objectives: the increased plaque formation observed in gingival inflammation is not fully understood. receptor proteins in the dental pellicle might influence bacterial adhesion and subsequent plaque formation. the purpose of the present study was to examine proteins and microorganisms in dental biofilms, at healthy and inflamed gingival margins. material and methods: to see whether marginal inflammation affects the composition of the pellicle and the early dental plaque, samples were taken from the gingival and incisal parts of teeth in periodontally  healthy subjects, both in gingival health and during experimental gingivitis. pellicle proteins were analysed using gel-electrophoresis, immunoblotting and image analysis. bacteria were analysed by culturing and the pcr technique. results: during gingivitis, the rate of plaque formation increased significantly. the semiquantitative amounts of proteins and the numbers of bacteria varied considerably between individuals and surfaces. the amount of total and individual pellicle proteins and the total numbers of bacteria were, however, increased during gingivitis and the increase in proteins was statistically significant on the incisal parts of tooth surfaces. compared to a healthy gingiva, reduced numbers for actinomyces spp. (incisal parts only) and streptococci and increased  numbers of periodontopathogens in the 4 h dental biofilms were seen at the inflamed gingiva. conclusion: increased gingival crevicular fluid flow during gingivitis affects pellicle formation and increased plasma proteins in the pellicle may modify bacterial attachment and early dental plaque composition.

TI  == enhanced neutrophil emigration and porphyromonas gingivalis reduction following pgg-glucan treatment of mice.
AB  == periodontal disease is the consequence of a mixed gram-negative infection in the  gingival sulcus and has been associated with deficits in the neutrophil response. a novel, and heretofore untested, alternative approach to therapy is the use of biological-response modulators that enhance the neutrophil response. poly-beta1-6-glucotriosyl-beta1-3-glucopyranose glucan (pgg-glucan) is an immunomodulator, derived from yeast, which specifically enhances neutrophil priming, phagocytosis and bacterial killing while failing to induce inflammatory  cytokine expression. the hypothesis tested was that pgg-glucan could enhance host resistance to a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. chambers were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsolumbar region of c57bl/6j mice and allowed to heal for 14 days. pgg-glucan was administered subcutaneously to one-half of the animals and saline to the other half. in the first set of experiments the chambers were inoculated with p. gingivalis (a7436) at 4 x 10 (6), 4 x 10 (7), and 4 x 10 (8) colony-forming units (cfu). in the second set of  experiments the chambers were inoculated with 5 x 10 (8) cfu of either p. gingivalis or streptococcus sanguis, a gram-positive oral microbe that is not periodontopathic. chambers were sampled over the following 2 weeks. the results demonstrated that: (1). bacterial cfu and neutrophils increased with increasing bacterial inoculum (p<0.02); (2). bacterial cfu were lower in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.02); and (3). neutrophil counts were higher in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.01). these results indicate that pgg-glucan significantly enhances neutrophil emigration and bacterial killing, thus decreasing the bacterial infection in this model system.

TI  == [research on inhibition of sodium fluoride on five subgingival bacteria in vitro].
AB  == this in vitro study was aimed at observing inhibition action of fluoride on 5 common periodontal bacteria in subgingival microflora. the liquid media two-fold  dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibition concentration (mic)  of sodium fluoride (naf) to 9 strains of bacteria representing the main periodontopathic species(p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedius) and the periodontal beneficial species (s. sanguis) and 1 strain of s. sorbrinus. the results showed that all the bacteria were inhibited at different concentration of naf. the mic values ranged from 128 micrograms/ml for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, 256 micrograms/ml for s. sorbrinus, 1024 micrograms/ml for p. intermedius to 2048-4096 micrograms/ml for s. sanguis. the results suggest that naf can also be used as a periodontal anti-bacterium agent and those preparations containing about 1000 micrograms/ml fluoride can be used effectively against the periodontopathic bacteria without disturbing the local ecological balance.

TI  == 3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  == the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == role of the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein in the development of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. p. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the p. gingivalis major fimbrial fima protein and the  species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial mfa1 protein with the streptococcal sspb protein. this study examined the contribution of the mfa1-sspb interaction to p. gingivalis biofilm formation. p. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of s. gordonii dl1 but not on streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of sspb. an insertional inactivation  of the mfa1 gene in p. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in s. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that p. gingivalis biofilms formed on enterococcus faecalis strains expressing sspb or translational fusions  of sspb with spap (the non-adherent sspb homologue in s. mutans) containing the p. gingivalis adherence domain (sspb adherence region, bar) of sspb. in contrast, an isogenic ssp null mutant of s. gordonii dl1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to p. gingivalis fima at levels similar to  wild-type s. gordonii dl1. finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in bar resulted in sspb polypeptides that did not promote the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. these results suggest that the induction of p. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional sspb-minor fimbriae interactions.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse tissue by porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by a multitude of bacteria. persistent infection leads to generation of various inflammatory mediators, resulting in tissue destruction and osteoclastic resorption of the alveolar bone. this study describes a novel in vivo murine calvarial model to assess the effects of oral pathogens on the expression of three proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha] which are involved in bone resorption. we chose porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans as prototype oral pathogens. we also tested  the effects of streptococcus gordonii, an oral commensal supragingival microorganism, considered a non-pathogen. live bacteria were injected into subcutaneous tissue overlying the parietal bone of mice calvaria for 6 days. at the end of the experimental period, tissues overlying the calvaria were removed and analyzed for proinflammatory cytokine expression by northern blotting. cytokine mrna was not detected in the tissue over the calvaria of control animals. in contrast, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans elicited mrna expression of all three cytokines, tnfalpha being the highest (tnfalpha > > il-1beta > il-6). p. gingivalis was more potent than a. actinomycetemcomitans in  inducing cytokine expression. in contrast, s. gordonii induced only low levels of mrna for il-1beta and tnfalpha but no il-6 mrna induction. these results suggest  that oral microorganisms with access to host tissues elicit a battery of proinflammatory cytokines. there were clear differences in profiles and, interestingly, a commensal bacterium also stimulated bone resorptive cytokine expression in host tissues.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == the effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. this study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (cbd). twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector (fbc) during the insertion of two dental implants. in group  t a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group c sterile water was used. for both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular actinomyces  odontolyticus, clostridium bifermentans, prevotella intermedia, and propionibacterium propionicum. samples from group t (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (p < 0.001) than in group c (sterile water  mouthrinse). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of cbd.

AB  == indigenous micro-organisms in the oral cavity can cause two major diseases, dental caries and periodontal diseases. there is neither agreement nor consensus  as to the actual mechanisms of pathogenesis of the specific virulence factors of  these micro-organisms. the complexity of the bacterial community in dental plaque has made it difficult for the single bacterial agent of dental caries to be determined. however, there is considerable evidence that streptococcus mutans is  implicated as the primary causative organism of dental caries, and the cell-surface protein antigen (sa i/ii) as well as glucosyltransferases (gtfs) produced by s. mutans appear to be major colonization factors. various forms of periodontal diseases are closely associated with specific subgingival bacteria. porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as an important etiological agent of adult periodontitis. adherence of bacteria to host tissues is a prerequisite for  colonization and one of the important steps in the disease process. bacterial coaggregation factors and hemagglutinins likely play major roles in colonization  in the subgingival area. emerging evidence suggests that inhibition of these virulence factors may protect the host against caries and periodontal disease. active and passive immunization approaches have been developed for immunotherapy  of these diseases. recent advances in mucosal immunology and the introduction of  novel strategies for inducing mucosal immune responses now raise the possibility  that effective and safe vaccines can be constructed. in this regard, some successful results have been reported in animal experimental models. nevertheless, since the public at large might be skeptical about the seriousness  of oral diseases, immunotherapy must be carried out with absolute safety. for this goal to be achieved, the development of safe antibodies for passive immunization is significant and important. in this review, salient advances in passive immunization against caries and periodontal diseases are summarized, and  the biotechnological approaches for developing recombinant and human-type antibodies are introduced. furthermore, our own attempts to construct single-chain variable fragments (scfv) and human-type antibodies capable of neutralizing virulence factors are discussed.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == identification of 40-kda outer membrane protein as an aggregation factor of porphyromonas gingivalis to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, aggregates with other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus gordonii. we previously succeeded in gene cloning the 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp) from p. gingivalis. although recombinant (r) 40-kda omp itself did not show aggregation activity, the affinity-purified antibody against 40-kda romp inhibited the aggregation activity of p. gingivalis cells toward s. gordonii which is one of the first oral bacteria to colonize on tooth surfaces and can be expected to support subsequent colonization of other bacteria. in this study, in order to clarify the pathological role of 40-kda omp, we used a cross-linking reagent to construct a polymeric form of r40-kda omp and examined its aggregation activity. the polymeric r40-kda omp significantly expressed aggregation activity with s. gordonii cells. moreover, the antibody against r40-kda omp inhibited the aggregation activity of the polymeric r40-kda omp. these findings clearly demonstrate that 40-kda omp, as a multivalent form, is one of the important aggregation factors on the cell surface of p. gingivalis.

TI  == effect of the enamel matrix derivative emdogain on the growth of periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of emdogain (emd), used for periodontal regeneration, on the growth of periodontal pathogens like actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. for comparison, we studied the effect of emd on several microbes associated with other oral diseases as well as its effect on non-pathogenic oral  inhabitants. methods: freshly prepared emd or its vehicle propylene glycol alginate (pga) alone were added to calibrated suspensions of microbes. as a control, imitating the post-surgical subgingival situation after flap closure, a  serum/nacl-solution mixture was used. aliquots for growth assays were taken at scheduled times for calculation of colony-forming units and cell densities over an observation period of 24 h. additionally, emd was spotted onto selected, newly seeded microbes growing on agar plates to see if growth inhibition zones could be produced. results: the study revealed a marked inhibitory effect of emd on the growth of the gram-negative periodontal pathogens. a. actinomycetemcomitans showed a significant decrease (p=0.012) in viable counts after 24 h when emd was  added at baseline. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia also showed a marked growth reduction in the presence of emd and in these cultures no viable microbes could be detected anymore after 24 h. in contrast, no significant growth inhibition was observed in gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: the results suggest that emd has a positive effect on the composition of bacterial species in the post-surgical periodontal wound, by selectively restricting growth of periopathogens that could hamper the wound healing and reduce the outcome of regenerative procedures.

TI  == the microbiota of young children from tooth and tongue samples.
AB  == this study determined the frequency with which 38 microbial species were detected in 171 randomly selected children from 6 to 36 months of age. children were sampled and dental caries measured. oral samples were assayed by means of a checkerboard dna probe assay. the detection frequencies from tongue samples in children under 18 mos were: s. mutans 70%, s. sobrinus 72%, p. gingivalis 23%, b. forsythus 11%, and a. actinomycetemcomitans 30%, with similar detection frequencies in children over 18 mos. thus, s. mutans and the periodontal pathogens, p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, were detected even in the youngest subjects. species associated with caries included s. mutans (children ages 18-36  mos) and a. israelii (children ages < 18 mos), the latter species possibly reflecting increased plaque in children with caries. species detection from tooth and tongue samples was highly associated, with most species detected more frequently from tongue than from tooth samples in children under 18 mos, suggesting that the tongue was a potential microbial reservoir.

TI  == periapical lesion progression with controlled microbial inoculation in a type i diabetic mouse model.
AB  == uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may be a risk factor for the  development of large and/or debilitating periapical infections. the objectives of this investigation were to: (i) determine the effect of diabetes mellitus on the  pathogenesis of periapical lesions with or without specific bacterial inoculations at the exposure sites, and (ii) test the sensitivities of two microbiological techniques in detecting the persistence of the bacterial inoculum in exposed pulps of nonobese diabetic (nod) mice. periapical lesions were induced in first molars of 29 female nod mice and 31 balb/c controls. acute (1-2 wk) or chronic (5 wk) exposures were either inoculated with a mixture of facultative and anaerobic bacteria or exposed to oral flora without inoculations. after death the teeth in the chronic groups were analyzed for the presence of the inoculated bacteria by culturing and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s rdna. periapical lesion size was measured histomorphometrically and the interleukin-6 content was measured immunohistochemically. the mortality among nod mice with inoculated and sealed exposures was 83%, compared with 29% for balb/c mice. in the inoculated and uninoculated chronic nod mice groups, 38% of the animals versus none of the balb/c mice died. the chronic uninoculated nod mice lost significantly more weight at the time of death than controls. polymerase chain reaction was more sensitive than culturing in detecting the inoculated anaerobic  bacteria. in the animals that survived to the predetermined time periods, lesion  size and interleukin-6 content in nod and balb/c mice were not statistically different.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

TI  == lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b and their relation to the oral microflora in hyposalivation of different origins.
AB  == there are several reasons for hyposalivation, each affecting the salivary composition in different ways. the aim of this study was to analyze and compare lactoferrin, amylase and mucin muc5b in stimulated whole saliva collected from subjects with hyposalivation of different origins and to relate the results to the presence of some microbial species associated with oral disorders. albumin was determined as a marker of serum leakage. the characteristic feature for subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation was a large increase in lactoferrin, probably due to leakage through inflamed mucosal tissues, while it was a high albumin content for the group with primary sjogren's syndrome, probably due to disruption of the fragile mucosa. the saliva composition in subjects with hyposalivation of unknown origin or due to medicines was close to that in the healthy controls. all three hyposalivation groups tended to display a decrease in the concentrations of muc5b and amylase. none of the microbial species analyzed (streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus and enterics) correlated with concentration of muc5b in saliva. the rt group, having the highest concentration of lactoferrin, had the lowest median number of f. nucleatum and was the only group in which median number of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens was zero.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == association of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways with gingival epithelial cell responses to porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase pathways are key factors in host signaling events and can also play important roles in the internalization of pathogenic bacteria by host cells. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can efficiently invade human gingival epithelial cells (gecs). in this study, we examined the activation of map kinase pathways in gecs infected with p. gingivalis. c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) was activated after 5 min of infection  with p. gingivalis, whereas noninvasive streptococcus gordonii did not have a significant effect on jnk activation. in contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1/2 was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by p. gingivalis, but not by s. gordonii, after a 15-min exposure. nonmetabolically active p. gingivalis cells were unable to modulate map kinase activity. u0126, a specific inhibitor of mek1/2 (erk1/2 kinase), and toxin b, a specific inhibitor of rho family gtpases, had no effect on p. gingivalis invasion. genistein, a tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor, blocked uptake of p. gingivalis. the transcriptional regulator nf-kappab was not activated by p. gingivalis. these results suggest that p. gingivalis can selectively target components of the map kinase pathways.  erk1/2, while not involved in p. gingivalis invasion of gecs, may be downregulated by internalized p. gingivalis. activation of jnk is associated with the invasive process of p. gingivalis.

TI  == discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == for pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide, designated bar. however, it does not adhere to streptococcus mutans, which expresses spap, a highly conserved homolog of sspb. comparison of the predicted secondary structure of bar with the corresponding region of spap suggested that the substitution of asn for gly1182 and val for pro1185 in sspb may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in spap. a synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of sspb promoted avid adherence of p. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to bar in spap was inactive. substitution of gly1182 and pro1185 for asn1182 and val1185 in sspb by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an spap-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote p. gingivalis adherence. furthermore, enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of p. gingivalis cells. in contrast, p. gingivalis adhered efficiently to e. faecalis strains expressing intact sspb or sspb-spap chimeric proteins containing bar. these results suggest that a region of sspb consisting of 26 amino acids is  sufficient to mediate the adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii and that the  species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of sspb that is not conserved in spap.

AB  == aim: the bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. methodology: single-species biofilms of prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum and enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as a control. the antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells  were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. results: iodine and naocl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against p. micros and p. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. iodine and naocl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. however, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. none of the agents were effective against f. nucleatum after 15 min but naocl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. colloidal silver was generally ineffective. conclusions: the effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. naocl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. however the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.

AB  == aims: to develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: the method involves coating hydroxyapatite (hap) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. the sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. results from the two methods were in close agreement. streptococcus mitis-coated hap discs were immersed in a 3h-labelled fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14c-labelled p. gingivalis cell suspension.  the discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3h and 14c radioactivity. the number of fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. conclusion: the data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of p. gingivalis. significance and impact of the study: the present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.

AB  == caseinomacropeptide (cmp) is a heterogeneous c-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk kappa-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. we have demonstrated that cmp has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and against escherichia coli. cmp was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc), and each fraction was tested for activity against s. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. fractions were characterized by n-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. the active form of cmp was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated kappa-casein (residues 106 to 169) [kappa-casein(106--169)], which we have designated kappacin. endoproteinase glu-c was used to hydrolyze cmp, and the generated peptides were separated using rp-hplc and gel filtration-hplc and then tested for activity against s. mutans. the peptide ser(p)(149)kappa-casein-a(138--158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase glu-c digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide ser(p)(149)kappa-casein-a(138--158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart kappa-casein-a(138--158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. the synthetic ser(p)(149) kappa-casein-a(138--158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against s. mutans (mic, 59 microg/ml [26 microm]). the nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations  tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.

AB  == detection of periodontal or peri-implant sites exhibiting progressing disease or  those at risk of deterioration has proven difficult. pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type i collagen (ictp), a marker specific for bone degradation found in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), has been associated with both bone and attachment loss in periodontitis and may be useful for predicting disease activity. the aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the relationship between ictp levels and subgingival species around implants and teeth from 20 partially and 2 fully edentulous patients. gcf and plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal site of each implant and tooth. radioimmunoassay techniques were utilized to determine gcf ictp levels. plaque samples were analyzed utilizing checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. traditional clinical parameters were assessed. seventy-one implants and 370 teeth from 22 subjects were examined. ictp levels and subgingival plaque composition were not significantly different between implants and teeth. implant sites colonized by prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, and streptococcus gordonii exhibited odds ratios of 12.4, 9.3, 8.1, and 6.7, respectively of detecting ictp. these results suggest a relationship between elevated ictp levels at implant sites and some species associated with disease progression. longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether elevated ictp levels may predict the development of peri-implant bone loss.

TI  == inhibition of epithelial cell apoptosis by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is periodontal pathogen that is capable of invading gingival epithelial cells (gecs). apoptotic responses of primary cultures of gecs to p. gingivalis were investigated with a dna fragmentation elisa assay. p. gingivalis induced a transient increase in gec dna fragmentation; however, after  prolonged incubation gecs did not undergo apoptosis. furthermore, p. gingivalis blocked apoptosis in gecs following stimulation with camptothecin. immunoblotting of gecs with bcl-2 or bax antibodies showed that p. gingivalis up-regulated bcl-2 levels in gecs, whereas bax levels were transiently elevated and declined after 24 h stimulation. streptococcus gordonii did not affect levels of either molecule. rt-pcr demonstrated that induction of bcl-2 occurs at the transcriptional level. the results suggest that p. gingivalis can inhibit apoptosis in gecs by up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2. the prevention of host cell apoptosis may represent a strategy for p. gingivalis survival within invaded gecs.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine digluconate and hydrogen peroxide on porphyromonas gingivalis hemin binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobe, is one of the major causative agents of periodontal disease. in this study, the effects of chlorhexidine digluconate and hydrogen peroxide on the hemin binding of p. gingivalis and coaggregation of this bacterium with oral streptococci were examined. the pretreatment of p. gingivalis w50 and 381 with chlorhexidine digluconate and hydrogen peroxide increased the hemin binding of these bacteria. the hemin binding of p. gingivalis was increased by the subminimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of chlorhexidine digluconate. however, concentrations of hydrogen peroxide  below the mic had no effect on the hemin binding of p. gingivalis w50 and 381. coaggregation of p. gingivalis 381 with streptococcus oralis atcc 9811 and streptococcus gordonii dl1 was diminished by chlorhexidine digluconate. the coaggregation-inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent. hydrogen peroxide also showed inhibitory effects on the coaggregation of p. gingivalis 381 with s.  oralis 9811 and s. gordonii dl1 at concentrations below that used clinically. concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate below the mic inhibited coaggregation. however, concentrations of hydrogen peroxide below the mic were not effective in reducing the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with oral streptococci. these observations show that chlorhexidine digluconate and hydrogen peroxide could confer variable effects on p. gingivalis hemin binding and coaggregation of this bacterium with oral streptococci.

TI  == membranotropic effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan.
AB  == triclosan is a broad-spectrum hydrophobic antibacterial agent used in dermatological preparations and oral hygiene products. to gain further insight into the mode of action of triclosan we examined its effects on membranes by performing leakage titrations of different oral bacteria and studying its interaction with model membranes through the use of different biophysical techniques. there was negligible efflux of intracellular material from streptococcus sobrinus at the minimal inhibitory concentration of triclosan; whatever leakage did occur commenced only at much higher concentrations. in contrast, no leakage was observed at even the minimal bactericidal concentration  for porphyromonas gingivalis. triclosan decreased the onset temperature of the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-3-[phospho-rac-glycerol] membranes and was immiscible with these lipids in the fluid phase at concentrations greater than 5 mol%. steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements of different phospholipid/triclosan samples using 3-(p-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)-phenylpropionic acid were consistent with the calorimetric data. incorporation of increasing amounts of triclosan into 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (depe) vesicles induced the nonlamellar h(ii) hexagonal phase at low temperatures and new immiscible phases at temperatures below the main transition of depe. taking these results together  suggests that the antibacterial effects of triclosan are mediated at least in part through its membranotropic effects, resulting in destabilized structures which compromise the functional integrity of cell membranes without inducing cell lysis.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == investigation on interaction between streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous streptococcus can prevent or reduce the  colonization of the virulent porphyromonas gingivalis strain. methods: successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis 381 within  14 days was demonstrated in the study rats following administration of doxycycline for 7 days. thirty specific pathogen-free (spf) rats were divided into 6 groups. after administration of doxycycline for 7 days, groups a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis. group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, group a was inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated  for 5 days with p. gingivalis. group f served as a negative control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined at 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. results: both precolonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis reduced the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction was maintained for only 24 to 36 hours. the level of s. sanguis remained stable during the 14-days observation period. conclusion: s. sanguis to function as the  effector strain, the successful implantation of s. sanguis and the antagonistic action efficiently produced in vivo by s. sanguis is required.

TI  == oral immunization with recombinant streptococcus gordonii expressing porphyromonas gingivalis fima domains.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobe, is implicated in the etiology of adult periodontitis. p. gingivalis fimbriae are one of several critical surface virulence factors involved in both bacterial adherence and inflammation.  p. gingivalis fimbrillin (fima), the major subunit protein of fimbriae, is considered an important antigen for vaccine development against p. gingivalis-associated periodontitis. we have previously shown that biologically active domains of p. gingivalis fimbrillin can be expressed on the surface of the human commensal bacterium streptococcus gordonii. in this study, we examined the  effects of oral coimmunization of germfree rats with two s. gordonii recombinants expressing n (residues 55 to 145)- and c (residues 226 to 337)-terminal epitopes  of p. gingivalis fima to elicit fima-specific immune responses. the effectiveness of immunization in protecting against alveolar bone loss following p. gingivalis  infection was also evaluated. the results of this study show that the oral delivery of p. gingivalis fima epitopes via s. gordonii vectors resulted in the induction of fima-specific serum (immunoglobulin g [igg] and iga) and salivary (iga) antibody responses and that the immune responses were protective against subsequent p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss. these results support the potential usefulness of the s. gordonii vectors expressing p. gingivalis fimbrillin as a mucosal vaccine against adult periodontitis.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == altered antigenicity in periodontitis patients and decreased adhesion of porphyromonas gingivalis by environmental temperature stress.
AB  == periodontopathogenic bacteria survive various environmental changes during the progression of periodontal disease. alterations in metabolism and protein expression will have to take place to adapt their physiological functions to environmental stress. we examined the effects of an elevation of 2 degrees c in temperature on the adhesive ability and antigenicity of porphyromonas gingivalis. elevation of growth temperature of p. gingivalis from 37 degrees c to 39 degrees  c remarkably suppressed the expression of surface filamentous structures, such as fimbriae, as well as the adhesive capacities to salivary components and streptococcus oralis. sera of severe periodontitis patients revealed a marked increase in serological activity with 39 degrees c cells than with 37 degrees c cells. the alteration of protein profiles of bacterial surface components by temperature elevation was demonstrated by sds-page, and their western blot profiles were also different from those of cells grown at 37 degrees c. although  a uniform trend was not found in the altered patterns, sera from severe periodontitis patients detected more antigenic proteins in cells grown at 39 degrees c than 37 degrees c cells. these observations suggest that p. gingivalis  downregulates the expression of fimbriae and alters its adhesive capacity and antigenicity by the temperature stress that could occur during the disease progression.

TI  == studies on oral health in mentally retarded adults.
AB  == during the last decades, a new policy involving normalisation, integration, equality and deinstitutionalisation of mentally retarded (mr) individuals has been accepted in sweden. consequently, many institutions have been closed and an  increased number of people with mr are now integrated into the swedish community. the general aim of this thesis was to investigate if a greater degree of independence for mr adults influenced the prevalence of oral diseases. material and methods: the caries incidence and prevalence, number of remaining teeth, incidence of tooth mortality and interproximal bone loss were investigated in a group of mr adults, aged 21-40 years, all with protracted, regular preventive dental care. the studied variables were related to living arrangements and degree of mr, and were followed during 8.5 years (papers i, ii and vi). incidence and reasons for tooth mortality were studied during 10 years in institutionalised mr  individuals (paper iii). in connection with the closing-down of an institution for mr adults, the changes of oral hygiene habits, sucrose intake and oral microbiological flora were studied in the new integrated living (papers iv and v). results: less restrictive living arrangements and mild forms of mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence in persons with mr. after 8.5 years, the caries incidence had decreased in all subjects, but persons with mild mr and those who lived integrated still had a higher caries prevalence than other mr adults. with the exception of subjects with down syndrome, the interproximal bone loss during 8.5 years was similar or lower compared to normal swedish populations. institutionalised mr subjects had lost an average of 3.72 teeth during 10 years. periodontitis was the main reason for tooth mortality. persons who cooperated well with dental treatment and those who used neuroleptics lost fewer teeth during the 10-year period compared to other mr individuals. the proportion of subjects with high levels of mutans streptococci and subjects who showed growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens decreased after deinstitutionalisation, and less subjects consumed sucrose frequently. the oral hygiene routines, and the levels of lactobacilli, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not influenced by the change in living arrangements. a simplified saliva sampling method, involving licking directly on the bacteria culture, was developed to count lactobacilli in saliva when delivering whole saliva was impossible. conclusions: less restrictive living and a mild degree of  mr were correlated to a high caries prevalence. subjects with poor ability to cooperate with dental treatment and those with down syndrome have an obvious risk of deteriorated oral health. however, compared to normal swedish populations, the mr subjects studied in this thesis had, after several years of regular dental care, satisfactory oral health.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the retention of three species of pathogenic microorganisms by three different types of toothbrush.
AB  == the retention and survival of microorganisms on toothbrushes pose a threat of recontamination for certain patients at risk. in order to measure the influence of brush design and optimize the choice of toothbrush model for complementary studies, the in vitro retention of three microbial species (porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and candida albicans atcc  26555) was evaluated for three types of toothbrush. two series of standardized experiments were carried out for each brush and microorganism. the first series tested the retention of the microorganisms on the head portion of the brush, while the second measured retention on the head of the brush and the part of the  handle inserted in the mouth during brushing. for each series, the microorganisms were counted at t0 and t24 (after storage of the brushes at room temperature for  24 h). depending on the microorganism studied, from 0.2% to 2% of the initial inoculum was retained on the brush. the number detected increased with the size of the exposed area. after 24 h, p. gingivalis and s. mutans were found on only one type of brush. c. albicans survived on all three. these results confirm that  microorganisms can quickly colonize toothbrushes.

TI  == dental plaque formation.
AB  == dental plaque is a complex biofilm that accumulates on the hard tissues (teeth) in the oral cavity. although over 500 bacterial species comprise plaque, colonization follows a regimented pattern with adhesion of initial colonizers to  the enamel salivary pellicle followed by secondary colonization through interbacterial adhesion. a variety of adhesins and molecular interactions underlie these adhesive interactions and contribute to plaque development and ultimately to diseases such as caries and periodontal disease.

TI  == changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

TI  == identification of a porphyromonas gingivalis receptor for the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein.
AB  == colonization of the plaque biofilm by the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis  is favored by the presence of antecedent organisms such as streptococcus gordonii. coadhesion between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii can be mediated by the sspb protein of s. gordonii; however, the p. gingivalis cognate receptor for this protein has not been identified. in this study, we identified a surface protein of p. gingivalis that interacts with the sspb protein. coprecipitation between p. gingivalis outer membrane proteins and purified sspb protein demonstrated that a  100-kda p. gingivalis protein bound to sspb. the 100-kda protein also bound to an engineered strain of enterococcus faecalis that expresses the sspb protein on the cell surface. monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 100-kda protein inhibited the binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii in a dose-dependent manner up to 86%. amino acid sequencing of the 100-kda protein showed homology to a protein previously identified as the p. gingivalis minor fimbria. the minor fimbrial protein may exist as a complex with a hemagglutinin-like protein since the genes  encoding these proteins are adjacent on the chromosome and are cotranscribed. thus, the p. gingivalis receptor for s. gordonii sspb is a 100-kda protein that structurally may be a minor fimbria-protein complex and functionally effectuates  coadhesion.

TI  == bacteriologic features and antimicrobial susceptibility in isolates from orofacial odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to obtain information for an effective antimicrobial therapy against orofacial odontogenic infections; such information  was obtained from recent bacteriologic features and antimicrobial susceptibility  data. study design: the bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogens in 163 patients with orofacial odontogenic infections to 7 antibiotics  was examined. results: mixed infection of strict anaerobes with facultative anaerobes (especially viridans streptococci) was observed most often in dentoalveolar infections, periodontitis, and pericoronitis. penicillin (penicillin g) was effective against almost all pathogens, although it did not work well against beta-lactamase-positive prevotella. cefmetazole was effective against all test pathogens. erythromycin was ineffective against viridans streptococci and most fusobacterium. clindamycin exerted a strong antimicrobial activity on anaerobes. minocycline was effective against almost all the test pathogens. the antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin against viridans streptococci was not strong. conclusions: an antibiotic that carries out antimicrobial activity against both viridans streptococci and oral anaerobes should be suitable for treatment of dentoalveolar infection, periodontitis, and pericoronitis. penicillin remains effective as an antimicrobial against most major pathogens in orofacial odontogenic infections. cefmetazole, clindamycin, and minocycline may be effective against most pathogens, including penicillin-unsusceptible bacteria.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == antibody-targeted lethal photosensitization of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that porphyromonas gingivalis is susceptible to killing by toluidine blue o (tbo) when irradiated with light from a helium-neon (hene) laser. the aim of this study was to determine whether a tbo-antibody conjugate (ab-tbo) could be used to specifically target p. gingivalis to lethal photosensitization in the presence of streptococcus sanguis or human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). when a mixture of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis was exposed to 4 microg of tbo/ml and irradiated with hene laser light, there were 1.5- and 4.0-log(10)-unit reductions in the viable counts, respectively. in contrast, when tbo was conjugated with a murine monoclonal antibody against p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, the reductions in viable counts of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis amounted to 5.0 and 0.1 log(10) units, respectively. lethal photosensitization of p. gingivalis in the presence of hgfs using unconjugated tbo resulted in a 0.7-log(10)-unit reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts and a 99% reduction in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine ([(3)h]tdr) by the hgfs. in contrast, when the ab-tbo conjugate was used, there was a 100% reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts but no significant reduction in the incorporation  of [(3)h]tdr by hgfs. these results demonstrate that specific targeting of p. gingivalis can be achieved using tbo conjugated to a monoclonal antibody raised against a cell surface component of this organism.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice have reduced bone destruction following mixed anaerobic infection.
AB  == c3h/hej mice have an impaired ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) due  to a mutation in the gene that encodes toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4). the effect of tlr4 deficiency on host responses to endodontic infections is unknown. in the present study, we compared periapical bone destruction, sepsis, and inflammatory  cytokine production in lps-hyporesponsive c3h/hej and wild-type control c3h/heouj mice. the mandibular first molars of both strains were subjected to pulpal exposure and infection with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. at sacrifice on day 21, tlr4-deficient c3h/hej mice had significantly reduced periapical bone destruction compared to wild-type c3h/heouj mice (p < 0.001). the decreased bone destruction in c3h/hej correlated  with reduced expression of the bone resorptive cytokines interleukin 1alpha (il-1alpha) (p < 0.01) and il-1beta (p < 0.05) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine il-12 (p < 0.05). no significant differences were seen in the levels of  gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), or il-10 between the two strains. the expression of il-1alpha, il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-10, and il-12 were all significantly reduced in vitro in macrophages from both tlr4-deficient c3h/hej and c57bl/10scncr strains, compared to wild-type controls. notably, the responses of tlr4-deficient macrophages to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were similarly reduced. neither c3h/hej nor c3h/heouj mice exhibited orofacial abscess development or infection dissemination as determined by splenomegaly or cachexia. we conclude that intact tlr function mediates increased proinflammatory responses and bone destruction in response to mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.

AB  == background: with an increasing body of data suggesting an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, studies have been conducted to elucidate potential mechanisms by which oral bacteria might exert systemic effects. 2 oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis, have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. this study was conducted to determine the effect of treatment with an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine  antiseptic) on the platelet-aggregating activity of these organisms. method: bacteria were grown under standard culture conditions. s. sanguis atcc strain 10556 was exposed for 3 min to the essential oil mouthrinse at either full strength or a 1:1 dilution, while p. gingivalis fdc strain 381 was exposed to the essential oil mouthrinse at a 1:10 dilution. positive control cells were treated  with hanks balanced salt solution (hbss). aggregation was measured using a recording platelet aggregometer. the assay of each organism in its respective mouthrinse dilution(s) or hbss was repeated 5 times. results: in all cases, the hbss-treated organisms induced platelet aggregation, with mean(+/-s.e.) lag times of 12.30 (+/-1.36) min and 11.36 (+/-0.58) min for p. gingivalis and s. sanguis,  respectively. in contrast, treatment with the essential oil mouthrinse completely inhibited the platelet aggregating activity of p. gingivalis and of s. sanguis exposed to the 1:1 mouthrinse dilution in all assays; the aggregating activity of s. sanguis treated with full-strength mouthrinse was completely inhibited in 4 of 5 assays, and inhibited by 75% in the 5th, for a mean inhibition of 95 +/- 1.5%.  conclusion: this study provides additional evidence that the essential oil mouthrinse can interfere with bacterial cell surface-associated activities which  may have clinical relevance.

TI  == large-scale synthesis and functional elements for the antimicrobial activity of defensins.
AB  == human neutrophil defensins, and their analogues incorporating anionic, hydrophobic or cationic residues at the n- and c-termini, were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. the synthetic defensins were examined for their microbicidal activity against candida albicans, two gram-negative bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) and two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans). the human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp1) and hnp2 were found to be potent candidacidal agents. hnp3, which differs by one amino acid at the n-terminus of its sequence,  was totally inactive. the gram-negative bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p.  gingivalis and the gram-positive bacteria s. gordonii and s. mutans were insensitive to human defensins. however, the insertion of two basic residues, such as arginine, at both the n-terminus and the c-terminus of hnp2 significantly enhanced antifungal and antibacterial activity. the addition of anionic residues, such as aspartic acid, at the n- and c-termini rendered the molecule totally inactive. the presence of two hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, at the n-terminus of hnp2 and of two basic arginine residues at its c-terminus resulted  in molecules that were optimally active against these oral pathogens. the results suggest that the n- and c-terminal residues in defensin peptides are the crucial  functional elements that determine their microbicidal potency. the three-dimensional structure of all defensins constitutes the same amphiphilic beta-sheet structure, with the polar face formed by the n- and c-terminal residues playing an important role in defining microbicidal potency and the antimicrobial spectrum. the enhanced microbicidal activity observed for defensin  peptides with two basic residues at both the n- and c-termini could be due to optimization of the amphiphilicity of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial membranes.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

AB  == cell wall-anchored polypeptides of the antigen i/ii family are produced by many species of oral streptococci. these proteins mediate adhesion of streptococci to  salivary glycoproteins and to other oral microorganisms and promote binding of cells to collagen type i and invasion of dentinal tubules. since infections of the root canal system have a mixed anaerobic bacterial etiology, we investigated  the hypothesis that coadhesion of anaerobic bacteria with streptococci may facilitate invasive endodontic disease. porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 cells were able to invade dentinal tubules when cocultured with streptococcus gordonii  dl1 (challis) but not when cocultured with streptococcus mutans ng8. an isogenic  noninvasive mutant of s. gordonii, with production of sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides abrogated, was deficient in binding to collagen and had a 40% reduced ability to support adhesion of p. gingivalis. heterologous expression of the s. mutans spap (antigen i/ii) protein in this mutant restored collagen binding and tubule invasion but not adhesion to p. gingivalis or the ability to promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. an isogenic afimbrial mutant of p. gingivalis had 50% reduced binding to s. gordonii cells but was unaffected in the ability to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii wild-type cells. expression of the s. gordonii sspa or sspb polypeptide on the surface of lactococcus lactis  cells endowed these bacteria with the abilities to bind p. gingivalis, penetrate  dentinal tubules, and promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. the results demonstrate that collagen-binding and p. gingivalis-binding properties of antigen i/ii polypeptides are discrete functions. specificity of antigen i/ii polypeptide recognition accounts for the ability of p. gingivalis to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii but not with s. mutans. this provides evidence that the  specificity of interbacterial coadhesion may influence directly the etiology of pulpal and periapical diseases.

TI  == synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == effects of mutans streptococci, actinomyces species and porphyromonas gingivalis  on collagen degradation.
AB  == background: while streptococcus mutans and actinomyces spp are considered to be major pathogenic microorganisms of root caries, their roles in the degradation of organic matrix components of human root dentin need clarification. methods: ten laboratory strains and 11 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and actinomyces species, and positive bacterial or purified enzyme controls (porphyromonas gingivalis whole cell lysates, trypsin or clostridial collagenase) were used to establish the degradation of azocollagen (ac), insoluble type i collagen (ic) or human dentin collagen (dc) from dentin powder in two types of experiments investigating collagenolytic activity either during or after bacterial growth. ultraviolet-irradiated dentin powder and gamma-irradiated ic were used to assess the collagenolytic activity of test strains during bacterial  growth. ac, ic and acid-treated dentin powder were used to determine the collagenolytic activity of sonicated bacterial whole cells and cell-free culture  supernatants recovered from test strains after growth. hydroxyproline or spectrophotometric assays were used to analyze the level of degraded collagen. results: data from this study showed that in contrast to the positive controls, none of the laboratory strains or clinical isolates elicited significant degradation of ac, ic or dc. conclusions: results indicated that mutans streptococci and actinomyces species had no significant collagenolytic activity,  but may be involved in the root caries process through other mechanisms. in addition, proteolytic enzymes from other oral bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis or from host cells such as neutrophils may also participate in the pathogenesis of root caries.

TI  == oral microflora in subjects with reduced salivary secretion.
AB  == it is generally assumed that a decreased salivary secretion rate will promote plaque accumulation and increase the risk for caries, gingival inflammation, and  mucosal infections. in this study, the effect of hyposalivation on the oral microflora was examined. the following micro-organisms were analyzed in rinsing samples from 14 subjects with hyposalivation: the total number of anaerobically growing micro-organisms, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and enterics. the study group, age 53 +/- 7 years, had no history of radiation therapy and showed no signs of inflammation in their salivary glands on biopsy. all were dentate with a mean of 24 +/- 3 teeth. their salivary secretion rates were 0.03 +/- 0.02 ml/min  (unstimulated) and 0.84 +/- 0.65 ml/min (stimulated). the control group was matched to the hyposalivation group according to age, sex, and number of teeth. there was a significantly increased number of lactobacilli, and a tendency, not statistically significant and with large variations within the groups, toward a higher proportion of mutans streptococci and a lower proportion of alpha-hemolytic streptococci in the hyposalivation group. the presence of micro-organisms associated with gingival inflammation and mucosal infections was  comparable with that in the healthy controls. the results indicated that a low salivary secretion rate mainly promotes a flora associated with the development of caries.

TI  == secretion of functional salivary peptide by streptococcus gordonii which inhibits fimbria-mediated adhesion of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a putative periodontopathogen, can bind to human salivary components with its fimbriae. we have previously shown that fimbriae specifically bind to a peptide domain shared by a major salivary component, i.e., proline-rich (glyco)proteins (prps). the synthetic domain peptide prp-c (pprp-c)  significantly inhibits the fimbrial binding to prps. in this study, a recombinant strain of streptococcus gordonii secreting pprp-c was generated as a model of a possible approach to prevent the oral colonization by the pathogen. a duplicate dna fragment (prpc) encoding pprp-c was obtained by self-complementary annealing  of synthetic oligonucleotides. prpc was connected downstream to a promoter and a  gene encoding a signal peptide of streptococcus downei glucosyltransferase i in frame. the linked fragments were inserted into the plasmid pmnk-4 derived from pva838. the constructed plasmid was inserted to produce the transformant s. gordonii g9b, which then successfully secreted recombinant pprp-c (r-pprp-c) of the expected size. the concentrated bacterial culture supernatant containing r-pprp-c inhibited the binding of p. gingivalis cells and fimbriae to prp1 in a dose-dependent manner up to 72 and 77%, respectively. the r-pprp-c concentrate also inhibited the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with various streptococcal strains as effectively as synthetic pprp-c in a dose-dependent manner. collectively, pprp-c was found to be able to prevent p. gingivalis adherence to salivary receptor protein and plaque-forming bacteria. these results suggest that this recombination approach with a nonperiodontopathic bacterium may be suitable  for the therapeutic prevention of p. gingivalis adherence to the oral cavity.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of an essential oil and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse in vitro.
AB  == although laboratory studies are not necessarily predictive of clinical activity;  they can help to elucidate mechanisms underlying clinical activity when the latter has been established. in a recent clinical study, an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine antiseptic) was shown to be significantly more effective than an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse (meridol) in inhibiting supragingival plaque formation. this paper reports the results of laboratory studies comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of these 2 mouthrinses using a  kill kinetics assay and a plaque biofilm kill assay. in both assays, the essential oil mouthrinse was considerably more effective than the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse. these findings are consistent with the results of the clinical trial and may help to explain the observed differences in clinical activity.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == bacterium-dependent induction of cytokines in mononuclear cells and their pathologic consequences in vivo.
AB  == viridans streptococci are a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria that are normal inhabitants of the mouth. these organisms are thought to contribute significantly to the etiology of infective endocarditis, although recently they have been implicated in serious infections in other settings. another group of oral bacteria, gram-negative anaerobes, is associated with chronic dental infections, such as periodontal diseases or endodontic lesion formation. we evaluated the ability of the oral pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas endodontalis to induce a pathogenic response in vivo, with the goal of quantifying the inflammatory response in soft tissue by measuring leukocyte recruitment and hard tissues by measuring osteoclastogenesis. s. mutans induced a strong inflammatory response and was a potent inducer of osteoclast formation, while p. endodontalis was not. to further study the mechanisms by which p. endodontalis and s. mutans elicit significantly different levels of inflammatory  responses in vivo, we tested the capacity of each to induce production of cytokines by mononuclear cells in vitro. s. mutans stimulated high levels of interleukin-12 (il-12), gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), all of which are associated with inflammation, enhanced monocyte function, and generation of a th1 response. in contrast, p. endodontalis stimulated production of il-10 but not of tnf-alpha, il-12, or ifn-gamma. these results demonstrate that oral pathogens differ dramatically in their abilities to induce inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. moreover, there is a high degree of correlation between the cytokine profile induced by these bacteria in vitro and their pathogenic capacity in vivo.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. the 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and  3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. all sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. the samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. the elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding  implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. the antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. no correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. this study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger  neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.

TI  == oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  == candida albicans (ca), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces naeslundii (an), actinomyces odontolyticus (ao), porphyromona spp (p  spp), candida glabrata (cg), candida krusei (ck), and rhodotorula spp (r spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 ml homologous suspension for each strain under study. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. samples were sonicated, and the  supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. highest adhesion was found with ca, cg, ck, sa, and ss. a sufficient quantity of actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. results with p spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. replicate flasks with ss and ca were cultivated. membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control  pieces. a cavelike surface was observed. streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == in vitro activities of e1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == e1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. e1101 was the most active agent against s. agalactiae and e. coli.  since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. the results of this study  suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, e1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == semiquantitative bacteriology of closed odontogenic abscesses.
AB  == pus samples from twenty-three dentoalveolar abscesses were collected by needle aspiration and examined by direct inoculation technique using 6 different aerobic and anaerobic agar plates. for aerobic culture, sheep blood agar and chocolate agar (kyokuto pharmaceutical co., tokyo, japan) were used. for anaerobic culture, four different media, 1) brucella hk agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood and defibrillated sheep blood, 2) paramomycin-vancomycin brucella hk agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood, 3) phenylethyl alcohol brucella hk agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood, 4) bacteroides bile esculin agar (kyokuto pharmaceutical co., tokyo, japan) were prepared in an anaerobic jar prior to inoculation. the aerobic agar plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c, and the anaerobic plates at  least 48 h at 37 degrees c in anaerobic jars. from 23 closed odontogenic abscess  samples, a total of 112 bacterial strains were isolated; 81 strains (72.3%) were  strict anaerobes, and 31 strains (27.7%) were aerobes. the mean number of bacterial strains per positive sample was 4.86. oral streptococci, prevotella, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and veillonella were common isolates. the combination of oral streptococci and prevotella was found in 11 patients (47.8%), and that of prevotella and peptostreptococcus in 12 patients (52.2%). the present study demonstrated that closed odontogenic abscesses are polymicrobial infections by aerobes and anaerobes. application of a direct inoculation technique for bacterial culture made it possible to isolate more anaerobes than our commonly used technique using transport medium and to delineate the semiquantitative bacteriology of closed odontogenic abscess.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == periodontal status and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms in sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. rapid bacterial plaque accumulation occurs in sjogren's syndrome patients due to decreases in salivary flow rate. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome  and evaluate serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including  major periodontopathogens, compared to healthy controls. seventeen sjogren's syndrome patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque (pl), sulcular bleeding (sbi), periodontal index scores (pi), probing depths (pd), and total number of teeth were recorded. an elisa was used to determine the serum igg antibody level to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms. significantly higher pl, sbi, pd, and pi scores, as well as an increased number of lost teeth were observed in patients with sjogren's syndrome compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to streptococcus oralis were significantly lower in sjogren's syndrome patients than controls (p <0.0002). these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis compared to controls (p <0.006 to 0.0004). our findings indicate that sjogren's syndrome patients have established periodontal disease and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms previously identified as periodontopathogens in systemically healthy subjects. these results suggest that sjogren's syndrome may affect bacterial colonization in plaque and contribute to increased periodontal disease in this compromised population.

AB  == this in vitro study investigated the effect of long-term storage on the coronal leakage of a microbial marker on teeth root filled with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha and one of two sealers. sixty single-rooted teeth were prepared chemomechanically to a size 40 master apical file. the teeth were divided into two groups of 20 teeth each and obturated with gutta-percha using either apexit or tubliseal ewt sealer. the teeth were stored for 6 months in artificial saliva  and tested for leakage using a marker consisting of s. sanguis and p. intermedia. the teeth were checked for bacterial leakage daily for 90 days. all positive control teeth leaked after 24 h, while the negative control teeth remained uncontaminated throughout the test period. leakage reached the apex through the experimental teeth at the earliest at 17 days and at latest at 88 days. fifty percent and 70% of the specimens of the apexit and tubliseal ewt groups respectively showed leakage at 90 days. there was no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) between the two groups.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of controlled-release local delivery of minocycline on periodontitis in dogs.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of minocycline in a subgingival local delivery system as an adjunct to tooth scaling and root planing in dogs with periodontal disease. animals: nine 4- to 7-year-old beagles  with periodontitis. procedure: after scaling of teeth and root planing, 2 treatment and 1 or 2 control sites were selected for each dog: treated sites (n = 18) received minocycline hydrochloride periodontal formulation and control sites  (n = 12) received ointment base (no minocycline). gingival crevicular fluid was collected at a baseline (prior to treatment) and at week 4. clinical and microbiological effects were evaluated and compared among sites. results: in minocycline-treated sites, clinical indices were significantly decreased at week  4, compared with those at baseline. minocycline-treated sites were associated with a significant decrease in gingival crevicular fluid, probing depth, and bleeding on probing values, compared with those for control sites at week 4. compared with that for control sites, total bacteria count in periodontal pockets of minocycline-treated sites had an obvious tendency to decrease by week 4. proportions of porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp were significantly decreased at week 4, compared with proportions at control sites and with pretreatment (baseline) values. conclusions: when used as an adjunct to tooth scaling and root planing, minocycline periodontal formulation stimulated favorable clinical and antimicrobial responses.

TI  == microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a dna probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. more sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain  over the monitoring period. sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for  microbial analysis. twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). cultural studies identified bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and selenomonas noxia as  the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. a. naeslundii, campylobacter gracilis, and b. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant  species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). health-associated species (10 subjects) included streptococcus oralis, a. naeslundii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. dna probe data identified higher mean levels of b. forsythus and c. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including b. forsythus and c. rectus. the data suggest that b. forsythus c. rectus and s. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. the differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.

TI  == [bacteriological study of oral open abscesses].
AB  == although studies of bacteriology of closed oral abscesses have been extensively done, there are few studies on microorganisms involving open oral abscesses. we examined bacteriologically three open abscesses with precaution against bacterial contamination with oral normal flora and saliva, when sampling. the specimens were subjected to aerobic and anaerobic cultures within 2 hours after sampling. all three cases were infected with 5 to 14 species of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; streptococcus spp., prevotella intermedia and other prevotella spp. were predominant in all three cases. all six prevotella spp. isolated were beta-lactamase producers, being resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. these results emphasize the importance of prompt anaerobic culture for the bacteriological study of open oral abscess and the significance of nitrocefin test to detect beta-lactamase produced by oral isolates, especially prevotella spp.

AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == anti-bacterial action of onion (allium cepa l.) extracts against oral pathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the focus was on the antibacterial activity of onions. this study  researched the activities of onion extracts on streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, the main causal bacteria for dental caries, and porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, considered to be the main causal bacteria of adult periodontitis. the results showed that the onion extracts possess an effect on all test bacterial strains (s.mutans jc-2, s. sobrinus omz176, p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. intermedia atcc 25611), and the  effects were bactericidal against cultured and resting bacterial cells. the activity of the onion extracts was stable even after 48 hours in the culture medium. this result suggests that no decomposition or volatility of onion extracts occurred in the culture medium. the antibacterial activity of onion extracts was not markedly influenced by cysteine (10 mm) treatment. however, activity significantly decreased with alkali treatment. grated onion left to stand at 37 degrees c for 48 hours did not show antibacterial activity. also, activity of steam treated (100 degrees c, 10 min.) onion was not observed. using  avicel plate by thin layer chromatography with the solvent of n-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:3:1), the main component of the substance (the substance which develops color with ninhydrin) was observed at an rf value of about 0.9.

TI  == secretion of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptides by recombinant streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. a structural subunit of the p. gingivalis fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to promote adherence of the bacteria to host surfaces and also induce an immune response. biologically active domains of fimbrillin responsible for adherence or eliciting immune responses have been determined. in a previous study, we engineered the human oral commensal organism  streptococcus gordonii to express such biologically active domains on the surface of the bacteria as a vaccine delivery system. in this study we report an alternative approach of secreting fimbrillin polypeptide domains into the medium  by modification of the surface-expression system described earlier. such recombinant s. gordonii, in addition to being a source for antigen presentation to trigger a protective immune response, may have the added advantage of directly blocking the fimbriae-mediated adherence of p. gingivalis to the oral cavity following implantation. this approach can also be utilized for secreting other biologically important therapeutic molecules on mucosal surfaces for modulating local microenvironments.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus gordonii sspb domain that mediates adhesion to  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary pathogen in adult periodontitis, may establish itself in the oral cavity by adhering to early plaque bacteria such as  streptococcus gordonii. our previous studies (r. j. lamont et al., microbiology 140:867-872, 1994) suggested that this interaction is mediated by the sspb polypeptide, a member of the antigen i/ii family of streptococcal surface proteins. s. gordonii was recently shown to express a second ssp polypeptide (sspa) that resembles sspb and the structurally homologous antigen i/ii polypeptide (pac) of streptococcus mutans. to determine if all of these related antigen i/ii proteins interacted with p. gingivalis, sspa, sspb, and pac were tested for adhesion to p. gingivalis cells. both of the s. gordonii ssp proteins  bound labeled target cells, whereas the s. mutans pac polypeptide did not, suggesting that antigen i/ii-mediated binding of p. gingivalis by streptococci may be species specific. to investigate the molecular basis for this functional difference, the p. gingivalis binding domain of sspb was mapped. the binding properties of a family of truncated sspb polypeptides lacking c-terminal sequences were determined. in addition, the lack of binding activity exhibited by the pac protein was exploited to construct and analyze chimeric sspb-pac polypeptides. both approaches revealed that the region defined by residues 1167 to 1250 of sspb was essential for p. gingivalis binding. this region of sspa and  sspb is entirely conserved, consistent with the binding properties determined for these proteins. however, the corresponding region of pac differs in both the primary sequence and predicted secondary structure, suggesting that the overall structure of this domain may define its functional activity.

TI  == antimicrobial compounds from ceanothus americanus against oral pathogens.
AB  == during the search for antimicrobial compounds from higher plant sources, a methanol extract of ceanothus americanus demonstrated antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. through further bioassay-guided fractionation and purification, three triterpenes (ceanothic acid, 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid) and two flavonoids (maesopsin and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside) were identified. among these, ceanothetric acid and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside were  new compounds. ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid demonstrated growth inhibitory effect against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia with mics ranging from 42 to  625 micrograms ml-1. maesopsin, its glucoside, and 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid, were inactive below the concentration of 500 micrograms ml-1.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == pathogenicity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == environmental regulation of fimbrial gene expression in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae are an important virulence factor involved in attachment and invasion. fimbrillin, encoded by the fima gene, is the major subunit protein of the fimbriae. to elucidate the influence of environmental signals on the expression of the fima gene, a strain of p. gingivalis (designated ple) containing a chromosomal transcriptional fusion between a promoterless lacz  gene and the fima promoter region was constructed. promoter activity was assessed by measurement of beta-galactosidase activity of ple. an 11-fold increase in activity of fima promoter was found as growth temperature declined from 39 to 34  degrees c. promoter activity decreased by approximately 50% in response to hemin  limitation and upon culture on solid medium. in addition, the presence of serum or saliva in the growth medium decreased fima promoter activity by similar amounts. a correlation between fima promoter activity and phenotypic properties dependent upon fimbriae was established. p. gingivalis grown at 34 degrees c, compared to 39 degrees c, showed an increased ability to adhere to streptococcus  gordonii and to invade primary cultures of gingival epithelial cells. these studies indicate that expression of the p. gingivalis fima gene is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to several environmental conditions and that altered fima expression can also modulate the adherence and invasion abilities of p. gingivalis.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  == myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. there are three myeloperoxidase isoforms:  mpo i, mpo ii and mpo iii. we examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena and streptococcus sanguis. isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-a-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in mpo i and diminished in mpo iii. exceptionally, serum-opsonized a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests  based upon myeloperoxidase.

TI  == expression of functional porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptide domains  on the surface of streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == genetically engineering bacteria to express surface proteins which can antagonize the colonization of other microorganisms is a promising strategy for altering bacterial environments. the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a structural subunit  of the p. gingivalis fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to be an important virulence factor, which likely promotes adherence of the bacterium to saliva-coated oral surfaces and induces host responses. immunization of gnotobiotic rats with synthetic peptides based on the predicted amino acid sequence of fimbrillin has also been shown to elicit a specific immune response and protection against p. gingivalis-associated periodontal destruction. in this  study we engineered the human oral commensal organism streptococcus gordonii to surface express subdomains of the fimbrillin polypeptide fused to the anchor region of streptococcal m6 protein. the resulting recombinant s. gordonii strains expressing p. gingivalis fimbrillin bound saliva-coated hydroxyapatite in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited binding of p. gingivalis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. moreover, the recombinant s. gordonii strains were  capable of eliciting a p. gingivalis fimbrillin-specific immune response in rabbits. these results show that functional and immunologically reactive p. gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptides can be expressed on the surface of s. gordonii. the recombinant fimbrillin-expressing s. gordonii strains may provide an effective vaccine or a vehicle for replacement therapy against p. gingivalis.  these experiments demonstrated the feasibility of expressing biologically active  agents (antigens or adhesin molecules) by genetically engineered streptococci. such genetically engineered organisms can be utilized to modulate the microenvironment of the oral cavity.

AB  == chemokines are a family of low-molecular-weight proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. chemokine expression contributes to the presence of different leukocyte populations observed in normal and pathologic states. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were stimulated by microbes (candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) selected based upon their importance as oral pathogens. il-8 and mcp-1 gene expression and protein release were determined by northern blot (rna blot) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. c. albicans, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans induced high levels of production of both mcp-1 and il-8. s. mutans was a strong inducer of mcp-1, but it did not stimulate significant production of il-8. c. albicans, s. mutans, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 500 to 5,000 times more potent than p. gingivalis in terms of mcp-1 production. in general, the microbe-to-pbmc ratios required for maximum gene expression of mcp-1 were lower than those for il-8. however, for actual protein release of mcp-1 versus il-8, differences in the effects of various microbe concentrations were observed only for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results demonstrate that different oral pathogens induce specific dose-dependent patterns of chemokine gene expression and release. such patterns may help explain the immunopathology of oral infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == the inhibitory action of fatty acids on oral bacteria.
AB  == saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives were examined for their growth-inhibitory effects towards three selected oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas artemidis, and streptococcus sobrinus. of the 45 compounds surveyed, only one, myristoleic acid, was inhibitory towards s.  artemidis at a concentration < 100 micrograms/ml. cis-hexadecenoic and cis-octadecenoic acids were generally inhibitory towards p. gingivalis and s. sobrinus, but there was no correlation between the position of the double bond and the minimum inhibitory concentration. supra-minimum inhibitory concentrations of palmitoleic acid did not promote leakage of intracellular materials from either p. gingivalis or s. sobrinus, nor was l-isoleucine uptake by s. sobrinus inhibited. fatty acids and derivatives were also examined for prospective synergistic or antagonistic interactions with thymol vis-a-vis growth inhibition  of the test strains. lauric acid and myristic acid each behaved synergistically with thymol to inhibit the growth of at least one test strain, whereas cis-10-heptadecenoic acid and thymol were noticeably antagonistic towards the growth of s. sobrinus.

AB  == the effect of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of candida albicans and c. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. the filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the bec which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for  45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. the bec with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of c. albicans to bec; s. sanguis had no effect. both s. sanguis and s. salivarius suppressed adhesion of c. krusei to bec pre-exposed to three different bacterial  concentrations, although variable results were obtained with p. gingivalis and e. coli. significant differences in the relative adhesion of c. albicans and c. krusei to bec were also recorded. these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to bec is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the bec.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

TI  == effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  == although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse  (listerine antiseptic, warner-lambert co., morris plains, nj) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. these studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria.  these in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == the effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. an in vitro study.
AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == experimental model for porphyromonas gingivalis infection in animals.
AB  == a virulence model suitable for studying the dynamics of porphyromonas gingivalis  infection, including the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis in experimentally induced infections of multiple organs was developed using mouse and hamster. virulence of p. gingivalis strains was expressed contrastingly in subcutaneous (sc) infection  in the murine abscess model (mam) and the hamsters abscess model (ham). subcutaneous infection in the mam was characterized by a gravity abscess, spreading from the primary site of inoculation downwards, frequently erupting as  a secondary lesion. in contract, s.c. p. gingivalis infection in ham was characterized as a palpable localized abscess at the primary site of inoculation. when the semi-solid agar (ssa) was added to the mono-culture of p. gingivalis, reproducibility of infection in both models was enhanced. p. gingivalis culture supplemented with haemin, or combined with oral actinomyces viscosus had its virulence overtly enhanced and often fatal in the mam. menadione, eh reducing agents and mixture with the streptococcus or a. neaslundii did not potentiate virulence in either mode. transtracheal challenge of the lungs of hamster with p. gingivalis initiated an early pneumonitis and later sequelae of necrosis and abscess formation. also, abscess was induced by direct inoculation of p. gingivalis in the muscles, liver and testes, but did not induce intra-abdominal abscesses. in conclusion, the ham applied with the ssa procedure caused a localized p. gingivalis tissue infection with practical advantages for quantitative and qualitative studies of p. gingivalis infections. this study also demonstrates the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis by reproducing similar infections in multiple anatomical sites.

TI  == refractory periodontitis or recurrence of disease.
AB  == refractory periodontal disease is characterized by low plaque scores and low responsiveness to periodontal therapy. the patients often have a history of antibiotic therapy and therefore have a high incidence of resistance in the subgingival microflora. the above features are in contrast to adult chronic periodontal disease and recurrence of disease. the subgingival microflora of refractory disease may be either predominantly gram-positive with elevated levels of streptococcus intermedius or may be gram negative and contain elevated levels  of the classical periodontal pathogens. in some cases serum igg antibodies against porphyromonas gingivalis are elevated and seem to decrease after therapy. smoking may be an important factor in refractory periodontal disease. treatment with directed antibiotic therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing retards the progression of disease for a limited time. many questions are still not answered and suggestions are made for future directions in research.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota of a limited number of root caries lesions.
AB  == the microbiota of root caries lesions of different grades of severity were studied. fourteen lesions were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed correlation of histopathologically distinguishable stages with specific and distinct microbial populations. dentin samples were ground in a sterile mortar and cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, apizym, and api50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. in initial as well as in  advanced lesions gram-positive bacteria accounted for approximately 90% of the cfut. the proportion of actinomyces, and in particular a. naeslundii was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in initial lesions than in advanced lesions. in contrast, the percentage of streptococcus and especially s. mutans was higher (p  < 0.05) in advanced than in initial lesions. surprisingly low (0.8% of the cfut)  was the percentage of lactobacilli in advanced lesions. gram-negative bacteria formed a minor part of the microbiota in both initial and advanced lesions. among the gram-negative isolates, prevotella, selenomonas, and bacteroides spp. were most noticeable. in advanced lesions, only the outermost layer of 0.5 mm thickness was populated by a high number of bacteria; the following segments harbored a negligible number of bacteria only. it is concluded that root caries is a continuous destruction process which is restricted to a subsurface zone of limited depth. the necrotic dentin is successively worn away, leading to a saucer-shaped cavitation which is repopulated by plaque. the creation of cavitations favors an aciduric flora. this might explain the succession of bacterial populations observed during the destruction process.

TI  == endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. this has been associated with patency of  dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or  not. it was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. the significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.

AB  == several effects of thymol, a plant-derived antimicrobial agent, on porphyromonas  gingivalis, selenomonas artemidis and streptococcus sobrinus were examined. the extremely rapid efflux of intracellular constituents evoked by thymol is consistent with its postulated membranotropic effects. correlations between leakage-inducing concentrations of thymol and minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations suggest that membrane perforation is a principal mode of action of this substance. the thymol-induced decline in intracellular atp in s. sobrinus appears to be entirely attributable to leakage,  whereas in p. gingivalis thymol may also inhibit atp-generating pathways. relative changes in the transmembrane potential of resting cells of s. sobrinus pulsed with glucose are as sensitive to thymol as is leakage from this organism.  the effects of thymol on transmembrane potential are probably secondary to those  arising from leakage of intracellular substances.

TI  == endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. this has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: the experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. it was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

TI  == a 6-month home-usage trial of 0.1% and 0.2% delmopinol mouthwashes (ii). effects  on the plaque microflora.
AB  == the effects of 0.1% and 0.2% delmopinol mouthwashes on supragingival plaque flora were investigated in a 6-month home-use study. 141 subjects were studied from whom plaque was collected at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. overall, there were  no consistent effects on microscopic or total counts. however, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of dextran-producing streptococci in the  active groups compared to the control group throughout treatment. there was no colonisation by candida or gram-negative aerobic bacilli in the active groups nor was there any decrease in susceptibility to delmopinol. delmopinol appears to mediate its anti-plaque effect without causing a major shift in bacterial populations, although dextran-producing bacteria appear to be affected, which may have relevance to this agent's mode of action.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == head and neck space infections in infants and children.
AB  == a retrospective study was performed in 117 children with head and neck space infections treated at the children's hospital of pittsburgh from january 1986 through june 1992. peritonsillar space infections were the most common (49%), followed by retropharyngeal (22%), submandibular (14%), buccal (11%), parapharyngeal (2%), and canine (2%) space infections. the most common pathogens  isolated (n = 78) were the aerobes beta-hemolytic streptococcus (18%) and staphylococcus aureus (18%), the anaerobes bacteroides melaninogenicus (17%) and  veillonella (14%), and the gram-negative organism haemophilus parainfluenzae (14%). beta-lactamase production by aerobic pathogens was detected in 22% of cultures. computed tomography scans (n = 16) were reviewed in blinded fashion and compared with operative findings. the sensitivity of computed tomography scan in  detecting the presence of an abscess vs. cellulitis was high (91%), whereas the specificity was rather low (60%). treatment of head and neck space infections in  children should consist of accurate physical diagnosis aided by imaging studies,  empiric antibiotic therapy that covers gram-negative and beta-lactamase--producing organisms as well as gram-positive organisms and anaerobes, and timely surgical intervention, when indicated.

TI  == immunopathological activities of extracellular products of streptococcus mitis, particularly a superantigenic fraction.
AB  == previously, we prepared extracellular products, fractions f-1 and f-2 of streptococcus mitis 108, an isolate from the tooth surface of an infant, and showed that f-1 exhibited inflammatory cytokine-inducing activities. in the present study, we present evidence that fraction f-2 induced human t-cell proliferation in the presence of irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and selectively activated t cells bearing v beta 2 and v beta 5.1 in the t-cell receptor. f-1, on the other hand, stimulated human gingival fibroblasts to support the t-cell proliferation in the same way as human gamma interferon or prevotella intermedia lipopolysaccharide (lps). fraction f-1 also primed gingival fibroblasts to support the production of interleukin-2 and gamma interferon by the t cells upon stimulation with f-2. human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with fraction f-1, like those stimulated by p. intermedia lps and human gamma interferon, exhibited human leukocyte antigen (hla)-dr mrna expression and cell surface hla-dr molecules as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. an anti-hla-dr monoclonal antibody inhibited t-cell proliferation in response to f-2, probably through inactivating the accessory function of hla-dr-bearing fibroblasts. t cells activated with f-2 in the presence of irradiated peripheral  blood mononuclear cells exhibited definite cytotoxic effects against fibroblasts  and squamous carcinoma cells originating from human oral tissues. these findings  are strongly suggestive of an association of extracellular products of viridans streptococci with pathogenesis of oral mucosal diseases, particularly those disorders in gingiva which are accompanied by heavy infiltration of t cells.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == three-year tooth loss among black and white older adults in north carolina.
AB  == the distribution and determinants of tooth loss in older adults are poorly defined, especially in blacks, who have been underrepresented in previous studies. this study investigated, epidemiologically, the distribution and predictors of tooth loss in elder blacks and whites by following a random sample  of older adults in north carolina for three years. it was hypothesized that blacks would be at greater risk of tooth loss and would have different risk factors for tooth loss. data from 263 blacks and 228 whites were collected by dental examinations and interviews conducted in the participants' homes. during the three-year follow-up, 53% of blacks and 29% of whites lost at least one tooth. blacks lost 13% of their remaining teeth compared with 4% for whites. logistic regression models showed that factors related to tooth loss for blacks were: more s. mutans in stimulated saliva, deeper periodontal pockets, more p. intermedia in subgingival plaque, high blood pressure, limited help from others,  and few symptoms of depression. for whites, significant factors were: more lactobacilli in stimulated saliva, history of current oral pain at baseline, more alcohol consumption, no history of past use of calcium or xerostomic medications, higher income, lower occupational prestige, and increased numbers of negative life events. this study showed that older blacks were at greater risk of tooth loss than older whites. for both races, factors such as oral bacteria, periodontal conditions, oral symptoms, and psychosocial and economic factors are  related to increased risk of tooth loss.

TI  == oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. in this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including  streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough bsa-coated ti surfaces. the smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for s. sanguis and a. viscosus. however, p. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with sem. cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both a. viscosus and p. gingivalis observed were associated with the ti surfaces. ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. the in vitro attachment system has  proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant  surfaces.

TI  == microbiological assessment of an improved stannous fluoride dentifrice.
AB  == recently, a new stabilized stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice (ssf) has been developed. the aim of the present work was to examine the antimicrobial activity  of snf2, and to assess the long-term microbial safety of this dentifrice in a series of in vitro and clinical evaluations. results of in vitro time-kill experiments with representative oral bacteria demonstrated that snf2 exerts broad antimicrobial activity against both gram-positives and gram-negatives and, in particular, has potent activity against streptococcus mutans. sixty-eight subjects participated in a nine-day plaque regrowth clinical study to assess the  short-term antiplaque effect of ssf. the results revealed no significant differences from the negative control, suggesting that snf2 does not detectably or directly alter plaque microbial viability or composition. separately, evaluation of microbial safety in a subgroup of 120 subjects participating in a six-month clinical efficacy and safety trial found no significant ecological shifts between ssf and the negative (naf dentifrice) control among 11 supragingival microbial populations examined. the potential for development of bacterial resistance to snf2 was assessed under both in vitro and clinical conditions. in a rigorous assessment of the ability of bacterial populations to develop either phenotypic or genotypic resistance to snf2, representative bacteria were exposed to continuous sub-lethal concentrations of snf2 in a laboratory chemostat for at least 9 days. results of time-kill experiments on exposed populations revealed no significant changes in susceptibility despite exposure of over 10(12) bacteria. based on typical spontaneous mutation rates of  10(-6) to 10(-8), these results suggested that the potential for bacteria to develop resistance to snf2 is low. evaluation of susceptibility to snf2 to over 800 bacterial isolates obtained over the course of the six-month clinical trial corroborate the in vitro findings, revealing no changes in susceptibility suggestive of development of resistance to snf2 is a microbiologically safe agent for oral use and support separate clinical observations demonstrating the safety  and efficacy of this stabilized snf2 dentifrice.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota in plaque covering sound, carious and arrested carious root surfaces.
AB  == the plaque microbiota covering sound or carious root surfaces were studied and compared with that covering arrested root caries lesions. from each of these categories five extracted teeth were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed us to relate the qualitative and quantitative microbial composition to the degree of integrity of the root surface. plaque was sampled by a newly developed 'mowing' technique. plaque samples were cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci of the mutans group. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, api zym, and api 50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. regardless of the state of mineralization, the microbiota on all surfaces resembled marginal plaque associated with gingivitis. in addition to the gram-positive predominant facultative anaerobic genera streptococcus, staphylococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces, gram-negative anaerobes, predominantly bacteroides, prevotella, selenomonas, fusobacterium, leptotrichia,  and capnocytophaga, showed the highest isolation frequencies. on all surfaces actinomyces spp. predominated, with streptococci and lactobacilli forming a minor part of the microbiota. with respect to the detected proportions of anaerobes, microaerophiles, actinomyces naeslundii, prevotella buccae and selenomonas dianae, significant differences were observed between the three categories of root surfaces. the total cfu's on both caries-free and caries-active surfaces were significantly higher than on arrested lesions. in general, the results support a polymicrobial etiology for caries initiation on root surfaces, with a.  naeslundii, capnocytophaga spp., and prevotella spp. making specific contributions to the processes of cementum and dentin breakdown.

AB  == fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis. in this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and p. gingivalis. however, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of s. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. labelled materials were recovered from the extract of p. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of nem but not in the absence of nem. in the binding experiment, p. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than s. oralis. these findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with s. oralis on the p. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.

AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == oral health status related to subgingival bacterial flora and sex hormones in saliva during pregnancy.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate oral health status in relation to subgingival microflora and sex hormone concentrations in saliva during pregnancy. oral health examinations were performed on 39 subjects: of 19 pregnant women (mean age 28.5), and 8 women in the fifth post-partum month (mean age 27.1), and  12 non-pregnant women (mean age 22.9). periodontal conditions of bleeding on probing, redness, swelling, and probing depth were examined. subgingival microbial compositions were examined with several selective media. concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in saliva were determined during pregnancy and the  first post-partum month. from the third to the fifth month of pregnancy, the number of gingival sites where probing caused bleeding increased concomitantly with increasing percentages of prevotella intermedia. the number of gingival sites with redness and swelling increased in the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy and decreased in the last month of pregnancy to the level of the second month. the gingival inflammatory signs, however, tended to increase in the first  post-partum month. the probing depth of gingiva gradually increased during pregnancy and the first post-partum month. percentage of p. intermedia increased  in the fourth month of pregnancy with increasing of hormones in saliva. the concentrations of hormones in saliva attained peaks in the ninth month of pregnancy. thereafter, proportion of p. intermedia decreased. as a further step,  these pregnant women were divided into three groups on the bases of percentages and detectable rates of p. intermedia. gingival inflammation was more extensive in the high group subjects in which more than 15% p. intermedia in total cfu was  detected; its severity also tended to increase.

AB  == an insertion sequence-like element, is1139, was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 chromosome. this insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. this is possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of is1161 from s. salivarius atcc 25975, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is30 from escherichia coli, and is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus. sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpa), revealed that is1139 is found in two strains of s. salivarius, atcc 25975 and atcc 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.

TI  == changes in root canal microbiota during the development of rat periapical lesions.
AB  == periapical lesions are reproducibly induced in rats by pulp exposure and infection from the oral cavity. lesions expand rapidly between day 7 and day 15-20 (active phase), with slowed expansion thereafter. in the present study we characterized the root canal microbiota present during the active phase of lesion development in this system. the mandibular first molars of sprague-dawley rats were exposed on day 0. the teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 10 animals) and 15 days (n = 10), and the microbiota present in roots was isolated and characterized. the number of colonies isolated per tooth was similar on day 7 (1.53 +/- 0.64 colony-forming units x 10(3)) and day 15 (1.49 +/- 0.37 colony-forming units x 10(3)). no colonies were isolated from unexposed control teeth. anaerobic bacteria increased significantly between day 7 (24.3 +/- 5.7%) and day 15 (47.3 +/- 7.5%), and the proportion of gram-negative organisms increased from day 7 (24.3 +/- 6.1) to day 15 (46.9 +/- 6.8). the predominant bacteria included, on day 7: streptococcus and bacteroides species; on day 15: species of streptococcus, bacteroides, prevotella, neisseria and peptostreptococcus. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus rattus, bacteroides pneumosintes and bacteroides ureolyticus were frequently isolated at both points. although approximately the same mean number of different species (approximately 3.5) was isolated per tooth on both day 7 and 15, the overall diversity of the isolates increased on day 15.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == bacteria invading periapical cementum.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms invade periapical cementum of human teeth from the adjacent periapical lesions. we therefore attempted to isolate microorganisms from periapical cementum through the adoption of standard anaerobic procedures for obligate anaerobes. samples of cementum were taken from 10 amputated tooth roots at the time of apicoectomy. from two of these samples, bacteria were recovered after anaerobic incubation, but no bacteria were recovered after aerobic incubation of the same samples. of a total of eight isolates from the cementum, seven were obligate anaerobes and one was aerotolerant. the obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to the genera prevotella, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, and fusobacterium. the aerotolerant  anaerobe was campylobacter. from this, we conclude that bacteria can successfully invade cementum via periapical periodontal tissue, and that such bacteria may play a significant role in chronic periapical pathosis.

TI  == molecules of streptococcus gordonii that bind to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as streptococcus gordonii. in this study, the molecules of s. gordonii g9b that mediate binding to p. gingivalis were investigated. biotinylated surface molecules of s. gordonii were extracted and mixed with p. gingivalis cells. interactive streptococcal components were identified by sds-page of the p. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. s. gordonii molecules of 45 kda and a doublet of 62/60 kda were observed to bind to p. gingivalis. polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kda proteins inhibited the  binding interaction. these antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kda molecules and the 45 kda protein. both molecules were also  antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of  170 kda which is antigenically related to the p1 antigen of s. mutans. cloning and expression in enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the p1-like molecule from s. gordonii m5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kda and 45 kda antigens and was capable of binding to p. gingivalis. these results suggest that  a p1-like molecule in s. gordonii is involved in adherence to p. gingivalis. processing of the p1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kda and 45 kda may be required for binding activity.

TI  == inactivation of the porphyromonas gingivalis fima gene blocks periodontal damage  in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == fimbrial production by porphyromonas gingivalis was inactivated by insertion-duplication mutagenesis, using the cloned gene for the p. gingivalis major fimbrial subunit protein, fima. by several criteria, this insertion mutation rendered p. gingivalis unable to produce fimbrilin or an intact fimbrial structure. a nonfimbriated mutant, dpg3, hemagglutinated sheep erythrocytes normally and was unimpaired in the ability to coaggregate with streptococcus gordonii g9b. the cell surface hydrophobicity of dpg3 was also unaffected by the  loss of fimbriae. however, dpg3 was significantly less able to bind to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than wild-type p. gingivalis 381. this suggested that p. gingivalis fimbriae are important for adherence of the organism to saliva-coated oral surfaces. further, dpg3 was significantly less able to cause periodontal bone loss in a gnotobiotic rat model of periodontal disease. these observations are consistent with other data suggesting that p. gingivalis fimbriae play an important role in the pathogenesis of human periodontal disease.

TI  == effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

TI  == bacteriology of dental infections.
AB  == the most common dental diseases, periodontal disease and dental caries, are chronic infections caused by bacteria of normal oral flora. when these bacteria increase in number and irritation exceeds the host defence threshold, disease arises. the human oral flora comprises more than 300 different bacteria. during the last decade approximately 10 species, mainly gram-negative anaerobes, have been noted as putative pathogens in periodontal disease. the gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic mutans streptococci are aetiologically the most important bacteria in dental caries. data have rapidly increased on the association of these bacteria with certain periodontal diseases or caries, on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and transmission among family members. chronic dental infections have been the focus of renewed interest because of recent advances in oral microbiology as well as in medicine. we now know that in addition to oral streptococci, recently classified, fastidious periodontal anaerobes can be detected from various extra-oral infections. oral bacteria may spread into the blood stream through ulcerated epithelium in diseased periodontal pockets and cause transient bacteraemias, which are regarded as increased risk, especially for immunocompromised patients or persons with endoprotheses. in these patients,  routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental care procedures. also the new association between dental infections and myocardial/cerebral infarction have offered new challenges for cooperation between dental and medical researchers.

AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to early plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus gordonii, is considered an important colonization mechanism. the molecules that mediate this interspecies binding have not been determined. fimbriae were prepared from p. gingivalis 33277 by mild agitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation and deae-sepharose chromatography. in a nitrocellulose blot adherence assay, purified fimbriae inhibited s. gordonii g9b-p. gingivalis 33277  binding by up to 54%. in addition, fimbriae bound to s. gordonii cells in a dot-blot assay. incubation of fimbriae with s. gordonii cells followed by washing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), electroblotting and probing with p. gingivalis antibodies also revealed that the  fimbriae bind to s. gordonii. in contrast, s. gordonii did not interact with fimbriae that were first subjected to sds-page and electroblotting or deposited on a nitrocellulose membrane, suggesting that conformational determinants of the  fimbriae may be important in binding. the results indicate that binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii is mediated, at least in part, by the porphyromonads' fimbriae.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp.

TI  == periodontal disease and dental caries in relation to primary igg subclass and other humoral immunodeficiencies.
AB  == 22 females and 3 males with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia (n = 6) or igg subclass deficiencies with (n = 3) or without (n = 16) concomitant iga deficiency were examined for periodontal disease and dental caries. only 1 patient showed more tooth loss than that found in the normal swedish population. 1 patient demonstrated advanced periodontal disease. no patient exhibited more severe dental caries than that of comparable normal swedes. microbiological samples from periodontal pockets and saliva showed recovery of potential periodontopathic and  cariogenic bacteria within normal ranges. this study could not support the notion that immunodeficient subjects exhibit an increased risk of developing periodontal disease or dental caries.

TI  == modulation of intergeneric adhesion of oral bacteria by human saliva.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis adheres in vitro to biofilms containing streptococcus and actinomyces species. on initial entry to the mouth, this interbacterial adhesion may enable p. gingivalis to colonize dental plaque and to avoid clearance by saliva flow. saliva may also interfere directly with p. gingivalis colonization of dental plaque; a 43-kda glycoprotein in human submandibular-sublingual saliva binds to p. gingivalis surfaces and diminishes interbacterial adhesion activity. to avoid fouling of its surface by host components, p. gingivalis produces surface-localized proteases that can degrade adsorbed proteins and may serve to unmask bacterial adhesins. successful management of p. gingivalis colonization might be achieved in the future by devising artificial methods to block its surface adhesins or to prevent bacterial proteolysis of native salivary molecules that have protective functions.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == the correlation between thermal sensitivity and the microorganisms present in 29  deep carious lesions was studied. the numbers of lactobacilli and total gram-positive rods in the carious lesions were found to be negatively related to  the length of pain triggered by cold and heat stimulants. the presence of gram-positive cocci and non-black-pigmented bacteroides were positively associated with both cold and heat sensitivities. black-pigmented bacteroides, streptococcus mutans, and total anaerobic colony counts were positively related to the heat sensitivity. recovery of fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces viscosus, and enterics on the selective plates was associated with cold sensitivity. total counts of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods on the anaerobic nonselective medium were positively related to the cold sensitivity. it appeared that teeth with low numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded to thermal tests with longer duration of pain. conversely, teeth with high numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded  with shorter duration of pain.

TI  == development and characterization of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific rat t-cell  clones.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen in periodontitis. to determine the role of t cells in the regulation of this disease, a method was developed for the generation and characterization of rat t-cell clones with antigen specificity to p. gingivalis whole cells. the clones studied so far demonstrated a t-helper (th) phenotype w3/13+, w3/25+, ox8- and ox22-. these t-cell clones proliferated in vitro in response to p. gingivalis, but not to other bacteria (prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, wolinella recta, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis). limiting dilution analysis showed w3/25+, ox8- t cells preferentially respond to p. gingivalis, rather than w3/25-, ox8+ t cells. p. gingivalis-reactive w3/25+ t cells belonged to the ox22- population, suggesting that the ox22- t cells may represent memory cells. all clones tested produced interferon gamma, but not interleukin 2. the cloned t-cell f1 significantly enhanced p. gingivalis-specific antibody production (p < 0.03). the availability  of these cloned t cells should bring new insight into the mechanism by which t cells regulate oral health and periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontal bone loss in porphyromonas gingivalis-infected specific pathogen-free rats after preinoculation with endogenous streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative bacteria dominate in periodontitis locations, while gram-positive bacteria characterize healthy sites. a well-established gram-positive flora might therefore inhibit the colonization of gram-negative pathogens. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine whether endogenous s. sanguis could prevent, or reduce, periodontal bone loss in rats infected with a virulent p. gingivalis strain. sixty specific pathogen-free wistar rats were divided into 6 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 2 weeks to the groups a, b, c, and d to suppress the preexisting microflora in the mouth. rats in groups a and c were subsequently inoculated with an s. sanguis strain, isolated from one of the rats, once a day for 5 d. infection with p. gingivalis 381 was then carried out for 5 d in groups  a, b, and e. group f was not treated with doxycycline nor infected with bacteria  and served as untreated control. six weeks after the p. gingivalis inoculation, the rats were killed. periodontal bone levels were assessed radiographically and  morphometrically, and serum antibody against p. gingivalis 381 was determined by  a fluorescence immunoassay. periodontal bone support, determined radiographically, was reduced in group b (doxycycline-treated, p. gingivalis-inoculated) compared with the other groups. in contrast, the morphometric determination showed no differences between the groups. in group b antibody levels against two different p. gingivalis 381 cell surface antigens were significantly elevated.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the clinical and microbiological effects of topical application of a metronidazole gel and a single session of subgingival scaling in the treatment of adult periodontitis. an open, randomized controlled clinical study design was employed. each of 24 subjects received the 2 treatments simultaneously each in 2 randomly selected quadrants of the dentition. the metronidazole, 25% gel was applied subgingivally on days 0 and 7. scaling was carried out in one quadrant on day 0 and in one quadrant on day 7. clinical and microbiological examinations were carried out before treatment and on days 21, 49, 91, 133, and 175 of the experimental period. the microbiological analyses included determination of total anaerobically cultivable bacteria, and relative proportions of anaerobes, aerobes, black-pigmented anaerobic gram negative rods,  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococci, and spirochetes. both treatments were effective in reducing probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing. metronidazole tended to be a little better than scaling during the study period and the clinical effects of both treatments persisted during the whole 6 months observation period. local metronidazole treatment induced a significant and long-lasting shift in the subgingival flora towards a composition more compatible with health and comparable to that obtained by mechanical debridement. proportions of black pigmented anaerobes including prevotella intermedia, and the number of spirochetes were significantly reduced after both treatments with a concomitant increase in the proportions of streptococci. while scaling resulted in a statistically significant increase in the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, this was avoided after metronidazole treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis adhesion to streptococcus gordonii by human submandibular-sublingual saliva.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis w50 adheres in vitro to biofilms of streptococcus gordonii g9b. this phenomenon is believed to facilitate the initial colonization  of the oral cavity by p. gingivalis and to contribute to the maturation of dental plaque. in this report, we describe the modulating effects of human submandibular-sublingual saliva (hsmsl) on this in vitro model of intergeneric bacterial adhesion (coaggregation). hsmsl inhibited p. gingivalis adhesion to s.  gordonii by 50% at a concentration of 57 micrograms of protein per ml. maximum inhibitory activity was associated with a 43-kda protein obtained by sequential sephadex g200 gel filtration and cm52 ion-exchange chromatography of hsmsl. pools of other column fractions of hsmsl showed no effect or were slightly stimulatory  for bacterial adhesion. the binding of radioiodinated column fractions containing the 43-kda protein by p. gingivalis was accompanied by their rapid enzymatic degradation. treating p. gingivalis at 60 degrees c for 30 min or with protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sodium iodoacetate) reduced adherence to streptococcal biofilms. these treatments did not prevent p. gingivalis from binding soluble hsmsl saliva components, although subsequent proteolysis was nearly eliminated. these observations indicate that surface-associated proteases of p. gingivalis, either independently or in concert with adjacent surface adhesins, interact with surfaces of oral streptococci to facilitate interbacterial adhesion. the adhesion-blocking properties of hsmsl, particularly the 43-kda protein, may represent an important host defense mechanism in the oral cavity.

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the microbiological efficacy of an adjunctive minocycline periodontal formulation delivered subgingivally. subjects  were systemically healthy but exhibited severe periodontitis; i.e., probing depths greater than 6 mm. the two study groups included individuals who received  minocycline or a placebo periodontal formulation after root planing. subgingival  plaque samples were obtained at baseline; prior to treatment; and at 1, 3, and 6  months. plaque was evaluated by darkfield microscopy and further analyzed for total dark-pigmented bacteroides species, p. intermedia, p. gingivalis and streptococcus, actinomyces, eikenella, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, and fusobacterium species using cultivable flora techniques. in addition, plaque was  evaluated for yeast on a selective agar medium. when compared to the placebo, the minocycline group had significantly lower proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months and lower proportions of motile rods at 3 months. furthermore, when compared to the placebo group, the minocycline patients had lower mean proportions of dark-pigmented bacteroides spp. and p. intermedia at 1 and 3 months as well as lower proportions of e. corrodens at 1 month. the minocycline group had significant decreases in proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months,  motile rods at 1 and 3 months, and increases in cocci at 1, 3, and 6 months when  compared to baseline. in the placebo group, root planing was also effective at decreasing spirochetes at 1, 3, and 6 months, but with significant differences seen only at 3 and 6 months. however, the degree of reduction in spirochete proportions was greater in the minocycline group when compared with the placebo group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == the use of dna probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  == immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (sf) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. in this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the  sf from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. two atcc strains of eubacterium were also included in this assay. specific antibodies to lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus (i), (ii), streptococcus mutans, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium brachy, and eubacterium alactolyticum in the sf from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. immunodiffusion assays of the sf revealed that igg was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. the presence of  natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.

TI  == predominant obligate anaerobes in human periodontal pockets.
AB  == this study was carried out to investigate the predominant anaerobic bacteria of periodontal pockets in patients with advanced periodontitis, who had no previous  treatment other than supragingival scaling, no history of recent or chronic systemic illness, nor any intake of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to bacteriological sampling. care was taken not to ignore tiny-colony-forming anaerobes, by means of a stereoscope and an anaerobic glove box system. out of 422 (100%) isolates, 380 (90%) were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that the environment in periodontal pockets was anaerobic and favors the growth of obligate anaerobes. among the 380 obligate anaerobes isolated, strains belonging  to eubacterium (54%) were predominant, and many of them occurred in tiny colonies. the other obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to wolinella (9%),  unidentified motile rods which resemble wolinella (7%), peptostreptococcus (6%),  fusobacterium (5%), bacteroides (2%; including those reclassified to prevotella and porphyromonas) and selenomonas (0.5%). among the isolates, 67% were gram-positive bacteria, including 59% of rods (mostly asaccharolytic eubacterium), suggesting that these bacteria, particularly strains of the eubacterium species, may play an important role in etiology of adult periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == microbiologic characterization of ligature-induced peri-implantitis in the microswine model.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiologic changes associated with induction of peri-implantitis in the microswine. a split-mouth design was utilized. three implants were placed in the edentulous mandibular bicuspid region of 2 microswine yielding 12 implants for evaluation. the experimental implant abutments were ligated with 4-0 silk suture material to induce peri-implantitis for a period of 45 days. the control implant abutments were not ligated. the control implants were scaled and cleaned at each time interval using plastic scalers. the attachment level (al), probing depth (pd), gingival index (gi), and  plaque index (pi) were measured at day 0 (baseline) and days 14 and 45. microbiologic samples were taken from the "sulcus" with paper points at each interval and were dispersed in prereduced media; plated on selective and non-selective media; and grown under aerobic, anaerobic, and capnophilic atmospheres. a greater al, increased pd, and higher gi and pi scores were noted among the experimental implants. the controls remained essentially unchanged. radiographs revealed that experimental implants showed an increased amount of bone loss when compared to control. bone loss caused the implant threads to be exposed in the experimental implants. microbiologic studies revealed that there was a shift from gram-positive facultative organisms to gram-negative obligate anaerobes, including black pigmented bacteroides, in experimental implants. the microbiota of the control implants remained primarily gram-positive facultative organisms. the microswine appears to be a suitable animal model for evaluation of osseointegrated implants. importantly, under the experimental conditions reported, osseointegrated implants were susceptible to "periodontal" breakdown or peri-implantitis.

TI  == effect of surgical and non-surgical periodontal treatment on periodontal status and subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate, on a short-term basis, the clinical and microbiological effects of a single course of scaling and root planing as compared with those obtained by flap surgery in patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis. 11 patients participated in the study. using a split-mouth design, one quadrant of the mouth was treated with reverse bevel flap surgery, whereas the contralateral one was subjected to a single course of scaling and root planing. 2 approximal sites on single-rooted teeth with a pocket depth greater than or equal to 5 mm were monitored clinically and microbiologically for 16 weeks after active treatment. both techniques resulted in a gain of probable attachment levels, a reduction in bleeding on probing and a reduced mean pocket depth, although 31.2% of the sites in the scaling and root planing group still had 6-7 mm deep pockets at 8 and 16 weeks after treatment. both techniques reduced median relative proportions and frequencies of detection  of black-pigmented bacteroides species. a highly statistically significant increase (p less than 0.01) in median proportions of oral streptococci was recorded only for surgery within the 1st month post-operatively. no correlation was found between residual pocket depth and any of the microbiological parameters considered in the study, suggesting that residual pocket depth does not exert a significant influence on bacterial subgingival recolonization after therapy. the  results from this study suggest that surgery can be as effective as scaling and root planing in favoring the establishment of micro-organisms compatible with periodontal health, although this effect is limited to the 1st month after therapy.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological characteristics of subjects with "refractory" periodontal disease.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between attachment loss and clinical, microbiological, and immunological parameters in a group of 21 human subjects exhibiting poor response to previous periodontal therapy. all had  been treated with periodontal surgery, tetracycline, and subsequent maintenance recalls to periodontists who, upon detection of disease progression, referred the subjects to our clinic. in our clinic, each subject received oral hygiene instruction and a thorough subgingival scaling and root planing utilizing as many appointments as necessary. clinical indices, including gingival index, bleeding on probing, suppuration, plaque index, pocket depth, and duplicate measurements of attachment level from an acrylic stent, were collected at monthly intervals. probing measurements were performed using the florida probe. when significant attachment loss (0.8-1.2 mm) was detected in at least 1 site, a bacterial sample  was taken from that site and from a comparably deep, but non-progressing, control site. microbial samples were enumerated by darkfield microscopy, on selective and non-selective media, and by predominant cultivable technique. blood samples were  also collected to determine antibody levels against potential pathogens. there was no difference in the amount of plaque present in sites gaining or losing attachment, but losing sites exhibited more bleeding and suppuration. 20 of the 21 subjects were tested; of these, 17 exhibited elevated serum antibody against one or more of the following microorganisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides, gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens. however, few, if any, of the "classical" pathogens were detected in the plaque samples obtained at the time progressive disease was diagnosed. the only exception was streptococcus intermedius, which occurred in slightly higher numbers in active sites.

TI  == effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  == surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. a polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. in all bacteria (b. gingivalis, streptococcus sobrinus, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells  adsorbed to the cathode. treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of  cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. moreover, in the case of  b. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. these findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of b. gingivalis was  dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, b. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == adherence of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis to streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  == intergeneric bacterial adherence is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to enable some extraneous bacteria to initially colonize the human oral cavity. some current evidence indicates that streptococcus sanguis, an early colonizer of teeth, enhances subsequent colonization by porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, a bacterium associated with advanced adult periodontitis. in this study, selected strains of  p. gingivalis and s. sanguis were tested for their adherence activities in vitro. a differential filtration assay was devised in which one member of the test pair  was radiolabeled. heterogeneous aggregates that formed in mixed suspensions were  collected on polycarbonate filters (8-microns pore size) and were washed free of  individual bacteria and small homologous clumps. p. gingivalis 381, w50, jkg7, and 33277 adhered to s. sanguis g9b, m5, challis 6, and 38. p. gingivalis a7a1-28 did not adhere well to s. sanguis under these conditions. more precise measurements of intergeneric adherence were obtained with an alternative assay with radiolabeled p. gingivalis and an artificial dental plaque composed of s. sanguis coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads. cnbr-agarose was selected as the supporting matrix for the plaque because it was uniformly and permanently coated with s. sanguis and because p. gingivalis had negligible adherence activity for streptococcus-free beads. p. gingivalis w50 grown to the early stationary phase adhered to s. sanguis-coated beads in higher numbers than  either midlogarithmic- or late-stationary-phase cells. intergeneric adherence was not inhibited or reversed by the presence of lactose or other monosaccharides or  disaccharides. pretreatment of either bacterium with trypsin or proteinase k reduced subsequent adherence by 86 to 100%. neuraminidase treatment of p. gingivalis caused 98% reduction of adherence, whereas similar treatment of s. sanguis caused only a 2% loss. preincubation of p. gingivalis at 60 degrees c for 30 min decreased subsequent adherence to s. sanguis-coated beads by 94%. adherence was reduced by 96% when bacteria were assayed while suspended in human  whole saliva or when pretreated with saliva and subsequently assayed in buffer. the concentration of whole human saliva required to inhibit 50% adherence in this assay was 23 micrograms per ml (1:200 dilution). suspension of the bacteria in normal rabbit serum resulted in 94% inhibition of adherence. these data indicate  that saliva and serum may be important host defense factors for controlling porphyromonas-streptococcus adherence.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == the models of infection in the rabbits mandible using streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis by the method of satoh-heimdahl were prepared. a penicillic  peroral antimicrobial agent, lenamipicillin (lapc), and pyridone carboxylic acid  peroral antimicrobial agent, tosufloxacin tosilate (tflx), were administered to infected and healthy groups. drug concentrations in the serum, pus, mandible, maxilla, humerus, sternum, costa, ilium, femur, tibia, liver, and kidney were determined by a biological method. the data were submitted to pharmacodynamic analysis and compared. the following results were obtained. the concentration of  lapc in the serum and various bone tissues was 1.2-6.4 times higher in the infected group than in the healthy group. the concentration of tflx in the serum  and bone tissues was 1.1-3.7 times higher in the infected group than in the healthy group. moreover, concentrations in the liver 1.1-fold and 2.1-fold higher in the infectious group than in the healthy group in the lapc and tflx administration groups, respectively, and 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold higher in the kidney in the lapc and tflx groups, respectively. both lapc and tflx diffused to  the pus more satisfactorily than to the serum. the cmax ratios of pus to infected serum were 1.48 and 1.81 for lapc and tflx, respectively, and the auc ratios of pus to infected serum were 1.31 and 1.62 in lapc and tflx, respectively. these results indicated that both lapc and tflx are distributed satisfactorily to the local foci in the mandible, and that their systemic diffusion exerted immediate clinical effects.

TI  == structure of a streptococcal adhesin carbohydrate receptor.
AB  == interactions between complementary protein and carbohydrate structures on different genera of human oral bacteria have been implicated in the formation of  dental plaque. the carbohydrate receptor on streptococcus sanguis h1 (one of the  primary colonizing species) that is specific for the adhesin on capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 (a secondary colonizer) has been isolated from the streptococcal cell wall, purified, and structurally characterized. the hexasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was purified by reverse-phase, amino-bonded silica, and gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography. earlier studies established that the repeating unit was a hexasaccharide composed of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose in the ration of 2:3:1, respectively. in the present study, determination of absolute configuration by gas chromatography of the trimethylsilyl (+)-2-butyl glycosides  revealed that the rhamnose residues were of the l configuration while the hexoses were all d. 252californium plasma desorption mass spectrometry of the native, the acetylated and the reduced and acetylated hexasaccharide determined that the molecular mass of the native hexasaccharide was 959, and that the 2 rhamnose residues were linked to each other at the nonreducing terminus of the linear molecule. methylation analysis revealed the positions of the glycosidic linkages  in the hexasaccharide and showed that a galactose residue was present at the reducing end. the structural characterization of the hexasaccharide was completed by one and two dimensional 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy. complete 1h and 13c assignments for each glycosyl residue were established by two-dimensional (1h,1h) correlation spectroscopy, homonuclear hartmann-hahn, and (13c,1h) correlation experiments. the configurations of the glycosidic linkages were inferred from the chemical shifts and coupling constants of the anomeric 1h and 13c resonances. the sequence of the glycosyl residues was determined by a heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment. these data show that the structure of the hexasaccharide  repeating unit derived from the cell wall polysaccharide of s. sanguis h1 is: alpha-l-rhap-(1----2)-alpha-l-rhap-(1----3)-alpha-d-galp- (1----3)-beta-d-galp-(1----4)-beta-d-glcp-(1----3)-alpha/beta-d-gal.

TI  == inhibitory effect of human plasma and saliva on co-aggregation between bacteroides gingivalis and streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the effect of human plasma and saliva on co-aggregation between bacteroides gingivalis and streptococcus mitis was studied by means of a turbidimetric assay. the co-aggregation activity was obtained from the maximum slope of the absorbance vs. time curve. its dependence on ph, temperature, and ionic strength was examined, and the number of bacteroides cells in relation to the number of streptococcus cells resulting in optimal co-aggregation was established. co-aggregation inhibition experiments showed that the co-aggregation activity was inhibited by l-arginine and l-lysine, although the activity was unaffected by the sugars tested. human plasma and saliva were able to inhibit the co-aggregation in a dose-dependent reaction. plasma exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity in these fluids. fibrinogen was the most potent inhibitor of the plasma-derived proteins tested. these data suggest the possibility that the oral fluids may modulate the attachment of b. gingivalis to gram-positive bacteria in periodontal pockets.

TI  == the formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  == the capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. a majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine. the most active bacteria were found in the genera peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, selenomonas, centipeda, bacteroides and fusobacterium. methyl mercaptan from l-methionine was  formed by some members of the genera fusobacterium, bacteroides, porphyromonas and eubacterium. when incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loescheii, porphyromonas endodontalis and porphyromonas gingivalis. p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. no other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of l-cysteine and l-methionine. these findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce  volatile sulfur compounds.

AB  == the activity of various antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, josamycin, doxycycline and metronidazole) was established in vitro using a rapid micromethod. the activity of these agents, which are widely used in oral medicine, was evaluated against microorganisms responsible for periodontitis and bucco-dental infections. their action against alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including pneumococci) which make up the majority of the indigenous oral flora was also tested. amoxicillin was found to be effective against all the strains tested. doxycycline was active  against periodontal bacteria, but not against 50% of the streptococcal flora. josamycin was found to be effective against streptococci, but appeared without effect on eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. metronidazole, inactive against streptococci, displayed greater activity towards  the strict anaerobes. the use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bucco-dental infections, especially periodontitis, is discussed. for periodontitis and periodontal suppurations, antimicrobial agents present a valuable adjunct to local treatments such as scaling or rootplaning. this may prevent more serious infections such as endocarditis that can develop after tooth extraction.

TI  == bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  == phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus. the results revealed that actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. the other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects  of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.

TI  == effect of tif4 solutions on bacterial growth in vitro and on tooth surfaces.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effect of tif4 as compared with equimolar solutions of naf, apf, and snf2 and to evaluate the effect, if any, on bacterial growth on topically treated tooth surfaces. in an in vitro study, paper discs impregnated with 20 microliters of equimolar solutions of snf2, naf, apf, and tif4 were placed on blood agar plates seeded with streptococcus mutans and bacteroides gingivalis. sterile saline was used as control. similar growth inhibition zones were found for all fluorides. in the second part of the study six volunteers carried intraoral appliances containing enamel and root surface specimens treated with 1% tif4 and untreated specimens for 18 h. scanning electron microscopic examination of the experimental tooth surfaces showed great variation in bacterial growth between subjects, but no systematic difference between fluoride-treated and untreated specimens. bacteria  from test and control specimens were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on blood agar and on mitis salivarius agar. colony-forming unit counts showed great interindividual variations, but no differences could be observed between treated and untreated enamel or root surfaces. thus, the hypothesis that the presence of a ti-rich coating may influence bacterial colonization on tif4-treated tooth surfaces could not be substantiated.

TI  == effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius.
AB  == the effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius was investigated. b. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a ph as low as 5.0. these bacteria grew almost as well as streptococcus mutans at ph 5.0 and  better than actinomyces viscosus at ph 5.5 and 5.0. some b. intermedius strains raised the culture ph when grown at a low ph without glucose. in contrast, p. gingivalis strains grew only at ph 6.5 to 7.0. the p. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the b. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. b. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at ph 7.0, and high activity over a wide ph range. in contrast, the optimum ph of proteolytic activity in p. gingivalis was ph 7.5 to 8.0. the p. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of b. intermedius to low ph. the capacity of b. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low ph might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. these differences between b. intermedius and p. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how b. intermedius might positively influence the growth of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.

TI  == [studies on plaque formed on implants].
AB  == in vivo plaque formation on implant materials was studied. when different implant materials were set on the gingiva, the number of adhering viable bacteria depended on material surface properties 4 hours after setting, but not 48 hours after setting. the formation of pellicle-like thin layers and subsequent covering by lamellarly formed plaque were observed on the surfaces of all materials. streptococcus species were predominant at the 4-hour setting time but anaerobes increased at the 48-hour setting time; this was common to all materials. the results indicate that surface properties of the implants influence early bacterial adherence, but do not influence bacterial flora or plaque maturation. the subgingival microflora at the neck of implants with clinically normal peri-implant tissues was compared with that at the neck of natural teeth. the bacterial isolates were classified based on their biochemical characteristics. for the spirochaetes, the number was counted directly under light microscopic observation. the most predominant bacterial species was streptococcus, followed by actinomyces, neisseria and then capnocytophaga at both sites. the ratio of spirochaetes in the microflora was extremely low for both the implant and natural tooth. such a bacterial distribution pattern closely resembled the hitherto-reported distribution of bacteria existing in a healthy gingival crevicular. this suggested that the microflora in plaque at the neck of a normal  implant is basically similar to that at the neck of a natural tooth. in conclusion, plaque formation on implant materials was not influenced by their surface properties in actual oral cavity.

TI  == selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells  and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a  model for study. bacteria studied included streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, actinomyces  species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and  bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis studied. in contrast, the number of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and a. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. treatment of  buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and a. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius were significantly increased. treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human pmns produced similar selective effects. the changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.

TI  == some aspects of protease production by a strain of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == our previous studies indicated that arginine (arg) plays a key nutritional role in streptococcus sanguis p4a7 and that this organism can grow on whole casein as  the sole nitrogen source. its protease activities were therefore studied after glucose-limited continuous culture in a chemically-defined medium with either free amino acids or casein as the nitrogen source. both culture supernatant and cell-associated endopeptidase (ep) and exopeptidase (amino-ap and carboxy-cp) activities were determined. growth rate (mu) had little effect on ep, 75% of which was consistently in culture supernatants; ap and cp both decreased as mu was increased and both were predominantly cell-associated. at high growth ph, ep  was substantially increased while ap and cp activities were optimal at ph 7. the  most striking nutritional effect occurred under nitrogen limitation (glucose excess) when ep and ap were greatly increased and cp greatly decreased. it was concluded that s. sanguis is well equipped to scavenge its environment for arg under a wide range of growth conditions.

AB  == the purpose of the present study is to produce a model of infections of oral cavity by inducing abscess in the mandibla of new zealand white rabbits as close  to the oral cavity infection site as possible in order to determine whether the administered antimicrobial agents will transfer to the localized inflammatory foci. the pus to be collected should be 0.5 to 1.0g or more to permit bioassay and it should be collectable under nearly uniform conditions at all times. new zealand white rabbit was the experimental animal used, in which anesthesia was induced intraperitoneally to expose the mandibula. a hole was made in the mandibula, into which a small cotton pellet inoculated with streptococcus milleri and bacteroides fragilis, whose cell concentrations had been adjusted to 10(8)cfu/ml, was implanted and the opening was carefully closed with sutures tightly. these two species of bacteria had been selected because mixtures of gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated in most cases from  the occluded abscess of oral cavity infections. as a result of the above procedure, it was found that one week after production of the infected model animal, the abscess contained adequate volume of, pus for collection and demonstrated viability of the two transplanted species of bacteria. this animal model was considered an ideal model for use in the studies on treatment of infections in the oral cavity by administering antimicrobial agents to determine  the extent of drug transfer into the pus and bones where purulent foci are present.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

TI  == the effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (igg) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  == the influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having  chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (cipd). the immunoglobulin g (igg) titers were determined by the microelisa technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, b. melaninogenicus, t. vincentii, and t. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. there was no consistent response to capnocytophaga. when individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. antibody levels to bacteria such as s. sanguis were modified during therapy. this would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.

TI  == assessment of the pathogenicity of bacterial species isolated from acute dentoalveolar abscesses.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 20 strains belonging to nine bacterial species isolated from acute dentoalveolar abscesses was assessed individually and in two species combinations by subcutaneous inoculation of mice. infections were produced by all the bacteria although variations were seen both in the type of lesion produced and the subsequent recovery of viable bacteria. anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were recovered more often (p less than 0.05) at high concentrations (10(6)-10(9)  cfu/ml) and produced a localised abscess with peripheral necrosis more frequently (p less than 0.001) than either streptococcus milleri or anaerobic gram-positive  cocci. lesions induced by a combination of bacteria comprising anaerobic gram-negative bacillus and any other species yielded both strains at high concentration more often (p less than 0.001) than a combination comprising anaerobic gram-positive cocci and s. milleri. it is concluded that anaerobic gram-negative bacilli are major pathogens in acute dentoalveolar abscesses.

TI  == use of percoll density gradients for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral  epithelial cells.
AB  == an assay for studying the attachment of bacteria to oral epithelial cells has been developed which utilizes percoll density gradient centrifugation to separate bacteria and epithelial cells. 3h-thymidine-labeled bacteria were incubated with  suspensions of buccal epithelial cells in microtitration plates for 2.5 hr at 35  degrees c. the mixtures were then subjected to density gradient centrifugation in 50% percoll. epithelial cells with attached bacteria formed a band near the top of the tube, while unattached bacteria formed a band near the bottom. the epithelial cells were collected on membrane filters, and the number of attached bacteria was determined by scintillation counting. binding of s. mitis c5 was found to increase with time, and equilibrium was attained within two hr. saturation of available binding sites occurred when 10(7) s. mitis cells were incubated with 1.5 x 10(4) buccal epithelial cells. the numbers of streptococci which attached as determined with this assay were in good agreement with values obtained by direct microscopic counts. adsorption of s. mitis c5 cells was adequately described by a langmuir isotherm (correlation coefficient 0.998). this permitted calculation of estimates of the number of binding sites and the affinity of the organism. the assay proved reliable even when as few as 1000 epithelial cells were used. treating the epithelial cells with neuraminidase or trypsin significantly decreased the number of s. mitis c5 cells which attached. in contrast, binding of a. naeslundii 12104 to neuraminidase-treated cells was increased, and attachment of b. gingivalis 381 was also enhanced, especially to epithelial cells which had been treated with trypsin.

TI  == intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the human oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. as the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until  at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. the ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of  human periodontal disease.

TI  == an in vitro model to study bacterial invasion of periodontal tissues.
AB  == in periodontal disease, the abilities of bacteria to adhere to and degrade in vivo basement membranes should be considered as two of the rate-limiting steps for the potential active or passive invasion of gingival connective tissues. to study these mechanisms in greater detail, we used the pf hr-9 basement-membrane-like matrix to establish an in vitro model of bacterial invasion and degradation. three gram-negative anaerobic periodontopathic organisms, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bound in considerably higher numbers to the hr-9 matrix than did 6 strains of gram-positive facultative organisms typically associated with periodontal health. in a further experiment with b. gingivalis, the organism rapidly degraded type iv collagen, the major macromolecular component constituting the hr-9 matrix. streptococcus mitis, the nonperiodontopathic bacterium tested, did not degrade this model matrix. this study provides evidence that b. gingivalis, a periodontopathic bacterium, is able to adhere to and degrade basement membranes, whereas nonperiodontopathic organisms appear not to share in these abilities.

AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response was examined in periodontitis patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm), impaired glucose tolerance (igt), and normal glucose tolerance (ngt). the predominant cultivable microflora was determined for subgingival plaque sampled from two deep periodontal pockets in each of eight adult periodontitis patients with niddm. indirect immunofluorescence for bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides  gingivalis, and haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans was used to examine these same  samples as well as 186 additional subgingival plaque samples from 47 patients with moderate to severe generalized periodontitis including 25 subjects with niddm, six subjects with igt, and 16 subjects with ngt. serum antibody levels to  13 microorganisms including seven oral bacterial species and one nonoral control  species were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa) in 377 subjects including 84 normal subjects without periodontal disease, 112 normal subjects with periodontitis, 19 periodontally normal subjects with igt, 65 periodontitis patients with igt, 15 periodontally normal subjects with niddm, and 82 periodontitis patients with niddm. three hundred eighty-two bacterial isolates were recovered from the eight patients. b. intermedius was the most frequently isolated microorganism constituting 16% of the total isolates followed by wolinella recta and b. gingivalis, which each accounted for 13% of the total. streptococcus sanguis was the most prevalent microorganism, which was found in 75% of the sites. subgingival plaque samples examined by immunofluorescence demonstrate a high prevalence of black-pigmented bacteroides and suggest that the proportion of b. gingivalis but not b. intermedius is higher in niddm with periodontitis than in other groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular  constituents of this matrix. radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from pf hr-9 cells. bacteroides gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum fn-2, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ga3(a) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of a. actinomycetemcomitans ga3(na) and suny  ab67 (range, 20 to 25%). the attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. the adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated  matrix proteins. the results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as b. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. on the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. the results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.

TI  == bacterial antigens induce collagenase and prostaglandin e2 synthesis in human gingival fibroblasts through a primary effect on circulating mononuclear cells.
AB  == our previous work suggests that one mechanism through which connective tissue breakdown might occur in periodontal diseases is the production of metalloproteinases, including collagenase, by gingival fibroblasts. in this study we investigated whether highly purified preparations of lipopolysaccharide (lps)  and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from a number of putative periodontal pathogens could induce monolayer cultures of human gingival fibroblasts to synthesize collagenase and prostaglandin e2. using both biochemical assays and immunocytochemical techniques, we found that cells synthesized only very small amounts of collagenase in direct response to lps or lta (0.1 to 20.0 micrograms/ml). at the  highest dose of both antigens, prostaglandin e2 production was increased. we then studied whether lps and lta could signal collagenase production by interacting primarily with a different cell type. our results show that lps and lta were each able to stimulate cultures of human blood mononuclear cells (greater than 95% monocytes) to release collagenase-inducing cytokines. by indirect immunocytochemistry, we found that a large proportion of human gingival fibroblasts was activated to produce collagenase by supernatants from lps- and lta-stimulated mononuclear cells, whereas gingival fibroblasts cultured with supernatants from unstimulated mononuclear cells were not. furthermore, in a population of activated fibroblasts we demonstrated, using a double-labeling technique, that some cells made collagenase and the specific tissue inhibitor of  metalloproteinases (timp) simultaneously. as yet, the collagenase-inducing signals remain poorly characterized but the interleukins-1 and tumor necrosis factors seem likely candidates.

TI  == fimbria-associated proteins of bacteroides loescheii pk1295 mediate intergeneric  coaggregations.
AB  == bacteroides loescheii pk1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between streptococcus sanguis 34 and actinomyces israelii pk14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. whereas coaggregation with s.  sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with a. israelii pk14. coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of b. loescheii pk1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. selection for spontaneously occurring cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. type i lost the ability to coaggregate with s. sanguis 34, whereas type ii failed to coaggregate with either s. sanguis 34 or a. israelii pk14. purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and  agglutination with s. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kda) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kda protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type i mutant. neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type ii  mutants. our data suggest that coaggregation of b. loescheii pk1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the  surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kda polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of s. sanguis 34 and a. israelii pk14 cells,  respectively.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == dietary carbohydrate type and cholesterol-induced hypercholesterolemia in cynomolgus monkeys: influence of oral antibiotic.
AB  == the relationship of carbohydrate type to cholesterol-induced hypercholesterolemia and the potential role of intestinal flora in the above process were examined in  12 male cynomolgus monkeys (m. fascicularis). semipurified diets provided two types of carbohydrates (starch or sucrose, 49% by calorie) with 0.4 mg cholesterol/kcal. six weeks of the starch diet resulted in significantly enhanced hypercholesterolemia when compared to sucrose diet. starch in relation to sucrose produced cholesterol enrichment of intermediate density lipoproteins and increase in low density lipoprotein particles, whereas sucrose increased high density lipoprotein constituents (phospholipids, cholesterol, and apoa-i) and triglyceride content of very low density lipoproteins. fecal escherichia counts were high during the starch diet as contrasted with sucrose diet, but the escherichia, streptococcus, and bacteroides groups did not show differences by diet following each consecutive 4-week period of oral neomycin (107 mg/kg body wt) treatment and withdrawal. the magnitude of hypercholesterolemia during these  periods also remained similar between starch and sucrose, suggesting formation of germfree metabolic characteristics. thus, the magnitude of cholesterol-induced hypercholesterolemia can be affected by the type of carbohydrate, which may be in part determined by intestinal flora metabolism.

TI  == structural determinants of activity of chlorhexidine and alkyl bisbiguanides against the human oral flora.
AB  == we assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative as well as the gram-positive oral bacteria. the alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane)  and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against fusobacterium nucleatum, also  associated with periodontal disease. seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against actinomyces species. all test agents were active against streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == samples of hydroxyapatite (ha) beads smaller than 1 mg were coated with 10 microliter of either saliva, serum, or human crevicular fluid before being added  to a suspension of streptococcus sanguis or bacteroides gingivalis. in some assays, preparations of a granular fraction, elastase, or cathepsin g from human  leukocytes were used to coat ha or to treat saliva-coated ha (sha) before mixing  with bacteria. the number of cells adhering to the beads was then counted under a scanning electron microscope by a standardized procedure. more cells were found to adhere to sha in this assay than in the conventional large-scale assay. human  crevicular fluid, even when diluted up to three times, completely inhibited the adherence of s. sanguis to ha. a 100% inhibition of s. sanguis adherence was also observed when ha was coated with the granular fraction of leukocytes, and a 65% inhibition observed when sha was treated with the enzyme preparation. when used to coat ha, elastase and cathepsin g reduced the adherence of s. sanguis by 30 and 50%, respectively. the binding of s. sanguis to elastase- or cathepsin g-treated sha was also reduced. b. gingivalis 33277 was found to adhere in high numbers to sha. coating ha with crevicular fluid or with the lysosomal enzyme preparation had a limited negative effect. we postulate that crevicular fluid prevents the adherence of s. sanguis by virtue of either its enzyme content or its albumin content or both.

TI  == characterization of lectinlike surface components on capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 that mediate coaggregation with gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the interactions between capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 and streptococcus sanguis h1, actinomyces naeslundii pk984, or actinomyces israelii pk16 are dependent on specific recognitions between heat-sensitive adhesins on c. ochracea and heat-stable structures (probably carbohydrate-containing receptors) on the surfaces of these gram-positive coaggregation partners. the coaggregation of c. ochracea with each of these three organisms was inhibited by l-rhamnose and d-fucose and to a lesser extent by beta-methyl-galactoside. the reaction with s.  sanguis was the most sensitive, while the coaggregation with a. israelii was the  least sensitive and was only partially inhibited by each of the sugars that were  considered to be effective inhibitors. a more effective inhibition of the coaggregation between c. ochracea and a. israelii was achieved by adding a combination of the 6-deoxysugars and n-acetylneuraminic acid. to further characterize the coaggregations, naturally occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of c. ochracea were obtained from several different selections. three phenotypically distinct groups of mutants were were isolated. type 1 mutants failed to coaggregate with s. sanguis only. type 2 mutants lost ability to interact with both s. sanguis and a. naeslundii. type 3 mutants failed to coaggregate with all three coaggregation partners. characterization of the cog- mutants by sugar inhibition studies made it possible to distinguish three classes of adhesin activity.

TI  == organisms isolated from severe odontogenic soft tissue infections: their sensitivities to cefotetan and seven other antibiotics, and implications for therapy and prophylaxis.
AB  == cefotetan is a new cephamycin antibiotic characterised by excellent b-lactamase stability and anti-anaerobe activity, coupled with a long half life of 3-4 h which permits twice daily dosage. a clinical trial of cefotetan in the treatment  of severe oro-facial infections is presented, together with a detailed analysis of the causative organisms and their sensitivities to eight antibiotics. 50/50 patients achieved clinical cure with a treatment regime comprising cefotetan therapy and incision and drainage, with patients being transferred to oral cephradine for the final phase of therapy. side effects were minimal and there were no instances of relapse. significant resistance among alpha-haemolytic streptococci and bacteroides organisms to penicillin was observed. the streptococci were resistant due to mechanisms other than beta-lactamase production. in the light of these findings and the reports of other workers it is suggested that penicillin v may no longer be the most appropriate drug for endocarditis prophylaxis, despite the most recent recommendations of the american heart association. furthermore, if penicillin v is used for this purpose, a penicillin free interval of 6-8 weeks may be inadequate before this drug is used. cefotetan is not suitable for prophylaxis against endocarditis.

TI  == multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  == a radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. the cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. the coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. however, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. this not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. while the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

AB  == the intestinal flora was studied in 12 volunteers after the administration of 400 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d. over seven days. stool samples were taken prior to and several times after the initiation of therapy, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of microorganisms were performed. escherichia coli was eliminated in all volunteers after two days of treatment. a selection of resistant enterobacteria could not be observed. a higher incidence of streptococcus faecium was seen, mainly after the end of drug application. the number of cfu of bacteroides and bifidus species remained unchanged during the trial. there was no selection of clostridium difficile. based on this pattern of activity on the stool flora we suggest that ciprofloxacin could represent an appropriate drug for the therapy of bacterial intestinal infections as well as for selective decontamination in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == lactic acid production by oral streptococcus mitis inhibits the growth of oral capnocytophaga.
AB  == various relationships including inhibition or stimulation of growth have been demonstrated among the bacteria present in dental plaque, both in vitro and in vivo. a large number of these relationships involved oral streptococci. an earlier study found that strains of streptococcus mitis inhibited the growth of potential periodontopathic microorganisms, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga and species of bacteroides and fusobacterium. the present investigation showed that this inhibitory effect resulted primarily from lactic acid production.

TI  == immunoglobulin a subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.
AB  == the distribution of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and iga2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the iga subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. in 12 subjects examined, antibodies to streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen i/ii, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans b1355 fraction s and b512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the iga1 subclass. in contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli were predominantly of the iga2 subclass. the data  indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of iga.

AB  == the sequential acquisition of bacterial flora by premature neonates was studied during a 10 month period. mean gestational age of the babies was 29.01 weeks and  the mean birth weight was 1.728 kg. escherichia coli and group b streptococci (gbs) colonized the umbilicus of 7 and 6 babies respectively, out of 23 studied,  on the first day of life. e. coli and staphylococci were the predominant flora on the 6th day and they colonized 12 and 13 respectively. the oral flora was predominantly gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococcus salivarius which was isolated from 17 out of 22 babies on the 6th day, viridans streptococci were isolated from 14 babies, staphylococcus albus from 16 babies and group d streptococci from 11 babies. candida spp. also colonized the oral cavities of 17  out of 22 babies on the 6th day. at the end of the first week of life, the faecal flora was predominantly anaerobic represented by bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. the commonest facultative faecal flora were e. coli, which was isolated from all the babies, and strept. faecalis isolated from 20 babies. early gut colonization by gbs, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. was noticed in more babies delivered vaginally than by caesarean section where colonization by these bacteria was relatively delayed. the use of prophylactic penicillin plus gentamicin in the special neonatal unit probably prevented systemic spread of any of the potential opportunistic pathogens during  the study.

AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == microbial ecology of plaque in rats with naturally occurring gingivitis.
AB  == the microbial ecology of adherent plaque was investigated in relation to the pathological findings of gingivitis in plaque-susceptible rats. plaque developed  in the gingiva of the lower incisor in plaque-susceptible rats, but not in plaque-resistant rats, after they were fed a commercial powder diet. with increase in plaque volume, the total counts of bacteria increased 10(9) to 10(11)/g. in the first 3 months, bacteroides species increased and became the predominant population. streptococcus species also increased at the same time. after 9 months, fusobacterium species and oral treponema species were recognized  in increasing numbers. the anaerobic bacteria increased in proportion with the progression of plaque development. bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus salivarius, and other species were isolated. acute gingivitis was observed within 3 months, and subacute-chronic gingivitis was observed between 2 and 12 months. these findings suggest that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

TI  == comparative bacteriology of juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == statistical comparisons of the floras associated with juvenile periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and moderate periodontitis indicated that differences in the bacterial compositions of affected sites in these populations were not statistically significant. the subgingival flora of affected juvenile periodontitis sites was statistically significantly different from the adjacent supragingival flora and from the subgingival floras of people with healthy gingiva and of children with developing (experimental) gingivitis. however, the subgingival flora of affected juvenile periodontitis sites was not significantly  different from the flora of sites with gingival index scores of 1 or 2 in adults  with developing (experimental) gingivitis. of 357 bacterial taxa among over 18,000 isolates, 54 non-treponemal species, 2 treponemal species, and mycoplasma  were most associated with diseased periodontal sulci. these species comprised an  increasing proportion of the flora during developing gingivitis and constituted over half of the cultivable flora of diseased sites.

TI  == the relationships between streptococcal species and periodontopathic bacteria in  human dental plaque.
AB  == the existence of antagonistic and commensal relationships between microorganisms  was investigated. the predominant cultivable flora in 172 plaque samples from active and non-active sites in 32 human subjects with destructive periodontitis was determined. the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms (bacteroides  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, wolinella recta, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and eikenella corrodens) in a site was correlated with the absence of certain viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus uberis and streptococcus intermedius), and vice versa. a strong commensal relationship was found between b. gingivalis and strep. intermedius. the second study involved 3 subjects with intractable periodontitis  whose plaque harboured large numbers of one or more of these periodontopathic organisms. this plaque contained fewer organisms capable of inhibiting the growth of the periodontopathic strains in vitro when compared with a clinically-healthy  control subject. intermediate levels of inhibitors were found in plaque taken from non-active lesions. the majority of inhibitors in plaque from the healthy control were viridans streptococci. hydrogen-peroxide production by these organisms appears to be the principal mechanism of growth inhibition for periodontopathic organisms. bacterial interactions may thus be causally related to both periodontal health and disease.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == colonization of the subgingival area by bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  == the initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by b. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. the level of b. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. once b. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the b. gingivalis product, hematin. the bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against actinomyces species. this was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of b. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by b. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.

TI  == synthesis and antimicrobial activity of clindamycin analogues: pirlimycin, 1,2 a  potent antibacterial agent.
AB  == the preparation of a series of analogues of clindamycin is described in which the naturally occurring five-membered cyclic amino acid amide portion of the molecule is replaced by a four-, six-, or seven-membered cyclic amino acid amide. the most interesting compound is pirlimycin (7e, u-57,930e), in which the (2s-trans)-4-n-propylhygramide portion of clindamycin is replaced by (2s-cis)-4-ethylpipecolamide. this structural modification results in significantly favorable changes in toxicity, metabolism, and antibacterial potency. although the in vitro antibacterial activity of clindamycin and pirlimycin are nearly identical, the latter compound is 2-20 times more active than clindamycin when administered to mice experimentally infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and plasmodium berghei. pirlimycin is absorbed in rats and  mice following both subcutaneous and oral administration. it readily penetrates b. fragilis induced abscesses in mice and is sequestered within these abscesses.  a drug concentration of at least 60 times the required inhibitory concentration is maintained for 6 h following a single subcutaneous dose of 200 mg/kg. urinary  excretion of total bioactivity consists only of intact pirlimycin with no other antibacterially active metabolites being detected. pirlimycin is tolerated well in rats and mice at the administered levels.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed infections in the oral cavity.
AB  == in almost all infections in the oral cavity, mixed populations of bacteria are present. however, recent evidence points to a certain specificity in these infections: streptococcus mutans is related to caries and black-pigmented bacteroides species are suspected pathogens in periodontal disease. periodontal diseases, endodontic infections and submucous abscesses in the oral cavity are probably mixed infections in which anaerobic bacteria together with facultatives  or other anaerobes are present. in experimental mixed anaerobic infections black-pigmented bacteroides strains have been shown to play a key role. little is known about the pathogenic synergy between the bacteria involved in mixed infections. important mechanisms could be nutritional interrelationships and interactions with the host defense. within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides b. gingivalis seems to be the most virulent species. these bacteria possess a great number of virulence factors, which might be important in the pathogenesis of oral infections.

TI  == physiology and ecology of the vagina.
AB  == the human vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium which has no glands.  major components of the vaginal secretions are transudate through the vaginal walls, desquamating epithelial cells, cervical mucus, fluids from the upper genital tract, and leukocytes. estrogens and sexual stimulation are examples of factors which increase vaginal fluid. major organic constituents of the vaginal fluid are proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids. organic acids arise as metabolic byproducts of vaginal bacterial flora, cause the vaginal odor, and show cyclic changes except in oral contraceptive users. qualitative and quantitative studies in humans as well as animal model studies have confirmed that the vaginal flora is a dynamic and closely interrelated system. lactobacilli are most prevalent, but many other facultative and anaerobic organisms are present. an inverse relationship exists between the concentration of lactobacilli and other bacteria such as anaerobes. aerobic bacteria decrease premenstrually whereas anaerobes, in general, remain at constant levels. during menarche, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, and postoperative trauma, dramatic changes occur in the microbial flora. the role of an iud in causing changes in the microbial flora is under great scrutiny at the present time. overall, disturbances in the vaginal ecosystem may have a potential impact on many diseases, and thus deserve careful  studies.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

AB  == four bacterial strains collected from tooth surface, oral buccal mucosa, skin of  the upper lip, and rectum were used to evaluate the specificity of salivary agglutinins. a saliva sample was absorbed with each of the strains, and the remaining supernatants were tested for agglutinin activity against all strains. the effect of concanavalin a and ph on the s. mutans and s. mitior agglutinins was studied. the conclusion was drawn that the agglutinins for the s. mutans and  s. mitior strains differed but that the s. mitior strain rested carried a receptor site for the s. mutans agglutinin without becoming agglutinated. the s.  mutans agglutinin seems to have either unsubstituted mannopyranosyl or n-acetylated glucopyranosyl residues as structural components.

TI  == the development of the bacterial flora in normal neonates.
AB  == the development of the bacterial flora of neonates during the first week of life  was studied in 23 babies. specimens of meconium or faeces were collected and swabs taken from the umbilicus and mouth on days, 1, 2, 3 and 6. the bacteria present were isolated on a variety of plain and selective media. the predominant  faecal organisms by the end of the first week were anaerobes. bifidobacteria were isolated from all the neonates and bacteroides and clostridia were isolated from  78.3%. bifidobacteria and bacteroides were present in large numbers; other species were isolated in smaller numbers. enterococci were isolated from all neonates, enterobacteria from 82.6%, anaerobic cocci from 52.2%, and streptococci and staphylococci from 34.8% each. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was isolated from 21.7% of neonates on the first day rising to 87.0% by the sixth day and represented 49% of isolates from this site. s. albus, streptococci, enterococci and escherichia coli were each isolated from a few neonates. viridans streptococci (31.4% of isolates) and  streptococcus salivarius (25.1%) were the commonest species recovered from the mouth. they were present from 8 h after birth; s. albus and neisseria spp. were isolated later on the first day, and anaerobic species of veillonella and bifidobacterium appeared on the second day.

TI  == the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of beagle dogs with periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora was studied in 10 adult female beagle dogs with advanced periodontitis. supragingival and subgingival plaque from a maxillary third premolar (p3) was removed and cultured anaerobically on various growth media and all colonies were subcultured and partially characterized. histopathological specimens of the plaque sampling sites showed significant loss of connective tissue attachment. spirochetes were found in all samples. anaerobic gram-negative organisms were predominant in both types of plaque accounting for about 55% of the cultivable organisms in the supragingival  plaque and almost 75% in the subgingival plaque. bacteroides asaccharolyticus was the most predominant organism in the supragingival plaque, whereas fusobacterium  nucleatum predominated in the subgingival flora. streptococcal and actinomycotic  species were common in the supragingival plaque, but their proportions, especially those of the actinomycetes, were decreased in the subgingival flora. in many respects the bacterial profile associated with disease resembled that reported in human periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with streptococcus and bacteroides.
AB  == oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (ha) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of ha-active f. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. ha-active sonicated fragments (sf) prepared from f. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. attachment of f. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the ha activity of the sf in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. ha activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of f. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment.  of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed f. nucleatum ha-active fragments. they included bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, bacteroides corrodens, streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus sanguis (blackburn and jc 74) and streptococcus mutans aht, bht, 10449 and 6715. chelators revealed that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a ca2+-dependent interaction. sugar inhibition demonstrated that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a d-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. a reduction in the absorption of f. nucleatum ha-active fragments by strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

AB  == model systems simulating the cementum portion of teeth were used to characterize  the attachment process by which certain species of oral cytophaga initiate the colonization of the tooth root surface in vitro. the adsorption of these bacteria to spheroidal hydroxyapatite beads and mechanically powdered root material followed langmuir isotherm kinetics. from such data, the number of binding sites  per 20 mg of substrate and the affinity constants were evaluated for two strains  of cytophaga sp. resting cells of the two strains tested adhered relatively tenaciously to hydroxyapatite beads in numbers similar to those observed with cells of streptococcus sanguis. attachment of bacteria to the substrates was partially inhibited by (i) coating the substrates with human serum or saliva, (ii) pretreating cell suspensions with proteinase k or phospholipase c or d, or (iii) exposing the cells to temperatures greater than 60 degrees c for 15 min. treating resting cell suspensions with pronase, neuraminidase, phospholipase a2,  or 0.1 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid had no effect on the attachment process.

TI  == lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  == we assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. when the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. the actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas streptococcus sanguis, campylobacter, and eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. the response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. however, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides asaccharolyticus and treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. these results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease  states.

AB  == the lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. in addition, a group  of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in  response to the same stimulants. the stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides [capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin a, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). intrinsic (cells cultured in male ab plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. there was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. we propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.

TI  == insoluble glucan hydrolyzing enzymes from oral bacteroides.
AB  == crude enzymes (en(c)) which hydrolyze insoluble glucan produced by streptococcus  mutans fa-1 were extracted from bacteroides oralis obtained from human dental plaque. extracellular insoluble glucan of s. mutans (isg) and the one which was partially modified by smith degradation (m-isg) were used as substrates. commercial dextran (m.w. 2,000,000) was used as control. composition of the types of glucosidic linkages of the glucans was determined by methylation analysis. the ratio of the alpha-(1--6) linkage and alpha-(1--3) linkage was 96.3% and 0.5% for dextran, 29.2% and 55.1% for isg and 11.9% and 84.9% for m-isg. en(c) was extracted by salting out of the culture of b. oralis with 60% saturation of ammonium sulfate. en(c) hydrolyzed isg, m-isg and dextran, whereas commercial dextranase (alpha-1,6 glucanase) hydrolyzed only dextran. isg was treated with the commercial dextranase until no glucose was detected in the medium, and the remaining material was used for the substrate of enzymes. release of glucose was  detected from the substrate by treatment with en(c), but not with commercial dextranase. these results indicated that en(c) of bacteroides oralis contained at least two types of glucanase, one being dextranase which hydrolyzes the alpha-(1--6) linkage and the other the so-called mutanase which hydrolyzes the alpha-(1--3) linkage.

AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.
