TI  == a study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. methods: the bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar and bhi blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. results: the optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. there was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence  intensity and bacterial concentration. the mean optical density (mod) of s. mutans and l. acidophilus cultivated in bhi blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, p < 0.05). the mod of s. sanguis, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia cultivated in bhi blood agar was higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (37 +/-  12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, p > 0.05); the opposite was observed for c. albicans. conclusion: at 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic  bacteria. the fluorescence energy, q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI  == the natural antimicrobial subtilosin a synergizes with lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (polylysine), clindamycin phosphate and metronidazole, against the vaginal pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. bv is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately lactobacillus to a multispecies actinomyces biofilm  with the most common representatives identified as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella spp. current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. the objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against g. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. the four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin a. the use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins  as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. the microdilution method was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these mics in combination. clindamycin and subtilosin (cs), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against g. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). all tested combinations were found to have bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and polylysine (cp) was identified  as antagonistic against l. acidophilus in terms of both fici and bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (cm) was antagonistic against l. vaginalis for both fici and bliss synergy. the combinations of cp, clindamycin and lae, cs, and lae and polylysine were identified as bliss antagonistic against l. vaginalis but did not indicate fici antagonism.

TI  == an investigation of the effect of scaling-induced surface roughness on bacterial  adhesion in common fixed dental restorative materials.
AB  == statement of problem: bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. however, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. purpose: the purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. material and methods: forty specimens each of type iii gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. the specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. surface treatments in each  group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. in turn, the specimens were inoculated with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus. bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. the specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 ml of sterile saline. the solution was plated and quantified. scanning electron microscopy was performed. the statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor anova with a bonferroni correction. results: the surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 ra) (p<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 ra) (p<.01). the results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. a quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. in spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (p<.05). instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (p<.05). conclusions: the results of this investigation indicate that type iii gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial  adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.

TI  == effects of probiotics on the growth performance and intestinal micro flora of broiler chickens.
AB  == antibiotics have been used in poultry industry for decades to promote growth and  protect animals from diseases, followed by various side effects. in efforts of searching for a better alternative, probiotic is of extensive attention. we investigated the effects of bacillus subtitles, rhodopseudomonas palustris, candida utilis and lactobacillus acidophilus as 0.1% (w/w) feed additives on broiler growth performance and intestinal microflora. the results showed the probiotics treatments significantly improved growth of broilers. broilers supplemented with b. subtilis and l. acidophilus weighed 18.4% and 10.1% more than birds in control group at 42 days of age. furthermore the feed conversion ratios of the birds in the two groups were also improved, decreasing 9.1% and 12.9%, respectively. further study indicated a significant increase of cecal lactobacilli concentration in briolers supplemented with probiotics, expecially in l. acidophilus treatment group. meanwhile, the count of cecal actinomyces in birds treated with probiotics was significantly lower compared with the control group. in conclusion, probiotics such as b. subtitles and l. acidophilus are good alternatives to antibiotics in promoting growth resulting from a beneficial modulation of the intestinal micro flora, which leads to increased efficiency of  intestinal digestion in the host animal.

TI  == dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, streptococcus mutans.
AB  == although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, s. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. during the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against s. mutans. early attempts used fixed whole cells of s. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of s. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. in this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against s. mutans.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == dental caries vaccine.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. in modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by  host, agent, and environmental factors. the time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. a wide group of microorganisms are  identified from carious lesions of which s. mutans , lactobacillus acidophilus ,  and actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. in india, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. surveys among the u.s. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is  the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. these dental caries vaccines  are still in the early stages.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

AB  == aims: to assess the impact of different implant systems on the clinical conditions and the microbiota at implants, and whether the presence of bacteria at tooth sites was predictive of the presence at implant sites. materials and methods: subjects with either astratech or branemark in function for 7 years were enrolled. sub-gingival bacterial samples at tooth and implant sites were collected with sterile endodontic paper points, and analyzed by the checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization method (40 species). results: fifty-four subjects, 27 supplied with astratech (n=132 implants) and 27 with branemark (n=102) implants,  were studied. test tooth sites had significantly less evidence of bleeding on probing (p<0.001) and presence of plaque (p<0.001) than implant test sites. implant sites presented with deeper probing pocket depth than tooth sites (mean difference: 1.1 mm, standard error of differences: 0.08, 95% confidence intervals (ci): 0.9-1.3, p<0.001). tannerella forsythia (p<0.05), capnocytophaga sputigena  (p<0.05), actinomyces israelii (p<0.05) and lactobacillus acidophilus (p<0.05) were found at higher levels at tooth surfaces. no differences in bacterial load for any species were found between the two implant systems. the odds of being present/absent at tooth and implants sites were only significant for staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (or): 5.2 : 1, 95% ci: 1.4-18.9, p<0.01]. conclusions: after 7 years in function, implants presented with deeper probing depths than teeth. s. aureus was commonly present at both teeth and implants sites. s. aureus at tooth sites was predictive of also being present at implant sites.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of bacterial growth using different dental adhesive systems.
AB  == objectives: this study evaluated the antibacterial potential of four different adhesive systems. methods & materials: gluma comfort bond + desensitizer, gluma comfort bond, ibond and one-up bond f were tested against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces viscosus. the inhibition of growth by calibrated preparations was quantified by the measurement of zones of inhibition on bacterial lawns. bactericidal activity was determined as reductions in recoverable colony-forming units in bacterial suspensions exposed to test preparations. results: all the preparations exhibited detectable  zones of inhibition for all target bacteria through six months. when the bactericidal action was evaluated, all the materials were able to kill all the tested bacteria when tested immediately after polymerization. after one week of aging, ibond was the only material that continued to kill all of the test strains.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == incipient caries lesions on cementum by mono- and co-culture oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: there is increasing prevalence of root caries. we hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. this study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces israelii. sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. materials and methods: the matrix (amide i) and phosphate content  of the lesions was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (sem-edx). results: the log[amide i:hpo(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that a. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[ca:p] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. conclusions: oral biofilm arising  from bacterial species a. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested  and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.

TI  == red autofluorescence of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == red autofluorescence of plaque and its relation to fluorescence of a single species in the biofilm was studied. fluorescence images of non-disclosed and disclosed plaque of 28 first-year students were captured. the plaque samples were assessed by culture methods and studied for red autofluorescence. species capable of producing red autofluorescence were cultivated from subjects with and without  red plaque autofluorescence. red autofluorescence was observed from actinomyces odontolyticus, prevotella intermedia and from porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros grown together. the microbial findings indicated that the intrinsic characteristics of the mature biofilm itself are more responsible for the red autofluorescence than the characteristics of the single species.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

AB  == background: gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. methods: to test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also  associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. the study population consisted of 297 predominantly african- american women who were pregnant for the first time. the salivary bacterial levels evaluated were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. results: for 1 unit increase in log(10) a. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; se = 29.1; p = 0.04), and a 0.17  week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; se = 0.09; p = 0.05). in contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) l. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; se = 19.3; p = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; se = 0.06; p = 0.04). conclusions: we conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. these organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.

TI  == effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == background: cecropin-xj belongs to cecropin-b, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. methods: four oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-xj. mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (mtt) colorimetric assay. the bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-xj were examined on scanning  electron microscope (sem). the influence of cecropin-xj on bacterial adhesion to  saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) was measured by scintillation counting. results: the mics of cecropin-xj for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/l with the highest susceptible to a. naeslundii  and the lowest susceptible to l. acidophilus. at ph 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 mic of  cecropin-xj reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for s. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for l. acidophilus. the activities against s. mutans and l. acidophilus increased at ph 5.5 compared with ph 6.8 (p  < 0.01, respectively). in present of 50% saliva, 1/2 mic of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for s. mutans and l. acidophilus, respectively (p < 0.01 and p > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria  (p > 0.05, respectively). mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj from 1.0 to 100 micromol/l exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (p > 0.05). bacterial morphological changes induced by mic of cecropin-xj examined on sem showed cell surface disruption. furthermore, the ability of a. naeslundii adhesion to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 10 and 20 minutes (p = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and s. mutans, a. viscosus to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 20 minutes (p = 0.000, respectively). conclusions: cecropin-xj exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity  enhanced in the acid environment. the results also demonstrate that cecropin-xj prevents s. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that cecropin-xj may have potential to prevent caries.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == [dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

TI  == microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate,  clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

TI  == calibrated latex microspheres percolation: a possible route to model endodontic bacterial leakage.
AB  == endodontic therapy is conducted to effectively seal the root canal system. in vitro methods are used to estimate the quality of the seal, generally by measuring any microleakage that allows the tracers to penetrate along the obturated root canal. the use of bacteria as tracers seems to give the most clinically relevant demonstration of microleakage associated with a root canal system. many bacterial strains have been used to evaluate marginal leakage, but results are sometimes contradictory, probably because they may depend on the bacterial strain used. in the studies described in this article, the percolation  of both calibrated latex microspheres equivalent in diameter (0.4-9.5 microm) to  bacteria and three bacterial strains (actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and pseudomonas fluorescens) was compared in teeth filled using noncompressive and compressive techniques. the depth (d) to which the microspheres and bacteria penetrated varied over the time (t) of contamination according to a logarithmic relation. the slope (s) and the intercept (i, corresponding to penetration after 1 month) of the d = f(in t) plots can serve to quantify penetration over time. statistical analysis of i by the newman-keuls procedure, which couples the tracers and filling techniques, showed that a. odontolyticus and l. acidophilus behave like 4.8-microm particles and p. fluorescens like 2.2-microm particles (corresponding approximately to their size  in length) and that noncompressive techniques are less hermetic than compressive  techniques. s and i are in direct relation and this relation is independent of the filling technique. moreover, for the calibrated particles, both i and s varied linearly with the inverse of the square root of the particle diameter, indicating that their displacements are governed solely by brownian movements and the penetration over time is caused by diffusion phenomena. the size of the tracer is the predominant factor governing its penetration. inert particles mimic bacterial percolation into the marginal hiatus and can thus be used to model this percolation and establish a relative scale of the behavior of different bacteria  during percolation.

AB  == the objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (gic). this was assessed using an agar diffusion test. chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to fuji  ix gic at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. antibacterial-gic specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (streptococcis, lactobacillus, and actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. the experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. control specimens of the gic produced no bacterial inhibition. the antibacterial-gic combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on  week 1. ct-gic showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. the addition of antibacterial agents to fuji ix creates a gic material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == bacterial growth inhibition and short-term clinical efficacy of a vegetable oil-based mouthrinse: preliminary study.
AB  == bacterial growth of a vegetable oil-based product was determined in vitro. growth of streptococcus mutans and veillonella alcalescens was strongly inhibited for dilutions up to 50x. on the basis of these results, it was decided to evaluate the short-term, clinical efficacy of a 1:10 dilution of the concentrated product  in water. fifteen human volunteers employed this rinse twice-a-day during a six-day period. planimetric plaque scores, as well as the plaque and gingival indexes according to loe, were assessed at the beginning and end of this period.  the efficacy of such a rinse, though less than of chlorhexidine-based products, turned out comparable to several other commercially available products with a reasonable potential in maintaining a low gingival index.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == [isolation and identification of gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  == thirty-four strains of gardnerella vaginalis were studied. they were isolated from non specific vaginitis. a presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. the differentiation of gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in glc. all gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. they are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  == six species of microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of cd per ml. at 40 and 80 mug of cd per ml, e. coli and b. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed.  cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. the significance of these data with respect to cd in food chains is discussed.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI  == indirect fluorescent-antibody method for the identification of corynebacterium vaginale.
AB  == the indirect fluorescent-antibody technique was employed in an attempt to develop a rapid method of identification of corynebacterium vaginale. six reference strains and ten clinical isolates selected on the basis of morphology and conventional biochemical tests were compared. antisera were prepared in rabbits against the six reference strains. the most satisfactory antiserum was that prepared using strain 14018 grown diphasically (14018 di) as the antigen. certain of the antisera did exhibit a cross-reacting titer when reacted against corynebacterium diptheriae, corynebacterium xerosis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. however, antisera adsorbed with these bacteria did not exhibit a significant decrease in titer when reacted against the homologous strain. various other species of corynebacterium as well as species of nocardia, actinomyces, hemophilus, and streptococcus did not fluoresce with the antisera. a specific antiserum was prepared by adsorbing anti-14018 di with l. acidophilus. the adsorption removed the cross-reacting antibody but did not affect the staining reaction with c. vaginale strains. all reference strains and clinical isolates characterized as c. vaginale gave a definite positive reaction with the adsorbed  anti-14018 di. the specificity of the reactions was assessed by adsorbing the antiserum with the homologous strain. the data suggest that the indirect staining method will be of value in the rapid presumptive identification of c. vaginale.
