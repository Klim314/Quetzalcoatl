TI  == bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein inhibits growth of a strain of acholeplasma laidlawii and l forms of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) inhibited growth of cell wall-deficient acholeplasma laidlawii and l forms of certain strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. however, the same strains of s. aureus and s. pyogenes with intact cell walls were not susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effects of bpi.
