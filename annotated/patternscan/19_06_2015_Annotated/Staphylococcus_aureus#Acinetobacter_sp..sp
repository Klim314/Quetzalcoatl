TI  == antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum.
AB  == objective: sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. it is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufas) and beta-carotene. this study was undertaken  to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin diadema setosum against selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. materials and methods: the ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. the obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: gram-negative bacteria (salmonella typhi, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, acinetobacter sp, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumonia) and gram-positive bacteria (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus). the activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). results: the methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against s. typhi, s. epidermidis, c. freundii and k. pneumonia. the results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. moreover, the result indicates  the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. conclusions: the study  suggests that the ovary extract of d. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == design of a papain immobilized antimicrobial food package with curcumin as a crosslinker.
AB  == contamination of food products by spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms during post process handling is one of the major causes for food spoilage and food borne illnesses. the present green sustainable approach describes the covalent immobilization of papain to ldpe (low density polyethylene), hdpe (high density polyethylene), lldpe (linear low density polyethylene) and pcl (polycaprolactam)  with curcumin as the photocrosslinker. about 50% of curcumin and 82-92% of papain were successfully immobilized on these polymers. after 30 days, the free enzyme retained 87% of its original activity, while the immobilized enzyme retained more than 90% of its activity on these polymers. papain crosslinked to lldpe exhibited the best antibiofilm properties against acinetobacter sp. kc119137.1 and staphylococcus aureus ncim 5021 when compared to the other three polymers, because of the highest amount of enzyme immobilized on this surface. papain acts  by damaging the cell membrane. the enzyme is able to reduce the amount of carbohydrate and protein contents in the biofilms formed by these organisms. meat wrapped with the modified ldpe and stored at 4 degrees c showed 9 log reduction of these organisms at the end of the seventh day when compared to samples wrapped with the bare polymer. this method of crosslinking can be used on polymers with or without functional groups and can be adopted to bind any type of antimicrobial agent.

TI  == ecological competition and the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in southeastern brazil.
AB  == introduction: recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (hais). acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause hais.  it is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii infection. methods: we conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (ha-bsis) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in brazil. ha-bsis were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered  from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. monthly incidence rates were calculated for all ha-bsis (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). multivariate poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii. results: the overall incidence rate of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. in the multivariate analysis, the incidence of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of ha-bsi due to staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [rr]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.80-0.97), enterobacter spp. (rr=0.84; 95%ci=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of ha-bsis. it would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.

TI  == antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, eupenicillium sp.  lg41.
AB  == two new compounds containing the decalin moiety, eupenicinicols a and b (1 and 2), two new sirenin derivatives, eupenicisirenins a and b (3 and 4), and four known compounds, (2s)-butylitaconic acid (5), (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6), xanthomegnin (7), and viridicatumtoxin (8), were isolated from an endophytic fungus, eupenicillium sp. lg41, harbored in the roots of the chinese medicinal plant xanthium sibiricum. their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (nmr and hrms(n)), and their absolute configurations were  deduced by ecd calculations or optical rotation data. since the endophytic fungus was isolated from the roots, the antibacterial efficacies of the compounds 1-6 were investigated against bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter sp. bd4, which typically inhabit soil, as well as the clinically important staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. (2s)-butylitaconic acid (5) and (2s)-hexylitaconic acid (6) exhibited pronounced efficacy against acinetobacter sp., corroborating the notion that root-endophytes provide chemical defense to the host plants. compound 2 was  highly active against the clinically relevant s. aureus. by comparing 1 with 2, it was revealed that altering the substitution at c-11 could drastically increase the antibacterial efficacy of 1. our study reveals plausible ecological roles of  the endophyte and its potential pharmaceutical use as a source of antibacterial compounds.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in bacterial isolates from a delhi hospital: one year outcomes.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance and hospital acquired infections have become an important public health issue. data on pathogen and antibiotic resistance is important for physicians, microbiologists and infection control officials but limited information on antibiotic resistance prevents pathogen specific therapy and propels antibiotic misuse. a retrospective review of bacterial isolation and  antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in the in- and outpatients of a delhi hospital between january 2009-december 2009 was performed. a total of 1772 pathogens causing bacterial infections were recorded during the study period january 2009-december 2009. the most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens were escherichia coli (40.51%), klebsiella spp. (14.84%) and staphylococcus aureus (13.99%). we encountered high resistance to ciprofloxacin in enterobactereaceae family, i.e., 32.5%. aminoglycosides, once considered optimum  for broad spectrum coverage of pathogens for almost all systemic infections, are  now showing high rate of resistance as was noted in acinetobacter sp. (57.14%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (69.2%). antibiotic susceptibility results show a higher level of resistance to cotrimoxazole, cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin which are easily available, orally administered and cheaper and thus are considered a better option for the patients. this study provides insight into the problem of resistance in bacterial pathogens in delhi. our results demonstrated that, in general, isolates have high rates of resistance to antibiotics commonly  used in developing countries. guidelines for surveillance and prevention of nosocomial infections must be implemented in order to reduce the rate of hospital acquired infections.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  == microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. however, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in china. we  conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (ni) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from january 2003 to december 2010. we studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. the number of nis per 100 admissions was 10.9. the commonest isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and candida (11.4%). the result indicated that the numbers of patients with acinetobacter sp. infection increased (p=0.004), but with proteus mirabilis infection decreased (p=0.004). the isolated acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost  all antibiotics tested. notably, more frequent acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the p. aeruginosa and e. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. the increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
AB  == background: with the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. we aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. methods: between july 2008 and august 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a taiwan medical center were enrolled. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with vitek-2 system and was analyzed according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. we followed usa food and drug administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. results: the median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. after tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. a baumannii and p aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. the tigecycline  susceptibility rate of a baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. conclusion: the most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were a baumannii and p aeruginosa. tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of a baumannii, methicillin-resistant s aureus, e coli, and k pneumoniae. exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of a baumannii for tigecycline.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

TI  == the effect of age on the bacteria isolated and the antibiotic-sensitivity pattern in infections among cancer patients.
AB  == background: patients with cancer are predisposed to infections. antimicrobial patterns and antibiotic sensitivity change with increasing age, making choice of  empirical therapy more complicated. materials and methods: this single-center study aims to try and assess the influence of age on microbiology and antibiotic  sensitivity of organisms causing infection in patients with malignant disease. results: the five most common bacterial pathogens isolated were pseudomonas sp (245, 26.2%) > enterocococcus sp (109, 11.66%) > staphylococcus aureus (107, 11.44%) > escherichia coli (106, 11.34%) > klebsiella sp (99, 10.59%). there was  no significant change in the distribution of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with age. however, there was an increase in the occurrence of the enterobacteriacea group and a decrease in infections caused by nonlactose fermenters with increasing age. the esbl production increased from 10.52% (12-19  years) to 24.88% (> 50 years) as did oxacillin resistance (from 14.3% to 28.1%) among s. aureus isolates. the activity of most antimicrobial agents decreased with increasing age. the decreasing trend of activity was statistically significant for meropenam (73.3-41.2%) against pseudomonas sp. and for the activity of the aminoglycosides for acinetobacter sp (61.1-17.4% for amikacin). conclusions: this suggests that empirical antibiotic therapy needs to be changed  on the basis of the age of the patient. it also appears that combination therapy  is essential for the empirical treatment of infections in elderly patients with cancer.

TI  == eradication of bacteria in suspension and biofilms using methylene blue-loaded dynamic nanoplatforms.
AB  == the bacterial killing efficiency of a dynamic nanoplatform (dnp) was evaluated. the polyacrylamide (paa) hydrogel matrix of the dnp was loaded with methylene blue (mb) and was previously applied successfully to killing rat c6 glioma tumor  cells in culture. this series of experiments is aimed at determining the suitability of this nanoplatform for elimination of bacterial infections. suspended cultures of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, and acinetobacter sp. were exposed to activated ( approximately 650-nm laser light) mb-paa-dnps. the killing efficiency of nanoparticle mass concentration, light irradiance and fluence, and dark incubation time was determined on each of the bacterial species. moreover, the ability of activated mb-paa-dnps to inhibit biofilm growth and eradicate and disperse preformed biofilms, preformed on glass and polystyrene surfaces, was demonstrated. the data revealed that activated mb-paa-dnps eradicated all species of bacteria examined.  also, encapsulation of mb into the paa-dnp matrix significantly diminished the observed dark toxicity of free dye. the photobactericidal efficacy of mb-paa-dnp  was found to be higher for gram-positive bacteria than for gram-negative bacteria. in addition, activated mb-paa-dnp can inhibit biofilm growth and eradicate almost all of the early-age biofilms that are formed by all of the bacteria examined.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == [investigation of microbial colonization of computer keyboards used inside and outside hospital environments].
AB  == computers have been commonly used in daily life and at hospitals by medical staff. this study was carried out to search the microbial colonization of computer keyboards and mice used inside and outside hospital environments. keyboards and mice samples from a total of 398 computers were included to the study, in which 38 were used by doctors and nurses in the hospital clinics (group 1); 32 by the medical faculty students (group 2), and 328 by university students  (group 3) in the computer laboratories of selcuk university, konya (located at middle anatolia). of the computers, 96.7% (n:385) have been found to be colonized by coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 13.1% (n:52) by gram-positive spore-forming bacilli and 8.8% (n:35) by corynebacteria; followed by candida spp. (4.2%), gram-negative bacilli (1.7%) [acinetobacter spp. (n:4), pseudomonas sp. (n:l), klebsiella sp. (n:l), e. coli (n:1)], staphylococcus aureus (1.5%), and molds (penicillium, aspergillus; 1.2%). the isolation rates of cons were similar  between the groups (94,7%, 93.7%, and 97.2%, respectively). however it was noted  that all of the gram-negative bacterial isolates (7/38; 18.4%) were from the samples collected from hospital computers (group 1). susceptibility rates of cons isolates to cefoxitin were detected as 26.2% in group 1, 79.2% in group 2, and 91.3% in group 3. five out of six s. aureus strains were found susceptible to cefoxitin, except one isolated from a sample of group 1. linezolid resistance in  both cons and s. aureus isolates were not determined in any groups. as a result,  according to the data obtained from this study as well as from the other foreign  studies, the computer keyboards and mice which are widely used in the hospital settings, are being the source of potential cross contamination in the development of nosocomial infections. therefore the computers should be cleaned properly frequently and hand washing procedures and disinfection rules should be  obeyed after the use of computers before handling the patients.

TI  == the current state of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in north america.
AB  == although much of today's media focuses on multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, resistance within gram-negative bacilli continues to rise, occasionally creating situations in which few or no antibiotics that retain activity are available. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella sp are emerging threats nationally. although carbapenems are considered the antibiotic class of choice to treat esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, the ability of these organisms to produce carbapenemases has now become apparent in some regions throughout the united states. although still rare, klebsiella sp that produce kpc-2 retain susceptibility only to tigecycline, polymyxins, and occasionally aminoglycosides. multidrug resistance among pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp has always been apparent across many hospitals in the united states. recent surveillance indicates increasing resistance to all currently available antibiotics, including carbapenems, cephalosporins, penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides.  against many strains, only polymyxins retain activity; however, resistance has also been reported to these agents. fortunately, resistance mechanisms such as metallo-beta-lactamases are still rare in the united states. as no new antibiotics with novel mechanisms against many of these gram-negative bacilli are expected to be developed in the foreseeable future, careful and conservative use  of agents combined with good infection control practices is required.

TI  == five-year review of infections in a burn intensive care unit: high incidence of acinetobacter baumannii in a tropical climate.
AB  == a 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from june 2001 to may 2006 was carried out. all patients required intubation at some point, and icu support. data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. nosocomial infections (nis) were defined using standard cdc criteria. seventy-six patients were admitted during the study  period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 nis, with 240 nis/100 admissions. the most common ni was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). the device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. there were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. the most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=24) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). a. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). data from this and  other studies supports the hypothesis that a. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == background: nosocomial pneumonia (np) is the second most common hospital acquired infection. understanding the pattern of occurrence, risk factors and etiological  agents of np in a picu, is essential for developing effective infection control measures. this prospective observational study was conducted in a picu of a tertiary care teaching hospital, to determine the incidence, etiology and risk factors for np. materials and methods: patients admitted to the picu, over a period of 1 year who had endotracheal (et) intubation, were enrolled consecutively into the study. demographic details were recorded at the time of inclusion. diagnosis of np was based on cdc criteria (1988). semiquantiative assay of endotracheal aspirate (eta) with a colony count of > 10(5) cfu/ml was taken as evidence of infection. colonisation was defined as isolation of organism with <10(5) cfu/ml. age, nutritional status, number and duration of intubations,  duration of mechanical ventilation, sedation, nasogastric feeding were the risk factors studied for development of np. intubation attempts of more than one were  defined as reintubation. risk factors found significant on univariate analysis, were subjected to multiple regression analysis to determine the most important predictors of np. results: the study group comprised of 72 children with a median age of 3.7 years and boys: girls ratio of 1.9:1. twenty two of 72 (30.5%) developed np; the predominant isolates from eta were acinetobacter anitratus(12), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), klebsiella sp(3) and staphylococcus aureus and e.coli(1) each. additionally 18(39%) had evidence of et colonization, with acinetobacter sp being the commonest 9(50%). re-intubation, prolonged duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation were the significant risk factors on univariate analysis for development of np. on multiple regression analysis, reintubation was the only independent risk factor for np(or 0.72, 95%ci 0.55-0.94). overall mortality was 21%(15/72);7(47%)of these deaths were secondary to np. conclusions: np developed in nearly one third of the intubated patients; gram negative organisms were the predominant etiological agents and associated with high mortality. re-intubation, prolonged duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation were the significant risk factors on univariate analysis for development of np. on multiple regression analysis, reintubation was the only independent risk factor for np.

AB  == the aim of this cross-sectional retrospective study was to describe clinical and  functional characteristics and the microbiological profile of an adult population with cystic fibrosis. the study was performed at the pulmonary diseases service of the hospital of the medical school of the state university of campinas. the charts of 54 adults (27 males, 27 females) with cystic fibrosis were reviewed. demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were collected. clinical and functional characteristics of patients with chronic pseudomonas infection were compared with those without it. the mean age of the patients was 41.8 years and the mean sweat chloride concentration was 106.4 meq/l. forty-nine percent had chronic respiratory symptoms only after 18 years of age, and 85% reported chronic production of purulent sputum. six percent had diarrhea or fat in stools, and no  patient suffered from diabetes mellitus. pseudomonas was present in 48%, and 73%  of them had the mucoid strain. others agents found were staphylococcus aureus (28%), hemophylus sp. (34%), aspergillus sp. (22%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (9%), acinetobacter sp. (7%), and burkholderia cepacia (2%). nontuberculous mycobacteria were found in sputum from 9 patients (11%); 34 patients (67%) had obstructive ventilatory defect; and 47% had obstruction and restriction. concerning the groups with and without pseudomonas colonization, only the values  of sweat chloride were significantly higher in chronic colonized patients. less severe phenotypes of cystic fibrosis may be found among patients previously diagnosed as having bronchiectasis. chronic colonization with pseudomonas aeruginosa in this study was not associated with worse clinical status but colonized patients did show significantly higher levels of chloride in sweat.

TI  == bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface.
AB  == understanding of bacterial survival in aerosols is crucial for controlling infection transmission via airborne aerosols and/or large droplets routes. the cell viability changes of four bacteria species (escherichia coli k12 jm109; acinetobacter sp. 5a5; pseudomonas oleovorans x5; and staphylococcus aureus x8),  three gram-negative and one gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 microm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the live/dead baclight solution and a microscope. droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. all four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40-45 min. the final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. droplet evaporation over the first 35-40 min had no adverse  effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. the lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

AB  == ethanol extract of flowers of phrygilanthus acutifolius (ruiz & pav.) eichler (loranthaceae) inhibited the growth of both gram (+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram (-) bacteria (serratia marcescens, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa). this extract was bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus and bacteriostatic against pseudomonas aeruginosa. morphological evidence suggests that the extract  causes the swelling of the bacterial body of staphylococcus aureus, the disintegration of the cell surface and the cell death. bactericidal activity was  optimal at ph 7.5 and was not affected by different ionic strengths. the presence of mg2+ in the culture medium of phrygilanthus acutifolius diminished the sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against the extract. test results would tend to corroborate the folk belief that the flowers of this plant are efficacious against respiratory infections and would justify its further investigation.

TI  == [sequential microbiological monitoring of tracheal aspirates in intubated patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit].
AB  == objective: to evaluate, sequentially, tracheal aspirates from patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit and to associate these pathogens with length of hospital stay, previous use of antimicrobial therapy and diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia. methods: the study population consisted of patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, between november 2002 and december 2003, on ventilator support. three tracheal aspirates were collected serially from each patient. the first tracheal aspirate sample was obtained 6 hours after admission to the intensive care unit and the remaining samples were collected after 48 and 96 hours. results: one hundred patients aged from one day  to 14 years were assessed. positive tracheal cultures were observed to have increased in the three tracheal aspirate samples collected from each patient for  pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 6 to 22% (p = 0.002), and to have decreased for staphylococcus aureus, from 23 to 8% (p = 0.009). isolation of candida spp increased for the subset that had received previous antimicrobial therapy (p < 0.05). sixteen (23.5%) out of 68 patients admitted without pneumonia developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. positive tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained in 10 out of 16 of these patients: six were positive for staphylococcus  aureus (three associated with acinetobacter baumanii), two for klebsiella spp (one associated with enterobacter spp), one for pseudomonas aeruginosa and one for candida spp. conclusion: sequential evaluation of tracheal aspirates may be useful to track changes in bacterial flora at pediatric intensive care units.

TI  == [comparison of bactec and bact/alert systems in evaluation of blood cultures].
AB  == automatized blood culture systems are used widely due to the characteristics such as lower contamination risks, shorter incubation periods and higher isolation rates. in this study, bactec 9050 (becton dickinson, ireland) and bact/alert 120  (organon teknika corp, usa) systems were compared for the evaluation of blood cultures obtained from 222 hospitalized patients in intensive care units between  september and december 2003. for this purpose, two blood samples obtained from each arms of patients, were inoculated into bactec plus aerobic/f (becton dickinson, ireland) and bact/alert fa/aerobic (biomerieux, usa) media, respectively, and incubated. the first bacterial growth time has been recorded for each system and the bacteria were identified by conventional methods. as a result, both of the systems detected bacterial growth in 42 (91.3%) of a total of 46 (20.7%) positive blood samples obtained from 222 patients. the distribution of microorganisms grown in bactec and bact/alert were found as follows, respectively; 24 and 20 coagulase negative staphylococci, 8 and 8 acinetobacter sp., 6 and 10 escherichia coli, 1 and 1 staphylococcus aureus, 1 and 1 pseudomonas sp., 1 and 1 klebsiella sp., 1 and 1 candida sp. false positivity and false negativity were not observed in either of the systems. positive results were obtained in an average time of 20.6 (7.5-35.5) hours and 22.49 (1.5-35.5) hours with bactec and bact/alert, respectively. since there was no statistically  significant difference between the systems concerning bacterial isolation rates and periods (p=1.00), it may be concluded that both of these systems would be used in clinical microbiology laboratories for the evaluation of blood cultures.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == antibiotic resistance among nosocomial isolates in a croatian intensive care unit--results of a twelve-year focal surveillance of nosocomial infections.
AB  == continuous 12-year (1990--2001) focal surveillance of the antibiotic resistance among the most common nosocomial pathogens (klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus) in 1325 intensive care  unit patients was performed. the surveillance period was divided in three 4-year  time intervals (1990--1993, 1994--1997 and 1998--2001) and the prevalence of resistance was compared between intervals. specimens included blood, urine and respiratory tract specimens. the incidence and trends of resistance to six antibiotics showed inconsistent results. aminoglycoside resistance decreased among k. pneumoniae_isolates (gentamicin 83%, 72.7% and 49.6%; amikacin 50.9%, 51.5% and 18.2%) and acinetobacter sp. strains (amikacin 77%, 63.4% and 58.2%) but increased in p. aeruginosa (amikacin 27.5%, 63.3% and 44.1%). overall, resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem increased but imipenem resistance is still low, particularly among acinetobacter sp. isolates (0, 2.1% and 1.5%). however, imipenem resistance increased among p. aeruginosa (10.2%, 31.6%, 22.1%). the prevalence of methicillin resistance was high but did not change during the surveillance period (82.3%, 78.3% and 82.2%). the present study suggests a complex picture of the development of antibiotic resistance in a single icu. significant changes occur over time but they are unpredictable and do not show identical tendencies for different species and antibiotics.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

AB  == in this study, we aimed to determine the frequencies of catheter exit-site infection (cesi), catheter-related bloodstream infection (cr-bsi) and catheter colonization (cc); causative microorganisms; and resistance patterns in patients  with temporary hemodialysis catheters. from march 1999 to march 2000, 67 hemodialysis patients (38 males, 29 females; median age: 52, range: 17-84) were evaluated. the cdc criteria were used to diagnose cesi, cr-bsi and cc. the tips of catheters were cultured by maki's method. at the same time, two different blood cultures, one from peripheral vein and the other through the catheter lumen were drawn. swab cultures from the catheter exit sites were also performed. the isolation and identification of bacteria were performed by conventional methods and the susceptibility testing by the kirby-bauer method. cesi, cr-bsi and cc were found in, respectively, 20 (29.8%), 16 (23.8%) and 11 (16.4%) patients. the  etiologic agents in cr-bsi were as follows: staphylococcus aureus (5), coagulase-negative staphylococci (2), enterococcus sp. (1), escherichia coli (1), acinetobacter sp. (1) and proteus sp. (1). methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were found in proportions of 45.5% and 63.6% in cesi and cr-bsi+cc. the only risk factor for the development of cr-bsi and cc was intravenous drug use. in our center, the majority of cesi, cr-bsi and cc were due to staphylococci and there was a high rate of methicillin resistance.

TI  == sepsis in burned patients.
AB  == a prospective study was conducted from june 2001 to may 2002 at the burns unit of hospital regional da asa norte, brasilia, brazil. during the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the burns unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and  microbiologically proven sepsis. twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body  surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. these 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to candida sp. the most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae. eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. the primary  foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. the most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. the most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia,  leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. twelve (24.5%) patients died. the appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.

TI  == employment of broad-range 16s rrna pcr to detect aetiological agents of infection from clinical specimens in patients with acute meningitis--rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons without the need for cloning.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to develop a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) method for the rapid separation of 16s rrna pcr amplicons from aetiological agents of acute meningitis. methods and results: blood samples from  40 patients with suspected acute meningococcal meningitis were examined for the presence of causal agents, including neisseria meningitidis employing two methods: (i) broad-range 16s rrna pcr in conjunction with page and automated sequencing and (ii) species-specific pcr employing abi taqman technology for n. meningitidis. analysis of clinical specimens employing 16s rrna pcr yielded 33/40 (82.5%) positive for the presence of bacterial dna. species-specific pcr yielded  30/40 (75%) clinical specimens positive for n. meningitidis. prior to separation  by page, only 6/33 (18.2%) amplicons were able to be identified by sequence analysis, the remaining amplicons (n=27) did not yield an identification due to the presence of mixed 16s rrna pcr amplicons. following separation, amplicons were re-amplified and sequenced, yielding 24/27 (88.9%) positive for n. meningitidis and three specimens positive for acinetobacter sp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. one specimen was positive for both n. meningitidis and streptococcus spp. and another specimen was positive for n. meningitidis and pseudomonas sp., by broad-range pcr. seven clinical specimens were negative for n. meningitidis and other eubacteria using both detection techniques. conclusions: clinical specimens including blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, may become contaminated with commensal skin flora, resulting in difficulties in downstream sequencing of pathogen plus contaminant dna. this study allows for the rapid separation of amplified pathogen from contaminant dna. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrated the usefulness of the rapid separation of multiple 16s rrna pcr amplicons using a combination of page and automated sequencing, without the need of cloning. adoption of this technique is therefore proposed when trying to rapidly identify pathogens in clinical specimens employing broad-range 16s rrna pcr.

TI  == pathogen frequency and resistance patterns in brazilian hospitals: summary of results from three years of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: pathogen frequency and resistance patterns may vary significantly from country to country and also in different hospitals within a country. thus, regional surveillance programs are essential to guide empirical therapy and infection control measures. methods: rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections (bsi), lower  respiratory tract infections (lrti), wound or skin and soft tissue infections (wssti), and urinary tract infections (uti) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time, as part of the sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program (sentry). all isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution. results and conclusions: a total of 3,728 bacterial strains were obtained from january, 1997, to december, 1999, from 12 brazilian hospitals located in 4 states. the largest number of isolates were obtained from patients with bsi (2,008), followed by lrti (822 cases), uti (468 cases), and wssti (430 cases). staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen in general (22.8% - 852 isolates), followed by  e. coli (13.8% - 516 cases) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3% - 496 cases). staphylococcus aureus was also the most common species isolated from bsi (23.6%)  and wssti (45.8%), and p. aeruginosa was the most frequent species isolated from  patients with lrti (29.4%). the main bacterial resistance problems found in this  study were: imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa (69.8% susceptibility) and acinetobacter spp. (88.1% susceptibility); esbl production among k. pneumoniae (48.4%) and e. coli (8.9%); resistance to third generation cephalosporins among enterobacter spp. (68.1% susceptible to ceftazidime) and oxacillin resistance among s. aureus (34.0%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (80.1%). only the carbapenems (88.1% to 89.3% susceptibility) showed reasonable activity against the acinetobacter spp. isolates evaluated.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

AB  == of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from january 1995 to october 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). about 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). the site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. staphylococcus aureus (34%) was  the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but  not for late onset pneumonia. based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was  the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.

AB  == combining tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, with the ureidopenicillin, piperacillin, successfully restores the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing bacteria. thus, piperacillin/tazobactam is highly active against most clinically important species of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including anaerobes. we evaluated the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against clinical isolates from a tertiary university hospital located in sao paulo, brazil. its activity was compared to that of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, aztreonam, and imipenem against 820 isolates (608 gram-negative and 212 gram-positive) collected from hospitalized patients in 1999. the most frequent species tested were pseudomonas aeruginosa (168/20%), escherichia coli (139/17%), acinetobacter spp. (131/16%), and staphylococcus aureus (76/9%). of the isolates studied, 30% were from the bloodstream, 16% from  the lower respiratory tract, and 11% from surgical wounds or soft tissue. the isolates were susceptibility tested by the broth microdilution method according to nccls procedures. the isolates tested were highly resistant to most antimicrobial agents evaluated. imipenem resistance was not verified among enterobacteriaceae, and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active beta-lactams against this group of bacteria (80.0% susceptibility). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was very high among e. coli (approximately 20%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (approximately 40%). imipenem was uniformly active against these species (100% susceptibility) and piperacillin/tazobactam was the second most active compound inhibiting 84.4% of isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly resistant to all beta-lactams evaluated and piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active compound against this species. our results demonstrate an extremely high level of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital evaluated, especially among non-enteric gram-negative  bacilli. due to this high level of resistance, piperacillin/tazobactam represents an important contribution to the treatment of nosocomial infections.

TI  == incidence and susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units within a single hospital: implications for empiric antibiotic strategies.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to determine whether the incidence of recovery and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units (icus) in a single teaching hospital. methods: culture and susceptibility results were collected prospectively for a 3-month period (april through june 1999) in each of the surgical, trauma, and medical icus. the number of unique isolates and susceptibility patterns were determined.  susceptibility of isolates among icus was compared with chi2. results: statistically significant differences between icus in susceptibility to various antibiotics were found for staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus sp, acinetobacter  sp, enterobacter sp, klebsiella sp, and pseudomonas sp. notably, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was not seen in the medical icu, whereas it was seen in both the surgical and trauma icus. klebsiella spp resistant to ceftazidime were seen only in the trauma icu. the aminoglycosides and quinolones  had attenuated activity against pseudomonas sp in the surgical icu, whereas they  remained highly effective in the trauma icu. cefazolin had no activity against the enterobacter sp in either of the surgical icus, but was highly effective in the medical icu. conclusion: although the microbiologic results of this study should not be extrapolated to other institutions, the principle is of value. there is variability between icus in a single large teaching hospital in susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to various antibiotics. this may have implications in the design of empiric antibiotic strategies and the planning of the hospital formulary. hospital wide or composite icu antibiograms are inadequate for planning empiric therapy in the icu.

AB  == we reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in kandang kerbau hospital between 1st january 1993 to 31st december 1995. there were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. there were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases),  urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). one of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. there was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. we could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. the most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were acinetobacter baumanii (2), escherichia coli (1), klebsiella sp. (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (1), streptococcus group f (1), peptostreptococcus species and veillonella species (1). there was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful  recovery in all the cases.

TI  == effect of oral ciprofloxacin on bacterial flora of perineum, urethra, and lower urinary tract in men with spinal cord injury.
AB  == a study was performed in 25 men with spinal cord injuries undergoing intermittent catheterization whose urine had > or = 10(5) bacterial colonies/ml to determine efficacy of ciprofloxacin in eradicating susceptible organisms from urine, urethra, and perineum. cultures were obtained prior to, during, and 5 to 7 days after administration of 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. organisms in urine were also present in the urethra and/or perineum in 20 cases. susceptible bacteria disappeared from urine in all subjects; but at follow-up 12 had cultures positive for ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci, including 1 with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and 2 with ciprofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter sp. treatment significantly reduced gram-negative bacilli in perinea and urethras, but ciprofloxacin-susceptible organisms were replaced by resistant staphylococci, including mrsa, enterococci,  and acinetobacter sp. we support use of ciprofloxacin for treatment of urinary tract infections in persons with spinal cord injury, but in view of supercolonization with resistant organisms, the drug should be reserved for symptomatic persons not likely to respond to other oral agents.

TI  == effects of cytokines and endotoxin on the intracellular growth of bacteria.
AB  == patients with unresolving acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) have persistently elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs and circulation and increased rates of bacterial infections. phagocytic cells hyperactivated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), which induces high levels of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells, are inefficient in killing ingested bacteria despite having intact phagocytic activity. on the other hand, phagocytic cells that are activated with an analogue of lps that does not induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines effectively ingest and kill bacteria. we  hypothesized that in the presence of high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, bacteria may adapt and utilize cytokines to their growth advantage. to test our hypothesis, we primed a human monocytic cell line (u937) with escalating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), and il-6 and with lps. these cells were then exposed to fresh isolates of three common nosocomial pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an acinetobacter sp. in human monocytes primed with lower concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (10 to 250 pg) or lps (1 and 10 ng), intracellular bacterial growth decreased. however, when human  monocytes were primed with higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (1  to 10 ng) or lps (1 to 10 micrograms), intracellular growth of the tested bacteria increased significantly (p <0.0001). these results were reproduced with  peripheral blood monocytes obtained from normal healthy volunteers. the specificity of the cytokine activity was demonstrated by neutralizing the cytokines with specific antibodies. our findings provide a possible mechanism to  explain the frequent development of bacterial infections in patients with an intense and protracted inflammatory response.

TI  == hospital acquired infections in a singapore hospital: 1985-1992.
AB  == a prospective survey of hospital-acquired infections (hai) was conducted from 1985 to 1992. the survey used laboratory results to estimate incidence and alert  infection control staff to a need for further action. the results were analysed with regard to the site, speciality and type of organism. the distribution by speciality of patients who had methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus infections was compared with the distribution of all patients with hai. although  the surveillance was only partial, the data collected from year to year over the  period of study seemed constant. the distribution of infection by type, location  and bacterial cause was similar to results from other parts of the world. notable differences were the high incidence of acinetobacter sp., and the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used agents. over half the staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance problem in a university hospital.
AB  == in a study conducted in 1991 in the national university hospital, singapore, the  susceptibilities of a total of 2156 recent clinical isolates were tested against  25 antimicrobial drugs. the organisms were those isolated from routine specimens  received in the microbiology laboratory. about 40% staphylococcus aureus isolations in the hospital were resistant to methicillin. a high incidence of the resistance was noted among staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci to antistaphylococcal drugs. acinetobacter sp. and klebsiella sp. are becoming major threats with regard to antimicrobial treatment as they are multi-drug resistant. pseudomonas aeruginosa did not show a resistance problem except to pefloxacin (74%). ampicillin resistance of acinetobacter sp. (93%) was  reduced to 71% by ampicillin/clavulanic acid and to 7% by ampicillin/sulbactam. with regards to the urinary isolates higher rates of resistance were noticed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to antipseudomonas drugs and for co-trimoxazole with other gram negative organisms, compared to non-urinary isolates.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == in a prospective, randomized, controlled study, the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with those of ceftazidime in the treatment of tissue infections. a total of 52 patients received intravenous ciprofloxacin 200 mg twice daily (26 patients) or ceftazidime 1 to 2 g every eight to 12 hours  (26 patients). this was followed, respectively, by oral ciprofloxacin or another  suitable drug when improvement was seen. informed consent was obtained from all patients. cultures and laboratory determinations were performed initially and repeated periodically as indicated. both groups were comparable in age, sex, number of infected sites, and instance of nosocomial infections (27 total). severe infections occurred in six ciprofloxacin and 12 ceftazidime patients (p =  0.056). there were 13 patients in the ciprofloxacin group and six in the ceftazidime group with accompanying diseases (p = 0.032). patients were treated with ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime for infections of the urinary tract (eight and  two patients, respectively), skin or soft tissues (15 and 17 patients), pelvis (one and zero patients), lower respiratory tract (one and one patients), intra-abdominal (zero and three patients), and bacteremia (three and five patients). two patients in each group had two sites of infection. causative organisms were as follows: 15 gram-positive cocci (90 percent minimal inhibitory  concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.5; ceftazidime, 16.0 micrograms/ml) and 55 gram-negative rods (44 enterobacteriaceae, nine pseudomonas aeruginosa; 90 percent minimal inhibitory concentration: ciprofloxacin, 0.25; ceftazidime, 8.0 micrograms/ml). resistance emerged in one patient treated with ciprofloxacin (acinetobacter sp.) and 12 treated with ceftazidime (four enterococcus, two staphylococcus aureus, six other). intravenous treatment was longer with ceftazidime (11.5 days versus 5.6 days for the ciprofloxacin group, p less than 0.0005), but the total duration of therapy was similar (12.9 versus 14.1 days, p  value not significant). resolution or improvement occurred in 23 ciprofloxacin and 26 ceftazidime sites of infection (p value not significant). death occurred in two ceftazidime-treated patients (due to bacterial infection) and one ciprofloxacin-treated patient (at the induction of anesthesia). adverse experiences were more common in the ceftazidime group as compared with the ciprofloxacin group (22 versus 15 patients, p = 0.026). ciprofloxacin eradicated  25 of 31 causative organisms, whereas ceftazidime eradicated 30 of 41 (p value not significant). intravenous ciprofloxacin was at least as effective as ceftazidime. patients treated with ciprofloxacin may need added coverage for anaerobes, but the drug's excellent activity against nosocomial pathogens and its availability in oral form allow for an early change to oral therapy without compromising effectiveness coupled with added savings and convenience.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == adhesion of bacteria from mixed cell suspension to solid surfaces.
AB  == the attachment of four species of bacteria to solid surfaces was investigated to  determine whether the attachment of one species of bacterium could be influenced  by the presence of other attaching or attached species. three types of experiment were done: attachment of bacteria from suspensions containing two species (termed "simultaneous attachment") was compared to attachment of each species in pure culture, the attachment of one species of bacterium to surfaces already colonized by a second species (termed "sequential attachment") was compared to attachment of the bacteria to clean, uncolonized surfaces, and bacteria were allowed to attach to a surface already colonized by a second strain, and their effect on the stabilization of adhesion of the initial colonizing strain was determined. the bacteria were acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a staphylococcus sp., a coryneform (isolates from a canning factory), and staphylococcus aureus. the surfaces were tin plate, glass, and nylon. the attachment of each species was either increased, decreased or not affected by the simultaneous or sequential attachment of another species. the results depended upon the species combination, the surface composition, and the sequence of attachment. the detachment of a primary colonizing species was either increased, decreased or not affected by the subsequent attachment of a second species, depending on the species combination and surface. the results demonstrate that bacterial attachment to a surface can be influenced by the composition of the attaching population and can differ considerably from the attachment of the component species in pure culture.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nosocomial infections in a respiratory intensive care unit.
AB  == a total of 250 consecutive admissions to an open-plan respiratory icu were analyzed prospectively to identify the incidence of secondary hospital-acquired infections and possible predisposing factors. despite preventative measures and a restricted antibiotic policy, 23.6% of patients developed secondary infections. patients admitted after multiple trauma were the only diagnostic category of patients who showed a significantly increased incidence of secondary infections.  the length of hospitalization and number of patients who had intubations or tracheostomies was higher in the group with secondary infection; the causal relationship was difficult to establish. patients who were not intubated or tracheostomized did not develop secondary infection. prior administration of antibiotics did not appear to influence the incidence of secondary infection. there was a significant increase in secondary infections in patients with a higher therapeutic intervention scoring system score. the predominant pathogens cultured were highly resistant gram-negative organisms, particularly acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas sp. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram-positive pathogen. the icu course was probably prolonged by the complication of nosocomial infection, which may have contributed to the deaths.

AB  == aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. from 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (g-1, g-2, g-3 and g-4). similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. the identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group d streptococci were found for each of those sites. the majority of the interfering  isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only  simultaneous antagonism. to complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (g-7, g-9, g-10 and g-11). this spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. while the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the gram positive cocci and the acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. gonococcal strains g-7 and g-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain g-3 was the most resistant one.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  == cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. this study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc). cefoperazone was highly active against enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive proteus, serratia and  enterobacter sp. particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. the activity of cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci and haemophilus was also determined. in general, the differences between mic and mbc  were minimal. additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.

TI  == differential toxicities of mercury to bacteria and bacteriophages in sea and in lake water.
AB  == mixtures of anionic hgcl3-/hgcl4(2)-complexes were less toxic to terrestrial bacteria (erwinia herbicola, agrobacterium tumefaciens), to marine bacteria (acinetobacter sp., aeromonas sp.), and to bacteriophages (phi 11 m 15 of staphylococcus aureus and p1 of escherichia coli) than were equivalent concentrations of hg as cationic hg2+. the toxicity of 1 ppm hg to a. tumefaciens. aeromonas sp., and phi 11 m 15 was less in seawater than in lake water. inasmuch as the hg-cl species are formed in environments of high chloride  concentration, it was postulated that the lower toxicity of hg in seawater was a  result of the formation of hgcl3-/hgcl4(2)-complexes.

TI  == rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test using tetrazolium reduction.
AB  == a rapid method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been developed, which  uses a modified microdilution procedure and an inoculum of 10(7) bacteria per ml. results are determined within 4 h with an indicator consisting of 2(p-iodophenyl)-3(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride. the precipitation  of a red formazan by bacteria uninhibited by antimicrobials is accelerated by the addition of phenazine methosulfate. isolates are classified as resistant, indeterminate, or susceptible, based on growth in up to two antimicrobial concentrations which conform closely to concentrations which correlate with the millimeter breakpoints used in the bauer-kirby method. results of testing 10 antimicrobial agents against 1,126 isolates were compared with results obtained when the bauer-kirby method and the agar dilution procedure were used as reference methods. enterococci were excluded because of false resistance. discrepancies were classified as very major (false susceptibility), major (false  resistance), and minor (combinations of susceptibility or resistance with indeterminate results). the rapid method versus the agar dilution method yielded  2.3% very major, 0.7% major, and 2.9% minor discrepancies, for a total of 6.0%. of 58 organism-antimicrobial agent combinations tested, 23 displayed 1% very major discrepancies between the rapid method and the agar dilution method. six were not therapeutically important. the remainder involved staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter sp., and most organisms tested with chloramphenicol. it is suggested that adjustments in antibiotic concentrations and/or inoculum size may eliminate these discrepancies. the rapid method appeared economical when compared with autobac 1 and the bauer-kirby procedure.
