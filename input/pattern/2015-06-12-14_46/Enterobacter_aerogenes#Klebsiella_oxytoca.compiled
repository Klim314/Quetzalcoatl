TI  - Predominance of KPC-3 in a Survey for Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae  in Portugal.
AB  - Among the 2,105 Enterobacteriaceae tested in a survey done in Portugal, 165 were  nonsusceptible to carbapenems, from which 35 (26 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 2 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 3 Enterobacter cloacae isolates and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate) were confirmed to be carbapenemase producers by the presence of 30 Tn4401d-blaKPC-3, 4 intI3-blaGES-5, and one intI1-blaVIM-2 gene, alone or in combination with other bla genes. The dissemination of blaKPC-3 gene carried by an IncF plasmid suggests lateral gene transfer as a major mechanism of dissemination.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility and distribution of beta-lactamases in Enterobacteriaceae causing intra-abdominal infections in North America 2010-2011.
AB  - The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends has been monitoring the  activity of antimicrobials indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections since 2004. This report documents the in vitro activity of several recommended antimicrobials against 3449 gram-negative bacilli isolated from the 30 and 25 participating sites in North America in 2010-2011, respectively, and characterizes the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) identified in ESBL-positive and ertapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morgannii were the most common species isolated. The incidence of beta-lactamase production was 8.8% and 8.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Overall the most active antimicrobials were amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and ertapenem, although beta-lactamase production reduced the activity of most agents. Characterization of beta-lactamase genes determined that bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(AmpC), and bla(KPC) were commonly found in most beta-lactamase-positive isolates.
TI  - Molecular characterization of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in northern Portugal.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) prevalence was studied in the north of  Portugal, among 193 clinical isolates belonging to citizens in a district in the boundaries between this country and Spain from a total of 7529 clinical strains. In the present study we recovered some members of Enterobacteriaceae family, producing ESBL enzymes, including Escherichia coli (67.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.6%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.5%), and Citrobacter freundii (0.5%). beta -lactamases genes blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing approaches. TEM enzymes were among the most prevalent types (40.9%) followed by CTX-M (37.3%) and SHV (23.3%). Among our sample of 193 ESBL-producing strains 99.0% were resistant to the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Of the 193 isolates 81.3% presented transferable plasmids harboring bla ESBL genes. Clonal studies were performed by PCR for the enterobacterial repetitive intragenic consensus (ERIC) sequences. This study reports a high diversity of genetic patterns. Ten clusters were found for E. coli isolates and five clusters for K. pneumoniae strains by means of ERIC analysis. In conclusion, in this country, the most prevalent type is still the TEM-type, but CTX-M is growing rapidly.
TI  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain: high percentage of colistin resistance among VIM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 isolates.
AB  - Here we describe the carbapenemase genes, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility data of 123 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) clinical isolates recovered from 2010 to 2012, comprising Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 79), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 13), Serratia marcescens (n = 14), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 12), Enterobacter asburiae (n = 4) and Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1). VIM-1 was the most common carbapenemase (n = 101) followed by KPC-2 (n = 19), OXA-48 (n = 2) and IMP-22 (n = 1). Among the K. pneumoniae isolates, nine sequence types (STs) were identified but two clones were dominant: ST11 (54/79) containing mainly VIM-1-producing isolates; and ST101 (13/79) constituted by KPC-2-producing strains. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed a higher genetic diversity among the remaining Enterobacteriaceae. Amikacin and fosfomycin were the most active agents with 82.9% and 80.5% susceptibility, respectively. Non-susceptibility to tigecycline was detected in 36.5% of strains. Overall, colistin resistance was 24.7% and was as high as 47% in Enterobacter spp. An increase in colistin resistance from 13.5% to 31.7% was observed among K. pneumoniae isolates during the study period. Resistance was focused on ST11 since 83.3% of colistin-resistant strains belonged to this clone. The high level of colistin resistance observed in this study is worrying with respect to the already limited therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Emergence of Carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella Pneumoniae of Sequence type 258 in Michigan, USA.
AB  - The prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in our hospital increased beginning in 2009. We aimed to study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of these emerging isolates. We performed a retrospective review of all adult patients with clinical cultures confirmed as CPE by positive modified Hodge test from 5/2009- 5/2010 at the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS). Clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. Available CPE isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA encoding gene and bla KPC locus. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Twenty six unique CPE isolates were obtained from 25 adult patients. The majority were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=17). Other isolates included K. oxytoca (n=3), Citrobacter freundii (n=2), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=1) and Escherichia coli (n=1). Molecular characterization of 19 available CPE isolates showed that 13 (68%) carried the KPC-3 allele and 6 (32%) carried the KPC-2 allele. Among 14 available K. pneumoniae strains, 12 (86%) carried the KPC-3 allele and belonged to a common lineage, sequence type (ST) 258. The other 2 (14%) K. pneumoniae isolates carried the KPC-2 allele and belonged to two unique STs. Among these ST 258 strains, 67% were isolated from patients with prior exposures to health care settings outside of our institution. In contrast, all CPE isolates carrying the KPC-2 allele and all non ST 258 CPE isolates had acquisition attributable to our hospital. Molecular epidemiology of carbapenemase producing K. pneumoniae suggests that KPC-3 producing K. pneumoniae isolates of a common lineage, sequence type (ST 258), are emerging in our hospital. While ST 258 is a dominant sequence type throughout the United States, this study is the first to report its presence in Michigan.
TI  - Characterization of KPC-2-producing Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates from a Chinese Hospital.
AB  - Twelve nonduplicated KPC-2-producing enterobacterial isolates, including three Escherichia coli, two Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae, four Enterobacter aerogenes, and one Klebsiella oxytoca, were collected from various clinical samples within 18 months (March 2011 to September 2012). Two of the 12 patients died from infections caused by KPC-2-producing pathogens, while the rest of the patients with KPC-2-producing pathogens improved or were cured. The majority of the clinical isolates exhibited a high-level of resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and carbapenems, and possessed self-transferable bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmids with sizes ranging from 20 to 120 kb. Most isolates carried bla(CTX-M) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, while some isolates produced 16S rRNA methylases (ArmA or RmtB). The genetic environment of bla(KPC-2) of most clinical strains was consistent with the genetic structure surrounding bla(KPC-2) on the plasmid pKP048, which contains an integration structure of a Tn3-based transposon and partial Tn4401 segment. Inserted fragments (truncated bla(TEM)) were detected upstream of the bla(KPC-2) gene for two E. aerogenes strains. In conclusion, the enterobacterial isolates exhibited sporadic emergence and did not arise by clonal spread at our hospital. The outcome of infections caused by KPC-producing enterobacterial isolates and their mortality were closely associated with the baseline condition of patients. The spread of bla(KPC-2) gene between different enterobacterial species in China was mainly mediated by horizontal transfer of the Tn3-based transposons and not the bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmids.
TI  - Enterobacter and Klebsiella species isolated from fresh vegetables marketed in Valencia (Spain) and their clinically relevant resistances to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - Occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic or commensal enterobacteria in marketed agricultural foodstuffs may contribute to their incorporation into the food chain and constitutes an additional food safety concern. In this work, we have determined the clinically relevant resistances to 11 common chemotherapeutic agents in Enterobacter and Klebsiella isolates from fresh vegetables from various sources (supermarkets and greengrocers' shops in Valencia, Spain). A total of 96 isolates were obtained from 160 vegetables analyzed (50% positive samples): 68 Enterobacter isolates (59 E. cloacae, two E. aerogenes, two E. cancerogenus, one E. gergoviae, and four E. sakazakii, currently Cronobacter spp.), and 28 Klebsiella isolates (19 K. oxytoca and 9 K. pneumoniae). Only seven isolates were susceptible to all agents tested, and no resistances to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were detected. Most isolates were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (74 [58 Enterobacter and 16 Klebsiella]) or to ampicillin (80 [55/25]). Other resistances were less frequent: nitrofurantoin (13 isolates [12/1]), tetracycline (6 [5/1]), co-trimoxazole (3 [3/0]), cefotaxime (1 [1/0]), and streptomycin (2 [1/1]). Multiresistant isolates to two (56 [41/15]), three (10 E. cloacae isolates), four (one E. cloacae and one K. pneumoniae isolate), and five (two E. cloacae isolates) chemotherapeutic agents were also detected. The presence of potential pathogens points to marketed fresh produce, which often is eaten raw, as a risk factor for consumer health. In addition, these results support the usefulness of these bacterial species as indicators of the spreading of antibiotic resistances into the environment, particularly in the food chain, and suggest their role as carriers of resistance determinants from farms to consumers, which may constitute an additional "silent" food safety concern. Therefore, there is a need to improve the hygienic quality of marketed fresh vegetables, from better methods to prevent contamination in the farms to the use of sanitizing practices at home.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Identification of Enterobacteriaceae by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the VITEK MS system.
AB  - This multicenter study evaluated the accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry identifications from the VITEK MS system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) for Enterobacteriaceae typically encountered in the clinical laboratory. Enterobacteriaceae isolates (n = 965) representing 17 genera and 40 species were analyzed on the VITEK MS system (database v2.0), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Colony growth (</=72 h) was applied directly to the target slide. Matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry before mass spectrometry analysis. On the basis of the confidence level, the VITEK MS system provided a species, genus only, or no identification for each isolate. The accuracy of the mass spectrometric identification was compared to 16S rRNA gene sequencing performed at MIDI Labs (Newark, DE). Supplemental phenotypic testing was performed at bioMerieux when necessary. The VITEK MS result agreed with the reference method identification for 96.7% of the 965 isolates tested, with 83.8% correct to the species level and 12.8% limited to a genus-level identification. There was no identification for 1.7% of the isolates. The VITEK MS system misidentified 7 isolates (0.7 %) as different genera. Three Pantoea agglomerans isolates were misidentified as Enterobacter spp. and single isolates of Enterobacter cancerogenus, Escherichia hermannii, Hafnia alvei, and Raoultella ornithinolytica were misidentified as Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter koseri, Obesumbacterium proteus, and Enterobacter aerogenes, respectively. Eight isolates (0.8 %) were misidentified as a different species in the correct genus. The VITEK MS system provides reliable mass spectrometric identifications for Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Distribution of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia-Pacific region: results of the study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART).
AB  - The increasing trend of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a worldwide threat. Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing intra-abdominal infections (IAI) from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) collected in 2008 and 2009 from the Asia-Pacific region were investigated. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. A total of 699 Enterobacteriaceae isolates with positive genotypic results, included Escherichia coli (n = 443), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 187), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 45), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 9), Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2), Morganella morganii (n = 2), and one each of Enterobacter asburiae, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri were analyzed. Nearly 20% of these beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were from community-associated IAI. CTX-M (588 isolates, including 428 [72.8%] with CTX-M-15) was the most common ESBL, followed by SHV (n = 59) and TEM (n = 4). CMY (n = 110, including 102 [92.7%] with CMY-2) was the most common AmpC beta-lactamase, followed by DHA (n = 46) and ACT/MIR (n = 40). NDM (n = 65, including 62 [95.4%] with NDM-1) was the most common carbapenemase, followed by IMP (n = 7) and OXA (n = 7). Isolates from hospital-associated IAI had more complicated beta-lactamase combinations than isolates from the community. Carbapenemases were all exclusively detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from India, except that IMP beta-lactamases were also detected in Philippines and Australia. CTX-M beta-lactamases were the predominant ESBLs produced by Enterobacteriaceae causing IAI in the Asia-Pacific region. Emergence of CTX-M-15-, CMY-2-, and NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates is of major concern and highlights the need for further surveillance in this area.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Klebsiella michiganensis sp. nov., a new bacterium isolated from a tooth brush holder.
AB  - Isolate W14(T) recovered from a household tooth brush holder was found to be gram-negative, a facultative anaerobic, non-motile, capsulated, and a non-endospore-forming straight rod. Based on phylogenetic analysis with 16S rRNA gene sequence, isolate W14(T) was affiliated to the genus Klebsiella. The closest phylogenetic relative was K. oxytoca with 99 % similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The major whole-cell fatty acids were C(16:0) (31.23 %), C(18:1omega6c)/C(18:1omega7c) (21.10 %), and C(16:1omega7c)/C(16:1omega6c) (19.05 %). The sequence similarities of isolate W14(T) based on rpoB, gyrA, and gyrB were 97, 98, and 98 % with K. oxytoca, and 97, 93, and 90 % with K. mobilis (=Enterobacter aerogenes), respectively. The ribotyping pattern showed a 0.46 similarity with K. oxytoca ATCC 13182(T) and 0.24 with K. mobilis ATCC 13048(T). The DNA G+C content of isolate W14(T) was 54.6 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness was 55.7 % with K. oxytoca ATCC 13182(T). Using the identification technology of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the top matches for this isolate were K. oxytoca ATCC 13182(T) (Match Factor Score 1.998) and K. mobilis (Score 1.797). On the basis of phenotypic, biochemical, chemotaxonomic, and molecular studies, isolate W14(T) could be differentiated from other members of the genus Klebsiella including K. mobilis. Therefore, it is proposed that isolate W14(T) (=ATCC BAA-2403(T)=DSM 25444(T)) should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Klebsiella, K. michiganensis sp. nov.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates to tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the in vitro susceptibility of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDRE) isolates to tigecycline. METHODS: Clinical isolates of MDRE tested in this study were obtained from 91 hospitals in Belgium during the period January 2010 to April 2010. MICs of tigecycline were determined by Vitek 2 (VTK) and by the reference broth microdilution (BMD) method, and the results were interpreted based on the 2011 MIC interpretative criteria recommended by EUCAST. RESULTS: A total of 501 non-duplicate MDRE isolates were tested. These comprised 284 isolates of Escherichia coli [255 (89.7%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates], 72 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae [53 (73.6%) were ESBL-producing isolates], 72 isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33 isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, 19 isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca and 21 miscellaneous others. The MIC(90) values of tigecycline for E. coli and non-E. coli ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were 0.5 and 2 mg/L by BMD, and 0.5 and 8 mg/L by VTK, respectively. The highest essential and categorical agreement rates between VTK and BMD results using EUCAST breakpoints were observed in E. coli isolates (97.2%), while lower and unacceptable essential and categorical agreement rates were obtained for isolates belonging to species other than E. coli (81.1% and 59.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: VTK appears to be a suitable method for routine susceptibility testing of tigecycline only for E. coli isolates, while BMD should be preferred for other Enterobacteriaceae species isolates.
TI  - Production of 2,3-butanediol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by in silico aided metabolic engineering.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 2,3-Butanediol is a chemical compound of increasing interest due to its wide applications. It can be synthesized via mixed acid fermentation of pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella oxytoca. The non-pathogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses three different 2,3-butanediol biosynthetic pathways, but produces minute amount of 2,3-butanediol. Hence, we attempted to engineer S. cerevisiae strain to enhance 2,3-butanediol production. RESULTS: We first identified gene deletion strategy by performing in silico genome-scale metabolic analysis. Based on the best in silico strategy, in which disruption of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway is required, we then constructed gene deletion mutant strains and performed batch cultivation of the strains. Deletion of three ADH genes, ADH1, ADH3 and ADH5, increased 2,3-butanediol production by 55-fold under microaerobic condition. However, overproduction of glycerol was observed in this triple deletion strain. Additional rational design to reduce glycerol production by GPD2 deletion altered the carbon fluxes back to ethanol and significantly reduced 2,3-butanediol production. Deletion of ALD6 reduced acetate production in strains lacking major ADH isozymes, but it did not favor 2,3-butanediol production. Finally, we introduced 2,3-butanediol biosynthetic pathway from Bacillus subtilis and E. aerogenes to the engineered strain and successfully increased titer and yield. Highest 2,3-butanediol titer (2.29 . l-1) and yield (0.113 g . g-1) were achieved by Deltaadh1 Deltaadh3 Deltaadh5 strain under anaerobic condition. CONCLUSIONS: With the aid of in silico metabolic engineering, we have successfully designed and constructed S. cerevisiae strains with improved 2,3-butanediol production.
TI  - Genotypic characterization and in vitro activities of tigecycline and polymyxin B for members of the Enterobacteriaceae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems.
AB  - Carbapenem resistance in members of the Enterobacteriaceae is increasing. To evaluate the effects of tigecycline and polymyxin B against carbapenem-non-susceptible pathogens, 89 representative clinical carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from seven hospitals from four cities in China during 2006-2009: 30 Serratia marcescens, 35 Klebsiella pneumoniae, seven Enterobacter cloacae, six Enterobacter aerogenes, five Escherichia coli, four Citrobacter freundii and two Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Twenty-eight S. marcescens isolates were indistinguishable. The 35 K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to 12 clonal strains. Among the 89 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 82 produced KPC-2, seven produced IMP (three produced KPC-2 simultaneously), three did not produce any carbapenemases and nine were deficient in porins. Polymyxin B was much more active than tigecycline against carbapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 8 and 32 microg ml(-1), 16 and 128 microg ml(-1), 0.5 and 16 microg ml(-1), and 4 and 16 microg ml(-1), respectively. Rates of susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem and polymyxin B were 30.0%, 27.5%, 2.5% and 89.2% by CLSI criteria. The rate of susceptibility to tigecycline was 40% and 17.5% by Food and Drug Administration (MIC </=2 microg ml(-1)) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (MIC </=1 microg ml(-1)) criteria, respectively. KPC-2- or IMP-producing E. coli transconjugants exhibited reduced susceptibility to carbapenems but were susceptible to polymyxin B and tigecycline with an MIC range of 0.5-2 microg ml(-1), 0.25-2 microg ml(-1), 0.5-4 microg ml(-1), 0.5 microg ml(-1) and 0.5-1 microg ml(-1). In conclusion, carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to production of KPC-2, and polymyxin B is active for the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. Intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. However, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. The benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. This study was performed to evaluate the interaction between Lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. RESULTS: Strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in McConkey Agar and identified using PCR with species-specific primers, and the BBL Enterotube II system for Enterobacteriaceae. Gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. The average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) CFU/g of faeces (p = 0.015). The following strains were identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis. Then, 27 Lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that two out of 27 strains of Lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. Our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which Lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
TI  - The activity of antimicrobial peptide S-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the activity of S-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. The result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of S-thanatin against all isolates of the Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all MICs to Gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except Enterococcus faecium. S-thanatin was more effective toward Gram-negative strains, especially for Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The MICs of S-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (P>0.05). Likewise, no notable difference could be observed between E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, K. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to S-thanatin (P>0.05). It was implied that the antimicrobial activity of S-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of (GTG)5-oligonucleotide and ribosomal intergenic transcribed spacer  (ITS)-PCR for molecular typing of Klebsiella isolates.
AB  - Molecular typing of Klebsiella species has become important for monitoring dissemination of beta-lactamase-producers in hospital environments. The present study was designed to evaluate poly-trinucleotide (GTG)(5)- and rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS)-PCR fingerprint analysis for typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates. Multiple displacement amplified DNA derived from 19 K. pneumoniae (some with an ESBL-phenotype), 35 K. oxytoca isolates, five K. pneumoniae, two K. oxytoca, three Raoultella, and one Enterobacter aerogenes type and reference strains underwent (GTG)(5) and ITS-PCR analysis. Dendrograms were constructed using cosine coefficient and the Neighbour joining method. (GTG)(5) and ITS-PCR analysis revealed that K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca isolates, reference and type strains formed distinct cluster groups, and tentative subclusters could be established. We conclude that (GTG)(5) and ITS-PCR analysis combined with automated capillary electrophoresis provides promising tools for molecular typing of Klebsiella isolates.
TI  - [Clinical assessment of novel ChromID ESBL agar plates for detection of ESBL producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae].
AB  - Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producers in the family Enterobacteriaceae are recognized worldwide as nosocomial pathogens, however it is difficult to screen them in the routine laboratory processing. ChromID ESBL agar newly developed for screening ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was released in Japan in April, 2007. We evaluated the clinical assessment of ChromID ESBL agar in routine microbiology laboratory. The 47 strains investigated were clinical isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae with the MICs of cefpodoxime greater than 2 mug/ml. The 27 ESBL-producers examined were comprising of 19 Escherichia coli, 3 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 3 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 S. marcescens (ESBL group) and 20 ESBL non-producers consiating of 5 K. oxytoca, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 P. vlugaris, 2 Serratia marcescens, 8 C. freundii, 2 Enterobacter cloacae, and 1 E. aerogenes (non-ESBL group). Characterization of beta-lactamase genes was carried out by use of polymerase chain reaction. As the results, the sensitivity and the specificity of ChromID ESBL agar plates after incubation for 18 hours was 100% and 20%, respectively. It should be noted that the values of specificity was extremely low compared with those of the sensitivity. These findings clearly suggested that in cases of utilizing ChromID ESBL agar plates, it should be important to consider its characteristic properties, as even the ESBL-non-producers could grow on these media only when they were resistant to CPDX.
TI  - Metallo-beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae from routine samples in an Italian tertiary-care hospital and long-term care facilities during 2008.
AB  - The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is a serious public health concern. Producers have been repeatedly isolated from patients and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents around Bolzano, and we sought to assess their prevalence and clinical impact. All routine Enterobacteriaceae isolates from a Bolzano tertiary-care hospital and associated long-term care facilities in 2008 (n = 5500) were screened for MBLs, with case details reviewed for the source patients. In total, 36 producers were obtained from 29 patients, comprising 14 Escherichia coli, six Klebsiella pneumoniae, four Klebsiella oxytoca, four Citrobacter freundii, two Enterobacter cloacae and two Morganella morganii, as well as single Citrobacter amalonaticus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia stuartii and Proteus mirabilis isolates. All were PCR-positive for bla(VIM) and 25 were PCR-positive for qnrS; 19 non-K. pneumoniae had bla(SHV) and one had bla(CTX-M-group1); 13 were from 12 LTCF residents and 23 were from 17 acute-care patients. All these patients had serious underlying diseases with prolonged hospitalization or LTCF stay; only seven had infections due to the MBL producers, comprising four urinary tract infections, two catheter-related bloodstream infections and one patient with both a surgical site infection and pneumonia. Five patients had more than one MBL-producing organism. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified a cluster of six related E. coli, whereas pairs of K. pneumoniae and C. freundii isolates had >85% profile similarity. Transformants prepared from two isolates were shown to be PCR-positive for bla(VIM), qnrS and bla(SHV); their plasmids gave similar restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns, and bla(VIM-1), qnrS1 and bla(SHV-12) were detected by sequencing.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from blood in Jakarta from 2002 to 2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream to antimicrobials with the aim of providing information relevant to the guidance of therapy. METHODOLOGY: Blood specimens received by the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, from 2002 to 2008, were analyzed for the presence of Gram-negative bacteria and their susceptibility to four antibiotic groups frequently administered in hospitals and community settings. RESULTS: During the seven-year period leading up to 2008, approximately 68% of Gram-negative bacteria were identified among all positive isolates from blood specimens. The eight most frequent species found were Acinetobacter anitratus (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (14.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (8%), Salmonella Typhi (7.5%), Escherichia coli (6.2%), Alcaligenes faecalis (5.6%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.2%). At 80% susceptibility or greater, Ceftriaxone and Cefotaxime were active only on E. coli and S. Typhi. Cefepime demonstrated activity on all eight species tested except K. pneumonia while Amikacin showed activity against five species, A. faecalis, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and S. Typhi. Gentamycin was active against three species: E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and S. Typhi. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin significantly differed in their spectrum: while Ciprofloxacin was active against four of the eight species tested (E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and S. Typhi ), Levofloxacin was similar to Cefepime and was active against all eight species except K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Since antimicrobials are broadly used in Jakarta, it is important that the information captured in this study be disseminated.
TI  - International spread and persistence of TEM-24 is caused by the confluence of highly penetrating enterobacteriaceae clones and an IncA/C2 plasmid containing Tn1696::Tn1 and IS5075-Tn21.
AB  - TEM-24 remains one of the most widespread TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae. To analyze the reasons influencing its spread and persistence, a multilevel population genetics study was carried out on 28 representative TEM-24 producers from Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain (13 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, 6 Escherichia coli isolates, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 2 Proteus mirabilis isolates, and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, from 1998 to 2004). Clonal relatedness (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and E. coli phylogroups) and antibiotic susceptibility were determined by standard procedures. Plasmid analysis included determination of the incompatibility group (by PCR, hybridization, and/or sequencing) and comparison of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns. Characterization of genetic elements conferring antibiotic resistance included integrons (classes 1, 2, and 3) and transposons (Tn3, Tn21, and Tn402). Similar PFGE patterns were identified among E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, while E. coli strains were diverse (phylogenetic groups A, B2, and D). Highly related 180-kb IncA/C2 plasmids conferring resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides were identified. Each plasmid contained defective In0-Tn402 (dfrA1-aadA1, aacA4, or aacA4-aacC1-orfE-aadA2-cmlA1) and In4-Tn402 (aacA4 or dfrA1-aadA1) variants. These integrons were located within Tn21, Tn1696, or hybrids of these transposons, with IS5075 interrupting their IRtnp and IRmer. In all cases, blaTEM-24 was part of an IS5075-DeltaTn1 transposon within tnp1696, mimicking other genetic elements containing blaTEM-2 and blaTEM-3 variants. The international dissemination of TEM-24 is fuelled by an IncA/C2 plasmid acquired by different enterobacterial clones which seem to evolve by gaining diverse genetic elements. This work highlights the risks of a confluence between highly penetrating clones and highly promiscuous plasmids in the spread of antibiotic resistance, and it contributes to the elucidation of the origin and evolution of TEM-2 ESBL derivatives.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a public hospital in Brazil.
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in enterobacteria are recognized worldwide as a great hospital problem. In this study, 127 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated in one year from inpatients and outpatients at a public teaching hospital at Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to analysis by PCR with specific primers for bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M genes. From the 127 isolates, 96 (75.6%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (9.3%) Escherichia coli, 8 (6.2%) Morganella morganii, 3 (2.3%) Proteus mirabilis, 2 (1.6%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 (1.6%) Providencia rettgeri, 2 (1.6%) Providencia stuartti, 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter aerogenes and 1 (0.8%) Enterobacter cloacae were identified as ESBL producers. Bla SHV, bla TEM and bla CTX-M were detected in 63%, 17.3% and 33.9% strains, respectively. Pulsed field gel eletrophoresis genotyping of K. pneumoniae revealed four main molecular patterns and 29 unrelated profiles. PCR results showed a high variety of ESBL groups among strains, in nine different species. The results suggest the spread of resistance genes among genetically different strains of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in some hospital wards, and also that some strongly related strains were identified in different hospital wards, suggesting clonal spread in the institutional environment.
TI  - Use of boronic acid disk tests to detect extended- spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of KPC carbapenemase-possessing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - We evaluated boronic acid (BA)-based methods for their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among clinical isolates of KPC-producing members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. A total of 155 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 141), Escherichia coli (n = 6), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 6), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) genotypically confirmed to be KPC producers were analyzed. As many as 118 isolates harbored ESBLs (103 harbored SHV-type ESBLs, 13 harbored CTX-M-type ESBLs, and 2 harbored both SHV- and CTX-M-type ESBLs); the remaining 37 isolates were genotypically negative for ESBL production. The CLSI ESBL confirmatory test was positive for 79 of the 118 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 66.9%), while all 37 non-ESBL producers were negative (specificity, 100%). When a > or =5-mm increase in the zone diameter of either the cefotaxime (CTX)-clavulanate (CA) or the ceftazidime (CAZ)-CA disks containing BA compared with the zone diameter of the CTX or CAZ disks containing BA was considered to be a positive result for ESBL production, the method detected all 118 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 100%) and showed no false-positive results for non-ESBL producers (specificity, 100%). Double-disk synergy tests, in which disks of CTX, CAZ, aztreonam, or cefepime in combination with BA were placed at distances of 20, 25, and 30 mm (center to center) from a disk containing amoxicillin (amoxicilline)-clavulanate-BA, were able to detect 116 (98.3%), 101 (85.6%), and 28 (23.7%) of the ESBL-positive isolates, respectively; no false-positive results for non-ESBL-producing isolates were detected. Our results demonstrate that the modified CLSI ESBL confirmatory test with antibiotic disks containing BA is the most accurate phenotypic method for the detection of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae producing KPC carbapenemases.
TI  - Molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. STUDY DESIGN: We isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed infants, identified using PCR with species-specific primers, strain-specific Automated Ribotyping and the API-50E kit for Enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. RESULTS: Coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log(10) CFU/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. The counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for E. coli: median 6.30 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log(10) CFU/g faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. Coliform bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. Our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic.
TI  - Role of TolC in Klebsiella oxytoca resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Gram-negative human pathogen Klebsiella oxytoca is often resistant to several antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and others. The aim of this study was to look at the mechanisms leading to this resistance and particularly the role of TolC and efflux mechanisms in determining resistance. METHODS: Ciprofloxacin accumulation was measured spectrofluorometrically. Growth inhibition assays were performed in the presence or absence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (10 mg/L, final concentration). The genome of K. oxytoca was analysed for the existence of loci encoding tolC by PCR using primers for the Enterobacter aerogenes tolC gene and subsequently sequenced. A plasmid named pUC18TolC was constructed and inserted into Escherichia coli C600tolC,Tn5, and the function of TolC was analysed. The structure modelling was performed using the Modeller program. RESULTS: The existence of the AcrAB efflux mechanism was demonstrated in the species, and a TolC-like protein, a channel-forming protein at the external membrane that allows the extrusion of antibiotics by the AcrAB efflux pump, was cloned, sequenced and a model proposed. CONCLUSIONS: K. oxytoca express a functional TolC that lacks a fragment of six amino acids characteristic of the external loops of TolC in E. coli. This makes this species resistant to a few colicins.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - Horizontol dissemination of TEM- and SHV-typr beta-lactamase genes-carrying resistance plasmids amongst clonical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria have been isolated at increasing frequency worldwide. Expression of ESBL is often associated with multidrug resistance and dissemination by resistance plasmids. During a two-month period in 2000, 133 clinical isolates of enterobacterial strains were randomly collected from outpatients and inpatients at a university hospital in Turkey. The ESBL producing strains were determined by double-disk synergy (DDS) testing. Twenty ESBL producing strains (15%) including Escherichia coli (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) and Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2) were detected and further analyzed for their resistance transfer features, plasmid profile and nature of the resistance genes. Plasmid transfer assays were performed using broth mating techniques. TEM- and SHV- genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization using specific probes. EcoRI restriction enzyme analyses of R plasmids were used in the detection of epidemic plasmids. Fourteen plasmid profiles (A, B1, B2, C1, and C2 to L) were obtained with EcoRI restriction enzyme analysis. Most of these plasmids were detected to carry both TEM- and SHV-derived genes by PCR, and confirmed by localizing each gene by hybridization assay. Epidemiological evidence indicated that there was an apparent horizontal dissemination of conjugative R plasmids among multidrug-resistant enterobacterial genera and species in this hospital.
TI  - Clinical experience of serious infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing  VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a Greek University Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dissemination of acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae is regarded as an emerging clinical threat. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 17 cases of infection due to MBL-producing isolates were analyzed. METHODS: During a 3-year period, medical records for all patients with confirmed infection due to an MBL-producing strain belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were retrospectively analyzed. We screened for MBL production with the imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disk synergy test, and results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Genetic relatedness between isolates was evaluated by repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of bacteremia and 3 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to an MBL-producing isolate were studied. Most of the patients had previously been colonized with an MBL-producing organism, and almost 60% had been exposed to carbapenems before infection. The isolated pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 cases; and Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, 1 case each) exhibited variable minimum inhibitor concentrations of carbapenems (1 to >32 microg/mL) and resistance to most other beta-lactams. Tigecycline was active against all isolates, whereas colistin and gentamicin were active against 88% of them. Molecular studies confirmed the presence of a gene belonging to bla(VIM-1) cluster in all isolates. Among the 12 K. pneumoniae isolates, which were subjected to molecular typing, 11 distinct clones were identified. Five cases ( approximately 30%) occurred in patients who were already receiving carbapenem-containing treatment, and carbapenem treatment was considered to have failed. Twelve cases were treated with a colistin-containing regimen. The attributable mortality rate was 18.8%. CONCLUSIONS: MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae can cause severe, often fatal infection in severely ill patients, irrespective of the MIC of carbapenems. Colonization with an MBL-producer is a preceding event, highlighting the importance of surveillance. Both infection control practices and antibiotic policies should be intensified to contain the spread of these problematic bacteria.
TI  - Application of PCR ribotyping and tDNA-PCR for Klebsiella pneumoniae identification.
AB  - PCR analysis of 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (PCR ribotyping) and tRNA intergenic spacer (tDNA-PCR) were evaluated for their effectiveness in identification of clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and differentiation with related species. For this purpose both methods were applied to forty-three clinical isolates biochemically identified as K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae isolated from patients clinical specimens attended at five hospitals in three Brazilian cities. References strains of K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola and Enterobacter aerogenes were also analyzed. Both PCR methods showed specific patterns for each species. A conserved PCR ribotype pattern was observed for all clinical K. pneumoniae isolates, while differing from other related analyzed species. tDNA-PCR revealed five distinct patterns among the K. pneumoniae clinical isolates studied, demonstrating a predominant group with 90.6% of isolates presenting the same pattern of K. pneumoniae type strain. Both PCR-based methods were not able to differentiate K. pneumoniae subspecies. On the basis of the results obtained, both methods were efficient to differentiate the Klebsiella species analyzed, as well as E. aerogenes. Meanwhile tDNA-PCR revealed different tRNA arrangements in K. pneumoniae, suggesting intra-species heterogeneity of their genome organization, the polymorphism of the intergenic spacers between 16S and 23S rRNA genes appears to be highly conserved whithin K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, showing that PCR ribotyping can be an useful tool for identification of K. pneumoniae isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - Regional variations in multidrug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the USA and comparative activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - We report here on the activity of tigecycline and comparators against multidrug-resistant (resistant to >or=3 antimicrobial classes; MDR) Enterobacteriaceae from the USA collected between January 2004 and January 2006 as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST). Nationally, 131 (5.9%) Escherichia coli, 174 (10.1%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 (1.2%) Klebsiella oxytoca, 24 (4.9%) Enterobacter aerogenes, 126 (9.5%) Enterobacter cloacae and 20 (2.6%) Serratia marcescens isolates were MDR. Four isolates (two K. pneumoniae and two E. cloacae) were resistant to nine antimicrobials. Tigecycline performed well against MDR E. coli (MIC(90) 0.5 microg/mL, 0% resistant) and K. pneumoniae (MIC(90) 4 microg/mL, 9.2% resistant). A MIC(90) of 8 microg/mL was reported for tigecycline against the other MDR organisms studied here, notably lower than those of most comparators.
TI  - Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae by use of semiautomated microbiology systems and manual detection procedures.
AB  - Three commercially available microbiology identification and susceptibility testing systems were compared with regard to their ability to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), the VITEK 2 System (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the MicroScan WalkAway-96 System (Dade Behring, Inc., West Sacramento, CA), using routine testing panels. One hundred fifty putative ESBL producers were distributed blindly to three participating laboratories. Conventional phenotypic confirmatory tests such as the disk approximation method, the CLSI double-disk synergy test, and the Etest ESBL were also evaluated. Biochemical and molecular characterization of beta-lactamases performed at an independent laboratory was used as the reference method. One hundred forty-seven isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii were investigated. Of these isolates, 85 were identified as ESBL producers by the reference method. The remaining isolates were identified as non-ESBL producers; they were either hyperproducers of their chromosomal AmpC, Koxy, or SHV enzymes or lacked any detectable beta-lactamase activity. The system with the highest sensitivity for the detection of ESBLs was the Phoenix (99%), followed by the VITEK 2 (86%) and the MicroScan (84%); however, specificity was more variable, ranging from 52% (Phoenix) to 78% (VITEK 2). The performance of the semiautomated systems differed widely with the species investigated. The sensitivities of the conventional test methods ranged from 93 to 94%. The double-disk synergy test showed the highest specificity and positive predictive value among all test methods, i.e., 97% and 98%, respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of a new selective chromogenic agar medium for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A novel chromogenic agar medium (ESBL-Bx; bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was compared to MacConkey agar supplemented with 2 mg ceftazidime/liter (MCKC) for the selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae directly from clinical samples. Of a total of 644 clinical specimens (including 551 fecal samples), 496 yielded no growth and 148 yielded growth on one or both media. Overall, 44 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains (Escherichia coli [n=17], Enterobacter aerogenes [n=17], Klebsiella spp. [n=5], and Citrobacter freundii [n=5]) were isolated from 37 specimens by a combination of both methods after 18 to 24 h of incubation. The sensitivities were 97.7 and 84.1% for ESBL-Bx and MCKC, respectively, with 43 ESBL-positive strains isolated as colored colonies from 36 specimens on ESBL-Bx versus 37 ESBL-positive organisms isolated from 32 specimens on MCKC. The specificities by specimens were 89 and 91% for ESBL-Bx and MCKC, respectively. On either one of the two media, natural AmpC-hyperproducing Enterobacter spp. (n=25) and Citrobacter spp. (n=14) were the most common false positives as well as non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca (n=18) on ESBL-Bx and Morganella morganii (n=10) on MCKC. We conclude that ESBL-Bx is a sensitive and specific medium for the isolation of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. The main advantages of ESBL-Bx over MCKC reside in its chromogenic character and its sensitivity and selectivity, which enabled the recovery and presumptive identification of most ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae within 24 h and reduced by 27% the need for unnecessary identification and confirmation of ESBL testing when disregarding all colorless colonies growing on this medium.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - [Profiles of the utilization of 20 amino acids as the only source of nitrogen and carbon in bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia].
AB  - The profiles of the utilization of 20 protein amino acids in 118 Klebsiella pneumoniae sub- sp. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. planticola, K. mobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marscescens, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinical material were studied. The utilization of amino acids was determined on minimal saline agar containing amino acid as the only source of nitrogen and carbon; the results were evaluated after 72-hour incubation at 37 degrees C. 17 profiles of amino-acid utilization were thus determined, most of them genus-specific in enterobacteria: Klebsiella (profiles No. 1--6, 9, 10), Enterobacter (No. 11--13), Serratia (No. 14--16), Escherichia (No. 17). The full coincidence of amino-acid utilization profiles in bacteria of K. mobilis (No. 1, 6) and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae with out of such profiles in bacteria of the genera Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia was established, which confirmed that K. mobilis (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) belonged to the genus Klebsiella.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli associated with catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated bloodstream infections and hand carriage by healthcare workers in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in infants in neonatal intensive care units. This study describes the species of Gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections in two neonatal intensive care units, compares characteristics of catheter-related and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections, and compares species and antibiotic resistance patterns of these organisms with those isolated from the hands of nurses working in the same neonatal intensive care units. DESIGN: Interventional study. SETTING: Two high-risk neonatal intensive care units. PATIENTS: Neonates hospitalized for >or =24 hrs. INTERVENTIONS: Prospective surveillance for bloodstream infections was performed in two neonatal intensive care units from March 2001 to January 2003. Hand cultures were obtained quarterly from participating nurses immediately after they performed hand hygiene. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 298 episodes of bloodstream infections among 2,935 admissions (5.75 episodes per 1,000 patient-days); 77 of 298 (26%) episodes were caused by Gram-negative bacilli. Among these, 47 (61.0%) were catheter-related bloodstream infections (2.61 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days). Eleven and 24 Gram-negative bacilli species were isolated from neonates and nurses, respectively. The most common Gram-negative bacilli causing bloodstream infections were Klebsiella pneumoniae (38.7%), Escherichia coli (21.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (11.2%), and Serratia marcescens (11.2%). In contrast, Acinetobacter lwoffi (18.1%), K. pneumoniae (11.7%), E. cloacae (10.6%), K. oxytoca (10.6%), and Pseudomonas spp. (7.4%) were most commonly isolated from hands of nurses. E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and E. aerogenes were significantly more likely to cause bloodstream infections than to be isolated from nurses' hands (all p < .001). Although 39% of bloodstream infections were non-catheter-related, there were no significant differences in types of organisms or antimicrobial resistance patterns between catheter-related bloodstream infections and non-catheter-related bloodstream infections (all p > or = .35). Resistance patterns were similar between Gram-negative bacilli isolates from neonates and nurses' hands except for a significantly higher proportion of resistance to cefotaxime and gentamicin among neonatal isolates of K. pneumoniae (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli species isolated from neonatal bloodstream infections and nurses' hands varied significantly. Clean hands of providers are an unlikely source of endemic Gram-negative bacilli, suggesting that prevention strategies should focus more on control of endogenous neonatal flora or environmental sources.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Evaluation of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel for detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the performance of the MicroScan ESBL plus confirmation panel using a series of 87 oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of various species. METHODS: Organisms tested included 57 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains comprising Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Enterobacter cloacae (10), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26), Klebsiella oxytoca (3) and Proteus mirabilis (4). Also included were 30 strains resistant to oxyimino cephalosporins but lacking ESBLs, which were characterized with other resistance mechanisms, such as inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp. (4), hyperproduction of AmpC enzyme in Citrobacter freundii (2), E. aerogenes (3), E. cloacae (3), E. coli (4), Hafnia alvei (1) and Morganella morganii (1), production of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in K. pneumoniae (3) and E. coli (3) or hyperproduction of K1 enzyme in K. oxytoca (6). RESULTS: The MicroScan MIC-based clavulanate synergy correctly classified 50 of 57 ESBL strains as ESBL-positive and 23 of 30 non-ESBL strains as ESBL-negative (yielding a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 76.7%, respectively). False negatives among ESBL producers were highest with Enterobacter spp. due to masking interactions between ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamases. False-positive classifications occurred in two Acinetobacter spp., one E. coli producing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase and two K. oxytoca hyperproducing their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: The MicroScan clavulanate synergy test proved to be a valuable tool for ESBL confirmation. However, this test has limitations in detecting ESBLs in Enterobacter spp. and in discriminating ESBL-related resistance from the K1 enzyme and from inherent clavulanate susceptibility in Acinetobacter spp.
TI  - Recommended test panel for differentiation of Klebsiella species on the basis of  a trilateral interlaboratory evaluation of 18 biochemical tests.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca are the two most frequently encountered Klebsiella species giving rise to infections in humans, but other Klebsiella species can also be found in clinical specimens: Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, Klebsiella terrigena, Klebsiella planticola, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, and Enterobacter aerogenes (Klebsiella mobilis). However, many of these species are indistinguishable by the conventional methods employed routinely in the clinical microbiological laboratory. Several investigators have suggested various additional tests, but as yet there is no standardized test panel for identifying all Klebsiella species and subspecies. In the present study, performed in three national Klebsiella reference laboratories, we have evaluated a test panel consisting of 18 biochemical tests on 242 strains comprising all Klebsiella species and subspecies. The test panel was designed to identify organisms preliminarily identified as belonging to the genus Klebsiella on the basis of conventional methods or automated identification systems. With the described test panel it is possible to find one or more positive test results differentiating any Klebsiella species, except Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, from its closest relative.
TI  - Evaluation of a new cefepime-clavulanate ESBL Etest to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new ESBL Etest configuration based on clavulanate synergy with cefepime compared with cefotaxime-clavulanate and ceftazidime-clavulanate ESBL Etest strips for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) in an Enterobacteriaceae strain collection, with special focus on Enterobacter spp. METHODS: Overall, a total of 54 clinical isolates of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae species were evaluated: Enterobacter aerogenes (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=10), Escherichia coli (n=10), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and Proteus mirabilis (n=3). To check Etest behaviour with resistance phenotypes similar to ESBL, our panel was expanded by six clinical isolates of K. oxytoca that were identified as putative producers of their chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase. RESULTS: With this panel, ESBL Etest was 98% sensitive with cefepime-clavulanate, 83% with cefotaxime-clavulanate, and 74% with ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. Concentrating on Enterobacter spp., reliable ESBL detection could only be achieved by the new cefepime-clavulanate strip since it confirmed ESBL production in all strains (100% sensitivity) whereas only 4/13 (31%) of Enterobacter strains were positive using cefotaxime-clavulanate or ceftazidime-clavulanate strips. A limitation of using the new cefepime strip was less than optimal specificity with K1 phenotypes of K. oxytoca: among six strains, four isolates were scored false-positive by Etest strips containing cefepime-clavulanate. CONCLUSION: The new Etest ESBL strip containing cefepime-clavulanate is a valuable supplement to current methods for detection of ESBLs. In our study collection, the cefepime-clavulanate strip was the best configuration for detection of ESBLs, particularly in Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Sanitary and bacteriological aspects of sewage treatment.
AB  - A study into the removal of contamination load and indicator bacteria was carried out in 1992-1996 in the mechanical, biological and chemical waste-water treatment plant WTP in Lezany, in the County of Reszel, in the Province of Warmia and Mazury in Poland. The results of chemical analyses found a high efficiency of removal of carbon compounds, COD (90%) and BOD (98%), in the process of purification of household sewage. In addition, a high effectiveness of total nitrogen, on average 71%, and unsatisfactory removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were found. The results of microbiological analyses confirmed the high efficiency of removal of indicator bacteria in the process of sewage treatment from 94 to 97%. In the sewage after the final phase of purification in stabilization ponds, the following pathogenic bacteria were identified with the use of the EPL 21tests: Escherichia coli, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter georgoriae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Ervinia herbicola, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia odoriefra, Serratia marcescens, Providencia alcalifaciens, Hafnia alvei, Yersina pestis, Yersina pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia fredericksenii, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, Aeromons hydrophila, Pseudomonas aerulginosa. The obtained results show that although the sewage purification system is efficient and reduces the contamination load to the level required by the regulations (Ministry of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry from 20 September 1991) and removes a great percentage of indicator bacteria, the purified sewage may be a source of pathogenic bacteria in inland waters.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Characterisation, biotyping, antibiogram and klebocin typing of Klebsiella with special reference to Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - 400 strains of Klebsiellae identified by culture characteristics and biochemical  reactions were subjected to biotyping, antibiogram and klebocin typing. Based on indole production, pectin and gelatin liquefaction 16.0% of all the isolates were Klebsiella oxytoca. Maximum sensitivity was shown to Amikacin (72%) and maximum resistance to Ampicillin (87.5%). Klebocin typability was 73.5%. So by combining biotyping, antibiogram and Klebocin typing, Klebsiella could be differentiated better than based on any single marker.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients in four European countries, Canada, and the United States in 2000-2001 to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and comparator antimicrobials: implications for therapy.
AB  - Access to current antimicrobial agent surveillance data is an important prerequisite for the optimal management of patients with hospital-acquired infections. The present study used data collected in 2000 to 2001 from 670 laboratories in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), Canada, and the United States to report on the in vitro activities of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and comparative agents against >125,000 isolates of gram-negative bacteria from hospitalized patients. All but two isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (one isolate of Proteus mirabilis from France and one isolate of Morganella morganii from Canada) were susceptible to imipenem. The susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was > or = 97% in each country, and for P. mirabilis, susceptibility was 99% in each country except Italy. In contrast, susceptibility of E. coli to ciprofloxacin varied from 80.5% (Spain) to 94.0% (France); levofloxacin susceptibility ranged from 75.2% (Spain) to 91.6% (United States). Among Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities ranged from 86.6 to 98.7% and 83.5 to 99.7%, respectively, depending upon the country. Considerable geographic variation in the susceptibilities (generally 85 to 95% susceptible) of Serratia marcescens and M. morganii to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were observed. For S. marcescens, susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam varied from 81.5% (France) to 94.1% (Italy) and susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 66.2% (Germany) to 90.7% (Spain). Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter aerogenes were less susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime than were the other species of Enterobacteriaceae studied. The present study demonstrated that established parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agents retain significant in vitro activity against many clinically important gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from Italy by the BD  Phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  - Production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: Identification of ESBLs based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. The Phoenix ESBL test (BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, Md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of ESBL-producing gram-negative bacteria. An algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter koseri. Of these isolates, 319 were identified as ESBL producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-ESBL producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. Combined use of isoelectric focusing, PCR, and/or DNA sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(TEM-1)- and/or bla(SHV-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(CTX-M) gene. Among the 191 non-ESBL-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an AmpC-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all K. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced K1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. The Phoenix ESBL test system gave positive results for all the 319 ESBL-producing isolates and also for two of the four K1-hyperproducing isolates of K. oxytoca. Compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the Phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. These findings suggest that the Phoenix ESBL test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of ESBL resistance in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Sequencing of 16S rDNA of Klebsiella: taxonomic relations within the genus and to other Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - The 16S rDNAs of 20 strains of Klebsiella were sequenced and used for construction of a phylogenetic tree together with already published Enterobacteriaceae 16S rDNA sequences. The taxonomy within the Klebsiella genus, as reflected by the 16S rDNA tree, was in agreement with existing DNA-DNA hybridisation and numerical taxonomy data, indicating that for Klebsiella, 16S rDNA sequencing is a valid method for identification and taxonomical purposes. Five closely related clusters were found in the Klebsiella genus; Cluster I, K. oxytoca; Cluster II, K. terrigena, Cluster III, K. planticola and K. ornithinolytica; Cluster IV, Enterobacter aerogenes (K. mobilis); and Cluster V, K. pneumoniae. The position of Calymmatobacterium granulomatis within the genus and closest to K. pneumoniae was confirmed. For the species K. oxytoca, data seem to indicate a subdivision into two subspecies. In addition, a biochemically aberrant Klebsiella strain (BEC441) that was included in the analysis could not be assigned to any of the known species, but was found to be closest related to K. oxytoca. Furthermore, the high sequence similarity between the two environmental species K. planticola and K. ornithinolytica does not justify a distinction of the two species. Finally, within a 165-bp stretch of the 16S rDNA sequences, species-specific nucleotides were found.

TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics in injured coliforms isolated from drinking water.
AB  - We studied the antibiotic sensitivity of injured coliforms isolated from drinking water of La Plata, Argentina. The antibiotic sensitivity test by the agar diffusion method were proved in: Klebsiella oxytoca (14 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (4 strains) and Enterobacter cloacae genomic group 3 (14 strains). We found that while these impaired total coliforms were sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam (TAZ), netilmicin (NTL), ofloxacin (OFLX), and norfloxacin (NFLX) (100%), they had resistant to aminopenicillin-sulbactam (AMS) and nitrofurantoin (NIT) (100%). The resistance to antibiotics demonstrated in these strains would point to the need to promote a rational and judicious use of antimicrobial agents while at the same time implementing a program of active vigilance aimed at ensuring the highest quality of drinking water throughout the system.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Phylogenetic analyses of Klebsiella species delineate Klebsiella and Raoultella gen. nov., with description of Raoultella ornithinolytica comb. nov., Raoultella terrigena comb. nov. and Raoultella planticola comb. nov.
AB  - The phylogenetic relationships of the type strains of 9 Klebsiella species and 20 species from 11 genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the sequences of the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes. The sequence data were phylogenetically analysed by the neighbourjoining and parsimony methods. The phylogenetic inference of the sequence comparison confirmed that the genus Klebsiella is heterogeneous and composed of species which form three clusters that also included members of other genera, including Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia clusters I and II and Tatumella. Cluster I contained the type strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae. Cluster II contained Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella planticola, Klebsiella trevisanii and Klebsiella terrigena, organisms characterized by growth at 10 degrees C and utilization of L-sorbose as carbon source. Cluster III contained Klebsiella oxytoca. The data from the sequence analyses along with previously reported biochemical and DNA-DNA hybridization data support the division of the genus Klebsiella into two genera and one genogroup. The name Raoultella is proposed as a genus name for species of cluster II and emended definitions of Klebsiella species are proposed.
TI  - [Isolation and characterization of injured coliforms from the drinking water distribution network of La Plata, Argentina].
AB  - We screened the La Plata drinking water distribution network for fecal and total  coliform bacterial indicator by purification procedures, cultivating 66 membrane-filtered samples from the two networks on m-T7 agar. Subterranean and river-derived water yielded 13 and 18 confirmed gram-negative bacillus isolates, with 54% and 72% representing total coliforms, respectively. Those from the former source were Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Enterobacter aerogenes and from the latter Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Enterobacter cloacae, genomic group 3. Since 58% of the samples were positive using m-T7 medium it is suggested that the inclusion in standard quality control protocols should be implemented.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter aerogenes clinical isolates with alterations in GyrA and ParC proteins.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin were tested against 72 ciprofloxacin-resistant and 28 ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Irrespective of the alterations in GyrA and ParC proteins, clinafloxacin exhibited greater activity than all other fluoroquinolones tested against K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes.
TI  - Use of microdilution panels with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors as a phenotypic test for beta-lactamase production among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - Over the past decade, a number of new beta-lactamases have appeared in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae that, unlike their predecessors, do not confer beta-lactam resistance that is readily detected in routine antibiotic susceptibility tests. Because optimal methodologies are needed to detect these important new beta-lactamases, a study was designed to evaluate the ability of a panel of various beta-lactam antibiotics tested alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors to discriminate between the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, high levels of K1 beta-lactamase, and other beta-lactamases in 141 isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens possessing well-characterized beta-lactamases. The microdilution panels studied contained aztreonam, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, with and without 1, 2, and 4 microg of clavulanate per ml or 8 microg of sulbactam per ml and cefoxitin and cefotetan with and without 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. The results indicated that a minimum panel of five tests would provide maximum separation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase high AmpC, high K1, and other beta-lactamase production in Enterobacteriaceae. These included cefpodoxime, cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftriaxone plus 8 microg of sulbactam per ml. Ceftriaxone plus 2 microg of clavulanate per ml could be substituted for cefpodoxime plus 4 microg of clavulanate per ml without altering the accuracy of the tests. This study indicated that tests with key beta-lactam drugs, alone and in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, could provide a convenient approach to the detection of a variety of beta-lactamases in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in Gizan region, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, Bayadh and Hamra. The bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees C. Two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. The micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. Both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). The content of lactic acid was increased with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). The pH dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third fermentations, respectively. The microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lact. lactis subsp. lactis, Lact. cellobiosus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Kl. pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent. sakazakii, Serratia marcescens and Ser. odourifera), moulds (Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Aspergillus niger, Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp. and Mucor sp.) and yeasts (Candida parapsilosis, C. orvegnsis and Rhodotorula glutinis).
TI  - gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in eight species of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Fluoroquinolone resistance (FQ-R) in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae species has been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. Two mechanisms of FQ-R have been identified in gram-negative organisms: mutations in DNA gyrase and reduced intracellular drug accumulation. A single point mutation in gyrA has been shown to reduce susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. To determine the extent of gyrA mutations associated with FQ-R in enteric bacteria, one set of oligonucleotide primers was selected from conserved sequences in the flanking regions of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This set of primers was used to amplify and sequence the QRDRs from 8 Enterobacteriaceae type strains and 60 fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens. Although similarity of the nucleotide sequences of seven species ranged from 80.8 to 93.3%, when compared with that of E. coli, the amino acid sequences of the gyrA QRDR were highly conserved. Conservative amino acid substitutions were detected in the QRDRs of the susceptible type strains of C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. oxytoca (Ser-83 to Thr), and P. stuartii (Asp-87 to Glu). Strains with ciprofloxacin MICs of >2 microg/ml expressed amino acid substitutions primarily at the Gly-81, Ser-83, or Asp-87 position. Fluoroquinolone MICs varied significantly for strains exhibiting identical gyrA mutations, indicating that alterations outside gyrA contribute to resistance. The type and position of amino acid alterations also differed among these six genera. High-level FQ-R frequently was associated with single gyrA mutations in all species of Enterobacteriaceae in this study except E. coli.
TI  - Occurrence of a novel L-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase activity in some species of Enterobacteriaceae, and purification and characterization of the enzymes of Enterobacter aerogenes and Serratia marcescens.
AB  - L-2,4-Diaminobutyrate decarboxylase (DABA DC) is a novel enzyme yielding 1,3-diaminopropane (DAP) from DABA, which has previously been purified from strains of the genera Vibrio and Acinetobacter. In this study, we also detected DABA DC activity in the species of Enterobacteriaceae: E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, Klebsiella pneumoniace, K. oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii, all of which produced DAP in sufficient amounts. Subsequently, the DABA DCs of E. aerogenes and S. marcescens were purified to homogeneity and characterized. Two separate enzymes had similar properties with respect to chromatographic behaviors, and were a dimer with subunits of identical molecular mass of about 51 kDa. The maximal activity of each enzyme was obtained at pH 8.0-8.25. Both enzymes required pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and Mg2+ for full activity, and were highly specific for L-DABA. There was immunological similarity, but not identity between these proteins, as determined by Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis with antiserum against the E. aerogenes DABA DC. They showed the same N-terminal amino acid sequence up to the 8th residue (S-K-L-N-P-I-L-A-). These enzymes were different in molecular mass, N-terminal amino acid sequence and antigenicity from DABA DCs of Acientobacter and Vibrio species.
TI  - Adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  - Intestinal colonization by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia (KES) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. We studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 KES clinical isolates: 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 Klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 Enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 Serratia sp. (13%) isolates. Half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. A total of 27 of 30 K. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line Intestine-407 (Int-407), while none of the K. oxytoca or E. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the E. cloacae isolates adhered. Three adhesive patterns were observed for K. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. While most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant K. pneumoniae isolates producing the CAZ-5 beta-lactamase. Furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. The distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative E. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/Dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific DNA probes. No relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. Our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Taxonomic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation in the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the Enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. Only eight taxa, Citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, C. youngae, C. braakii, C. werkmanii, Citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, Enterobacter gergoviae and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed both glycerol dehydrogenase type I (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. Six other species, C. koseri, E. aerogenes, E. intermedium, K. oxytoca, K. planticola and K. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type I but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. Other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type II (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type III (induced by glycerol only) and type IV (induced by hydroxyacetone only). They were widely distributed among the Enterobacteriaceae. Classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.
TI  - Demonstration of the indolepyruvate decarboxylase gene homologue in different auxin-producing species of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Different Enterobacteriaceae were assayed for their ability to produce the plant  hormone indole-3-acetate with the aim to study the distribution of the indole-3-pyruvate pathway, which is known to be involved in the production of indole-3-acetate in a root-associated Enterobacter cloacae strain. Other E. cloacae strains, and also Enterobacter agglomerans strains, Pantoea agglomerans, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella oxytoca were found to convert tryptophan into indole-3-acetate. As it was also intended to identify the conserved regions of the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase, which is involved in producing indole-3-acetate in the E. cloacae strain, oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for different regions of the corresponding gene. One pair of these primers allowed us to amplify a segment of the predicted size by the polymerase chain reaction with DNA of the seven different Enterobacteriaceae that produce indole-3-acetate. Segments of five strains were cloned and sequenced. All sequences showed significant homology to the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase gene. As in addition a positive DNA-DNA hybridization signal was detected in the seven strains using the E. cloacae or E. agglomerans segments as a probe, indole-3-acetate biosynthesis is suggested to be catalyzed via the indole-3-pyruvate pathway not only in E. cloacae but also in the other soil-living Enterobacteriaceae. Conserved regions were detected in the indole-3-decarboxylase by alignment of the now-available five different partial sequences. These regions should enable identification of the gene in other bacterial families or even in plants.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Chiral inversion of drug: role of intestinal bacteria in the stereoselective sulphoxide reduction of flosequinan.
AB  - Chiral inversion at a sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers [(+/-)-7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-methylsulphinyl-4-quinolone] occurred in conventional rats but not in either germ-free rats or rats treated with antibiotics after an oral administration of each enantiomer. Thus, it was postulated that the chiral inversion occurred by mechanisms mediated by intestinal bacteria. The intestinal content isolated from conventional rats reduced R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan to produce the sulphide, while intestinal content from rats treated with antibiotics did not reduce the drug. Several strains of facultative anaerobes possessed a high flosequinan reducing activity. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced R(+)-flosequinan to the sulphide stereoselectively. On the other hand, Enterobacter aerogenes and Micrococcus agilis exclusively reduced S(-)-flosequinan. The sulphide, which could be produced by intestinal bacteria from R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan, was readily absorbed upon an oral administration to rats, and was oxidized fairly rapidly to R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan and further to the sulphone form. Based on these data, it has been confirmed that chiral inversion at the sulphoxide position of flosequinan enantiomers occur via stereoselective reduction of sulphoxide by intestinal bacteria to form the sulphide, followed by oxidation of the sulphide in the body to produce R(+)- and S(-)-flosequinan.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Klebsiella pneumoniae as a spoilage organism in mozzarella cheese.
AB  - A high concentration of total and fecal coliforms (5 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(7) cfu/g, respectively) was observed in samples representative of two production lots of Mozzarella cheese from a local dairy. Contamination was manifested by the swelling of plastic pouches and the formation of gas holes in Mozzarella cheese. Aerobic and anaerobic sporeformers, heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, propionibacteria, and yeasts were absent. Of the 41 isolates identified, there were 37 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, and 1 Escherichia coli. Exposure at 63 degrees C for 15 min caused the death of all total and fecal coliforms.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative pBR322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  - Mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pBR322 and pBR325 was shown to occur between Escherichia coli K12 strains in LB-broth at 37 degrees C, provided a mobilizer plasmid (F') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. Evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of F'. It was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pBR325 from E. coli K12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both LB-broth and filtered seawater and that Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of kikA, a region on IncN group plasmids that determines killing of Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - Transfer of the IncN group plasmid pCU1 from Escherichia coli to Klebsiella oxytoca by conjugation kills a large proportion (90 to 95%) of the recipients of plasmid DNA, whereas transfer to E. coli or even to the closely related Enterobacter aerogenes does not. Two regions, kikA and kikB, have been identified on pCU1 that contribute to the Kik (killing in klebsiellas) phenotype. We have localized the kikA region to 500 bp by deletion analysis and show by DNA-DNA hybridization that kikA is highly conserved among the plasmids of incompatibility group N. The expression in K. oxytoca of kikA under the control of the strong inducible E. coli tac promoter results in loss of cell viability. The nucleotide sequence showed two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) within the kikA region. The first ORF codes for a putative polypeptide of 104 amino acids (ORF104). The second ORF codes for a 70-amino-acid polypeptide (ORF70). The properties of the putative protein encoded by ORF104 and gene fusions of kikA to alkaline phosphatase by using TnphoA suggest that killing may involve an association with the bacterial membrane; however, we could not rule out the possibility that ORF70 plays a role in the Kik phenotype.
TI  - Fimbrial types among respiratory isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Bacterial attachment is believed to be an early step in gram-negative nosocomial  pneumonia. The frequency of fimbria-associated adhesins among respiratory pathogens has not been studied in detail. In this study isolates belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, prospectively obtained from intensive care unit patients who were suspected of having nosocomial pneumonia, were examined for fimbria-associated adhesins. Type 3, P, type 1, and other fimbrial phenotypes were identified by specific hemagglutination and electron microscopy. The Klebsiella type 3 fimbrial phenotype was further characterized by using a monoclonal antibody. Also, both type 3 and Escherichia coli P fimbrial genotypes were detected by using DNA colony blot assays. The frequencies of genera or species isolated were as follows: Enterobacter (38.6%), Klebsiella (26.8%), Serratia (17.7%), E. coli (13%), and Proteus (5.2%). Isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae most commonly possessed the type 3 fimbrial phenotype and genotype. The phenotype and genotype for E. coli P fimbriae (46.2 and 50%, respectively), a known pathogenic determinant in the urinary tract, were detected more frequently than expected. In addition, a previously unspecified hemagglutinin that was specific for porcine erythrocytes was almost uniformly expressed among isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes. Finally, the expression of the type 1 fimbrial phenotype was widely detected among the isolates tested but notably absent among K. oxytoca and Proteus mirabilis isolates. The frequency of the various fimbrial types identified suggests a role for these bacterial organelles in adherence to respiratory epithelia.
TI  - Concomitant dissemination of three extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among different Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a French hospital.
AB  - From January 1988 to August 1989, 267 non-repetitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBla) derived from TEM (CTX-1/TEM-3, CAZ-6) or SHV (CAZ-5) were isolated from 219 colonized or infected patients. ESBlas were characterized by analytical isoelectric focusing. Biotypes, resistance phenotypes and plasmid patterns were determined in order to differentiate the isolates in each species. Among the 116 CTX-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 48 strains were differentiated: 27 from 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, seven from 22 Enterobacter aerogenes isolates, and 14 from a combined total of seven K. oxytoca, five Serratia marcescens, six Escherichia coli, 1 Enterobacter cloacae and 1 Citrobacter freundii. CAZ-5 has been isolated since January 1988 in 16 different strains among 101 K. pneumoniae isolates. CAZ-6 was first identified in K. pneumoniae (January 1988). Among the 48 Enterobacteriaceae producing CAZ-6, 12 strains were differentiated: four from 39 E. aerogenes isolates, three from four K. pneumoniae, and five from a combined total of two S. marcescens, two E. coli and one E. cloacae. During this outbreak, CTX-1 was found to be encoded by 85 kb (Inc 7/M) or greater than or equal to 150 kb (Inc 6/C) plasmids. CAZ-6 was always encoded by an 85 kb (Inc 7/M) plasmid and CAZ-5 by a greater than 150 kb plasmid. These results show that strain epidemics and plasmid dissemination occurred mainly in K. pneumoniae and E. aerogenes for CTX-1, in E. aerogenes for CAZ-6, and in K. pneumoniae for CAZ-5. They also suggest that the bla(tem) gene (CTX-1) has spread between different plasmids present in the same ecosystem.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of sulbactam, alone and in combination with ampicillin, cefotaxime, mezlocillin, and piperacillin.
AB  - The in vitro effects of the single agents, and the synergistic/antagonistic action of three different combinations of ampicillin (AMP, CAS 69-53-4), cefotaxime (CTX, CAS 63527-52-6), mezlocillin (MEZ, CAS 51481-65-3), and piperacillin (PIP, CAS 61477-96-1) with the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (SUL, CAS 68373-14-8) were determined against 675 gram-positive and gram-negative, both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. All the combinations of sulbactam and the antibiotics (1: 1, 1:2 and 1:4) exhibited very similar synergistic action. The percentage of the total strains tested for which synergistic activity was found was 51% with SUL + AMP (1:1), 24% with SUL + CTX (1:1), 31% with SUL + MEZ (1:1), and 28% with SUL + PIP (1:1). A fourfold or greater reduction of MIC's in the comparison with the antibiotics alone was found with 23% of the total strains tested for the SUL + AMP, with 9% of the strains tested with SUL + CTX, with 11% of the strains tested with SUL + MEZ, and with 15% of the strains tested with the SUL + PIP-combination. In the presence of sulbactam, 18% of the strains tested showed a significant reduction in the number of resistant strains with ampicillin, 7% with cefotaxime, 16% with mezlocillin, 14% with piperacillin, and in parallel there was an increase in the number of fully susceptible strains (shift from resistant or moderately sensitive to sensitive) by about 14%. In comparison with the antibiotic alone, the most marked reductions in the number of resistant strains on combination with sulbactam were as follows (the percentage of reduction is shown in brackets): for SUL + AMP and Acine-tobacter spp. (39% fewer resistant strains). Citrobacter spp. (-60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (-48%), Klebsiella oxytoca (-49%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (-63%), Morganella morganii (-74%), and Proteus vulgaris (-55%); for SUL + CTX and Acinetobacter spp. (-38%), Enterobacter cloacae (-6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (-16%), Serratia marcescens (-9%), and Bacteroides fragilis (-31%); for SUL + MEZ and Acinetobacter spp. (-68%), Citrobacter spp. (-27%), Enterobacter spp. (-23%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (-32%), and Serratia marcescens (-19%); for SUL + PIP and Acinetobacter spp. (-41%), Citrobacter spp. (-30%), Klebsiella spp. (-30%), and Serratia marcescens (-33%).
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of TEM-3 (CTX-1) beta-lactamase.
AB  - A total of 33 clinical isolates encoding TEM-3 (CTX-1) from four French hospitals were studied. The strains belonged to seven species, Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 24), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens (n = 2), Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 1), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1), and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1). All the strains harbored an Inc7 or M self-transferable plasmid with a size of approximately 85 kilobases. The plasmids had closely related EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, and PvuII restriction endonuclease-generated patterns and conferred resistance to all beta-lactams, except cephamycins and imipenem; to tetracycline, because of the presence of the genes blatem-3 and tetC, respectively, as determined by hybridization with specific probes; and to sulfonamide. Depending on the presence or absence and level of expression of the genes aacA4, aadA, and dfrI and of insertion element IS15, four types of plasmids could be distinguished. Plasmid pCFF04, the prototype plasmid encoding TEM-3, was widespread and appeared, by Southern hybridization, as the progenitor of the other types of replicons. The plasmid epidemic responsible for dissemination of TEM-3 in clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae may have originated in S. marcescens since pCFF04 was first detected in this species.
TI  - Prevention of clinical coliform mastitis in dairy cows by a mutant Escherichia coli vaccine.
AB  - A prospective cohort study was undertaken in two commercial California dairies. The treatment group, 246 cows, received three doses of a whole cell bacterin of J5 Escherichia coli (mutant of E. coli O111:B4) plus Freund's incomplete adjuvant vaccine (two in the dry period and one after calving) while 240 unvaccinated cows served as controls. Thirty-five cases of clinical coliform mastitis were diagnosed, six in vaccinated cows and 29 in unvaccinated cows. Bacteria isolated from the clinical cases included 15 E. coli five Klebsiella pneumoniae, three K. oxytoca, three K. ozaenae, five Enterobacter aerogenes, three Serratia marcescens and one Serratia spp. Four control cows were culled, three of them because of chronic coliform mastitis and one because of postcoliform infection agalactia. Incidence rate of clinical gram-negative mastitis was 2.57% in vaccinated cows and 12.77% in unvaccinated cows. The estimated risk ratio, the measure of risk of having clinical gram-negative mastitis for vaccinated cows to unvaccinated cows, was 0.20 (p less than 0.005), indicating a strong relationship between vaccination and lack of clinical gram-negative mastitis. The results of this trial indicate that the administration of the E. coli J5 vaccine is protective against natural challenge to gram-negative bacteria, and reduces the incidence of clinical gram-negative mastitis in dairy cows during the first three months of lactation.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [A specific property of bacteria in the genus Klebsiella--a color reaction with 5-aminosalicylic acid in the nutrient medium].
AB  - For the first time bacteria of the genus Klebsiella have been found to possess a  specific property, characteristic of this genus only, i.e. the capacity of giving color reaction with 5-aminosalicylic acid. This reaction can be observed in all Klebsiella species under study: K. pneumoniae (94.4 +/- 2.3%), K. ozaenae (93.3 +/- 4.5%), K. rhinoscleromatis (100%), K. oxytoca (88.0 +/- 4.9%), K. mobilis (92-5 +/- 4.3% of the strains). In all other bacteria under study (40 species, 22 genera and 7 families) the reaction is negative. The test for the color reaction with 5-aminosalicylic acid confirms the belonging of K. mobilis (Enterobacter aerogenes) to the genus Klebsiella, thus making it possible to simplify and accelerate the identification of Klebsiella.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Activity of 9 beta-lactam antibiotics combined with clavulanic acid or sulbactam against the strains of broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (CTX-1) producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the Henri Mondor Hospital].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of seven cephalosporins: cefotaxime (CTX), ceftriaxone (CRO), ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (MOX), cefoxitin (FOX), cefotetan (CTT) and CM 40876 (CM), of aztreonam (ATM) and imipenem (IPM) were evaluated by agar dilution with and without 5 mg/l of clavulanic acid (AC) or sulbactam (SB) for 28 strains isolated in 1986 (15 K. pneumoniae, 3. K. oxytoca, 4 E. coli, 4 E. cloacae, 1 E. aerogenes and 1 C. freundii). Comparatively to MICs of sensitive strains and to those of cured variants, MICs of these strains were very increased for CTX, CRO, ATM (mode MIC: 1 mg/l), and CAZ (2); weakly increased for MOX and CTT (0.25), and identical for IMP (0.12-0.25), CM (0.06) and FOX (2-4), except for Enterobacter and Citrobacter (64). Association with AC or SB did not modify MICs of FOX, CM and IMP. For the other antibiotics, MICs were reduced by addition of AC: Klebsiella: 5 log2 for CTX and CRO, 4 for CAZ and ATM, 2 for MOX and CTT; E. coli: 4 log2 for CTX and ATM, 3 for CRO and CAZ, 1 for MOX and CTT; Enterobacter and Citrobacter 2 log2 for CTX, CRO, CAZ and ATM, 1 for MOX and CTT. With SB, decrease of MICs was two to for fold lesser than with AC. AC, and less efficiently SB, restored activity of CTX, CRO, CAZ and ATM on CTX-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Klebsiella and E. coli. It was the same for MOX and CTT, weakly affected by this resistance. AC and SB had not effect on FOX, CM and IPM which remained active on these strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - Comparative study of serum bactericidal activity of cefotaxime alone or in combination with tobramycin.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the bactericidal activity in serum of cefotaxime alone or in combination with tobramycin against clinical strains and to determine the influence of tobramycin on the pharmacokinetics of cefotaxime. The peak bactericidal activity in serum of cefotaxime alone against Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Listeria monocytogenes varied between 1:4 and 1:256. Bactericidal activity could still be detected at 6 h against K. oxytoca and L. monocytogenes. The addition of tobramycin increased the bactericidal activity of cefotaxime against E. aerogenes from 1:16 to 1:128 (P less than 0.01). Cefotaxime recovery from urine was significantly decreased when tobramycin was added. Our data are comparable with those of other investigators who have shown a limited increase in the bactericidal activity of cefotaxime when aminoglycosides are added.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. It had MIC90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, oxytoca, Citrobacter, Providencia, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Morganella and Proteus mirabilis. It inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. Against Pseudomonas the pefloxacin MIC90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus had a MIC50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a MIC90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and S. faecalis had a MIC90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin inhibited Salmonella spp., Salmonella typhi, Shigella spp., Yersinia, Aeromonas, toxigenic E. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. There was a minimal difference in MIC and MBC values in broth or serum, but major changes in MIC and MBC values occurred in acid urine. Increase in MIC values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Heterogeneity of the fatty acid composition of bacteria in the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Hafnia and Serratia].
AB  - The analysis of the chromatograms of methyl esters of fatty acids in bacterial strains of the tribe Klebsielleae showed the heterogeneity of the fatty acid composition of bacteria belonging to the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Hafnia and Serratia. The bacteria of this tribe could be subdivided into 5 provisory groups in accordance with the composition and profile of their fatty acids. Group I comprised K. pneumoniae K1, K. ozaenae and K. rhinoscleromatis strains forming a separate group characterized by the absence of cyclopropane fatty acids; group II comprised K. pneumoniae strains of other capsular serovars (K2, K8, K11, K13, K41, K47), as well as K. aerogenes and K. oxytoca strains. The fatty acid composition of the strains of group III, comprising E. aerogenes and E. cloacae, was similar to that of E. coli O1; only among the fatty acids of these bacteria acid C20:0 could be detected. H. alvei strains were included into group IV; their fatty acid profiles were similar to those of the genus Enterobacter, but had a higher content of acids C15:0 and C18:0. S. marcescens strains were similar to the strains of group II in their fatty acid composition, but considerably differed from the latter by a higher content of hexadecanoate (C16:0) and a lower level of C18:1; for this reason they were regarded as provisory group V.
TI  - Klebsiella and Enterobacter strains derived from hospital infections. I. Correlation between species, phage type and antibiotic sensitivity.
AB  - Four hundred and seventy Klebsiella and 103 Enterobacter strains derived from urogenital infections, upper respiratory tract and wound infections were examined. (i) K. aerogenes was the most common among Klebsiella species, K. ozaenae and K. atlantae occurred frequently, K. pneumoniae, K. rhinoscleromatis, K. edwardsii and K. oxytoca were found rarely. The strains isolated from urine showed the most heterogeneous species distribution. Enterobacter species were in the order of frequency E. cloacae, E. liquefaciens, E. aerogenes. (ii) K. aerogenes strains belonged to 10, K. atlantae strains to 6 phage types; phage type II.A1 was the most frequent phage types. Typability varied between 23.7% and 48.0% with the different Klebsiella species, except K. edwardsii and K. oxytoca strains. None of the strains of these species were typable by phages. Among the Enterobacter species examined, only one E. liquefaciens strain was typable by phages. Strains of genus Enterobacter were lysed by the diagnostic phage C14 in 64%, no lysis was observed in the strains of genus Klebsiella. (iii) Multiple resistance was demonstrated in 36.6% of Klebsiella strains and in 16.5% of Enterobacter strains. The majority of the multiresistant strains was isolated from urine in both genera. Multiresistant strains belonged to the species K. aerogenes, E. cloacae and E. liquefaciens. Strains resistant to ampicillin were divided into 6 groups on the basis of cephaloridine and cephalothin resistance. The rate of multiresistant strains was higher among the Klebsiella and Enterobacter strains not typable by phages than in the typable ones.
TI  - Evaluation of the four-hour Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, Gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  - A 4-h Micro-ID technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by API 20E and Micro-ID, using standardized inocula. A total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. Isolates included 96 Escherichia coli, 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Klebsiella oxytoca, 8 Enterobacter aerogenes, 17 Enterobacter cloacae, 19 Serratia marcescens, 2 Serratia liquefaciens, 8 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Salmonella species, 1 Morganella morganii, 6 Haemophilus influenzae, 2 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 Bacteroides fragilis, 3 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia. In 90% of the cultures, identification by Micro-ID was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. Enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct Micro-ID were three S. marcescens (two identified as S. liquefaciens, one as Hafnia alvei), two S. liquefaciens (both identified as E. cloacae), and two K. pneumoniae (one identified as Klebsiella ozaenae, the other as Serratia rubidaea). None of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by Micro-ID (non-identifiable, or classified as Providencia/Yersinia/Klebsiella species). Although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final Micro-ID tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. Direct species identification of Enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct Micro-ID is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct Micro-ID technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
TI  - Fermentation of polysaccharides by Klebsielleae and other facultative bacilli.
AB  - Fermentations of 10 polysaccharides by species of the family Enterobacteriaceae were examined. Algin, guar, karaya, xanthan, and xylan were not fermented by any of the strains tested. Most of the activity was found in the tribe Klebsielleae. Klebsiella oxytoca fermented amylopectin (97% of the strains studied), carrageenan (100%), inulin (68%), polypectate (100%), and tragacanth (100%). Klebsiella pneumoniae fermented amylopectin (91%), carrageenan (100%), and tragacanth (86%). Carrageenan was also fermented by Enterobacter aerogenes (100%), Enterobacter agglomerans (63%), Enterobacter cloacae (95%), and Pectobacterium (38%). Pectobacterium shared polypectate fermentation (100%) with K. oxytoca. With one exception, Serratia strains were negative on all polysaccharides. These results, along with other evidence, indicate that (i) the genus Klebsiella is biochemically the most versatile genus of the tribe, (ii) because of its distinct characteristics, K. oxytoca warrants species designation separate from K. pneumoniae, and (iii) some food additives generally considered indigestible can be metabolized by a few species of facultative bacilli, whereas others appear to be resistant.
TI  - Distinctive electrophoretic patterns of esterases from Klebsiella pneumoniae, K.  oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes and E. gergoviae.
AB  - Esterases of 14 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 strains of K. oxytoca, 16 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and 16 strains of E. gergoviae were analysed by horizontal electrophoresis in polyacrylamide-agarose gel. Four principal esterase bands (designated E1 to E4) and nine minor bands differing in their activity towards synthetic substrates and in their sensitivity to heat and to di-isofluoropropyl phosphate were defined. The comparative distribution of bands showed that the four species analysed were characterized by distinct electrophoretic patterns of their esterases. Band E1 was found in all four species, bands E2 and E3 only in K. oxytoca and band E4 only in some strains of E. gergoviae. The apparent molecular weights of esterases E2 and E3, determined by electrophoresis in a 4 to 30% polyacrylamide gradient gel, were 58000 (+/- 1000) and 72000 (+/- 1800), respectively.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - [Distinctive profiles of esterases from Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes and E. gergovia].
AB  - Cellular esterases of 14 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 strains of K. oxytoca, 16 strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and 16 strains of E. gergoviae were analysed by polyacrylamide-agarose gel and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Four principal esterase bands and nine minor bands, differing in their activity towards synthetic substrates and in their sensitivity to heat and to di-isofluoropropyl phosphate (DEP) were defined. The comparative distribution of bands showed that the four species analysed were characterized by distinct electrophoretic patterns of their esterases.
