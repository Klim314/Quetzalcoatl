TI  == [anaerobic bacteria involved in the degradation of aromatic sulfonates to methane].
AB  == an anaerobic microbial consortium that degrades benzene- and p-toluenesulfonate to form methane and fatty acids has been produced. pure cultures of three strains of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria clostridium spp., as well as the sulfate-reducing bacteria desulfovibrio sp., were isolated and characterized. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences of strains showed that pure cultures of clostridia strains 14, 24, and 21 are close to clostridium lituseburense dsm 797t, c. sartagoforme dsm 1292t, and c. pascui dsm 10365t, and  the sulfate-reducing strain sr1 is genotypically closer to desulfovibrio aminophilus ala-3t. preliminary characterization of isolated bacteria makes it possible to assume that these are new species of the genera clostridium and desulfovibrio, the distinctive feature of which is the ability to incorporate aromatic sulfonates in their metabolisms.

TI  == [analysis of microbial community variation in the domestication process of sludge in a sulfate-reducing reactor].
AB  == the variations of microbial community in the sludge of sulfate-reducing uasb during domestication period were analyzed by pcr-dgge technique. the results showed that the diversity of microbial community was strongly related to the sulfate reduction and cod removal performance. the sulfate reduction rate of the  reactor was about 95% when the shannon index of microbial community was higher than 3.45. the preponderant bands in dgge figure were excised and cloned, and the sequencing analysis indicated there were firmicutes, proteobacteria, deinococcus-thermus and chloroflexi in the sludge, which accounted for 50.0%, 28.6% 14.3% and 7.1% of the total sequences of samples, respectively. the anaerobic fermentative bacteria of clostridium sp. were predominant in the whole  domestication period, but the predominant species was changing. some anaerobic bacteria like chloroflexi sp. and geopsychrobacter sp. were detected to be dominant species, which then disappeared along with further domestication, but anaerobic bacteria geobacter sp. became gradually predominant in the domestication process. species of desulfovibrio sp. were detected to be predominant only in the last two phases of domestication.

TI  == genome sequence determination and metagenomic characterization of a dehalococcoides mixed culture grown on cis-1,2-dichloroethene.
AB  == a dehalococcoides-containing bacterial consortium that performed dechlorination of 0.20 mm cis-1,2-dichloroethene to ethene in 14 days was obtained from the sediment mud of the lotus field. to obtain detailed information of the consortium, the metagenome was analyzed using the short-read next-generation sequencer solid 3. matching the obtained sequence tags with the reference genome  sequences indicated that the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium was highly homologous to dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb1 and bav1. sequence comparison with the reference sequence constructed from 16s rrna gene sequences in a public database showed the presence of sedimentibacter, sulfurospirillum, clostridium, desulfovibrio, parabacteroides, alistipes, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus and proteocatella in addition to dehalococcoides sp. after further enrichment, the members of the consortium were narrowed down to almost three species. finally, the full-length circular genome sequence of the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium, d. mccartyi ibaraki, was determined by analyzing the metagenome with  the single-molecule dna sequencer pacbio rs. the accuracy of the sequence was confirmed by matching it to the tag sequences obtained by solid 3. the genome is  1,451,062 nt and the number of cds is 1566, which includes 3 rrna genes and 47 trna genes. there exist twenty-eight rdase genes that are accompanied by the genes for anchor proteins. the genome exhibits significant sequence identity with other dehalococcoides spp. throughout the genome, but there exists significant difference in the distribution rdase genes. the combination of a short-read next-generation dna sequencer and a long-read single-molecule dna sequencer gives detailed information of a bacterial consortium.

TI  == [biodiversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria growing on objects of heating systems].
AB  == it was shown that sulfate-reducing bacteria developed on the sections of kyiv municipal heating systems, which are exploited in conditions of different temperatures. the bacteria were different as to their morphological and physiological properties. the bacteria of desulfovibrio genus were revealed on the sections, which were exploited at a temperature of 35-40 degrees c and bacteria of desulfomicrobium and desulfotomaculum genera were revealed on the sections with a higher temperature such as 60 degrees c. based on of the 16s rrna gene analysis data, it was demonstrated that sequences of tc2, tc3 and tc4 clones related to desulfovibrio sp. dsm 12803 (100% sequence similarity), desulfotomaculum sp. ecp-c-5 (92% sequence similarity) and desulfomicrobium baculatum strain dsm 2555 (99% sequence similarity), respectively. the identified bacteria are potentially dangerous for heating systems and can be the agents of microbial corrosion.

TI  == tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  == the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (cahs), perchloroethene (pce), carbon tetrachloride (ct),  chloroform (cf) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-dca), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  clostridium sp. and paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens, shewanella oneidensis and desulfovibrio vulgaris). effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (ec50) were determined. the octanol-water partition coefficient or log po/w of a cah proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar cahs cf and 1,2-dca, respectively, than the two relatively  less polar compounds pce and ct. ec50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher  tolerance levels. overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to cahs than  respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to cahs. these data extend the current understanding of the impact of cahs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.

TI  == the effect of heavy metals on microbial community structure of a sulfidogenic consortium in anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors.
AB  == the effect of heavy metals on community structure of a heavy metal tolerant sulfidogenic consortium was evaluated by using a combination of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrb) gene fragments, 16s rrna gene cloning analysis and fluorescence  in situ hybridization (fish). for this purpose, four anaerobic semi-continuous stirred tank reactors (referred as r1-r4) were run in parallel for 12 weeks at heavy metal loading rates of 1.5, 3, 4.5 and 7.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) each of cu(2+), ni(2+), zn(2+), and cr(6+), respectively. the abundance ratio of desulfovibrio vulgaris detected by fish to total cell counts was consistent with the obtained results of cloning and dgge. this indicated that d. vulgaris was dominant in all  analyzed samples and played a key role in heavy metal removal in r1, r2, and r3.  in contrast, after 4 weeks of operation of r4, a distinct biomass loss was observed and no positive hybridized cells were detected by specific probes for the domain bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria and d. vulgris. high removal efficiencies of heavy metals were achieved in r1, r2 and r3 after 12 weeks, whereas the precipitation of heavy metals in r4 was significantly decreased after 4 weeks and almost not observed after 6 weeks of operation. in addition, the anaerobic bacteria, such as pertrimonas sulfuriphila, clostridium sp., citrobacter amalonaticus, and klebsiella sp., identified from dgge bands and clone library were hypothesized as heavy metal resistant bacteria at a loading rate of 1.5 mg l(-1) d(-1) of cu(2+), ni(2+), zn(2+), and cr(6+.)

TI  == implications of volatile fatty acid profile on the metabolic pathway during continuous sulfate reduction.
AB  == volatile fatty acid (vfa) profile is an important parameter in anaerobic reactors because it enables the assessment of metabolic pathways. volatile fatty acids were monitored during sulfate reduction in a uasb (upflow anaerobic sludge blanket) reactor treating 2g/l sulfate concentration and with the organic loading increasing from 3.5 kg cod/m(3)d to 5.9 kg cod/m(3)d, for a 1-day residence time. in the absence of recirculation, the best outcome (65% reduction) was noticed with the lowest organic loading (3.55 kg/m(3)d). when recirculation was applied,  sulfate reduction yields increased to 89%, corresponding to a sulfate removal rate of 1.94 kg so(4)(2-)/m(3)d. the reactor performance was discussed in relation to microbial diversity and metabolic pathways. at high organic loading,  two metabolic pathways account for lactate degradation: (i) lactate is oxidized to acetate and carbon dioxide by the incomplete-oxidizer srb (sulfate-reducing bacteria) desulfomonas, desulfovibrio, desulfolobus, desulfobulbus and desulfotomaculum spp.; (ii) lactate is converted to acetate by fermenting bacteria such as clostridium sp. high propionate concentrations imply that there  are low sulfate reduction efficiencies.

TI  == composition and dynamics of sulfate-reducing bacteria during the waterflooding process in the oil field application.
AB  == the composition and dynamics of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) during the waterflooding process of daqing oilfield were investigated in this study. pcr-dgge analysis indicated that the microbial communities were significantly different in each treatment unit, and the dominant members were mainly close to clostridium sp., thauera sp., hydrogenophaga sp., pseudomonas sp., eubacterium sp. and arcobacter sp. however, the members belonging to srb were relatively few  and mainly consisted of desulfovibrio sp. and desulfovibrio profundus. according  to aps (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate reductase) gene clone library and sequence analysis, it was found that srb mainly belonged to proteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria. in the library, the genus desulfovibrio of deltaproteobacteria was about 65.2% while genus desulfomonas, desulfomicrobium, desulfohalobium, desulfonatronum, desulfbulbus, desulforhopalus, desulfnema and desulforhopalus were occupied nearly 34.8%. it was also proved that most of srb in the oil field were enriched in the ground treatment unit and they are not in the liquid of oil well.

TI  == the effect of decreasing alkalinity on microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor as analyzed by pcr-sscp.
AB  == pcr-single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and southern blotting techniques were adopted to investigate microbial community dynamics in a sulfate-reducing bioreactor caused by decreasing influent alkalinity. experimental results indicated that the sulfate-removal rate approached 87% in 25 d under the conditions of influent alkalinity of 4000 mg/l (as caco3) and sulfate-loading rate of 4.8 g/(l*d), which indicated that the bioreactor started  up successfully. the analysis of microbial community structure in this stage showed that lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. were dominant populations. it was found that when influent alkalinity reduced to 1000 mg/l, sulfate-removal rate decreased rapidly to 35% in 3 d. then influent alkalinity was increased to 3000 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to 55%. under these conditions, the populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacte sp., obesumbacterium  sp. and clostridium sp. got to rich, which predominated in the community together with lactococcus sp., anaerofilum sp. and kluyvera sp. however, when the alkalinity was decreased to 1500 mg/l, the sulfate-removal rate rose to and kept  stable at 70% and populations of dysgonomonas sp., sporobacter sp. and obesumbacterium sp. died out, while some strains of desulfovibrio sp. and clostridium sp. increased in concentration. in order to determine the minimum alkalinity value that the system could tolerate, the influent alkalinity was decreased from 1500 to 400 mg/l secondly. this resulted in the sulfate-removal rate, ph value and effluent alkalinity dropping quickly. the amount of petrotoga  sp., prevotella sp., kluyvera sp. and neisseria sp. reduced obviously. the result data from southern blotting indicated that the amount of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srbs) decreased with influent alkalinity dropping. analysis of the microbial community structure and diversity showed that the srbs populations were very abundant in the inoculated activated sludge and the alkalinity decrease caused the reduction of the populations noted. most of resident populations in the bioreactor were fermentative acidogenic bacteria (fabs), among which the phylum firmicute was in the majority, but srbs were very few. this community structure demonstrates the cooperation between srbs and fabs, which sustains the  system's high sulfate-removal and operation stability.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of tce-dechlorinating consortia enriched on a variety of electron donors.
AB  == two rapidly fermented electron donors, lactate and methanol, and two slowly fermented electron donors, propionate and butyrate, were selected for enrichment  studies to evaluate the characteristics of anaerobic microbial consortia that reductively dechlorinate tce to ethene. each electron donor enrichment subculture demonstrated the ability to dechlorinate tce to ethene through several serial transfers. microbial community analyses based upon 16s rdna, including terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone library/sequencing, were performed to assess major changes in microbial community structure associated with electron donors capable of stimulating reductive dechlorination.  results demonstrated that five phylogenic subgroups or genera of bacteria were present in all consortia, including dehalococcoides sp., low g+c gram-positives (mostly clostridium and eubacterium sp.), bacteroides sp., citrobacter sp., and delta proteobacteria (mostly desulfovibrio sp.). phylogenetic association indicates that only minor shifts in the microbial community structure occurred between the four alternate electron donor enrichments and the parent consortium.  inconsistent detection of dehalococcoides spp. in clone libraries and t-rflp of enrichment subcultures was resolved using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  (q-pcr). q-pcr with primers specific to dehalococcoides 16s rdna resulted in positive detection of this species in all enrichments. our results suggest that tce-dechlorinating consortia can be stably maintained on a variety of electron donors and that quantities of dehalococcoides cells detected with dehalococcoides specific 16s rdna primer/probe sets do not necessarily correlate well with solvent degradation rates.

TI  == [analysis of the anaerobic microbial community capable of degrading p-toluene sulphonate].
AB  == three strains of clostridium sp., 14 (vkm b-2201), 42 (vkm b-2202), and 21 (vkm b-2279), two methanogens, methanobacterium formicicum mh (vkm b-2198) and methanosarcina mazei mm (vkm b-2199), and one sulfate-reducing bacterium, desulfovibrio sp. sr1 (vkm b-2200), were isolated in pure cultures from an anaerobic microbial community capable of degrading p-toluene sulfonate. strain 14 was able to degrade p-toluene sulfonate in the presence of yeast extract and bactotryptone and, like strain 42, to utilize p-toluene sulfonate as the sole sulfur source with the production of toluene. p-toluene sulfonate stimulated the  growth of ms. mazei mm on acetate. the sulfate-reducing strain desulfovibrio sp.  sr1 utilized p-toluene sulfonate as an electron acceptor. the putative scheme of  p-toluene sulfonate degradation by the anaerobic microbial community is discussed.

TI  == biological degradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene.
AB  == nitroaromatic compounds are xenobiotics that have found multiple applications in  the synthesis of foams, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and explosives. these compounds are toxic and recalcitrant and are degraded relatively slowly in the environment by microorganisms. 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) is the most widely used nitroaromatic compound. certain strains of pseudomonas and fungi can use tnt as a nitrogen source through the removal of nitrogen as nitrite from tnt under aerobic conditions and the further reduction of the released nitrite to ammonium, which is incorporated into carbon skeletons. phanerochaete chrysosporium and other fungi mineralize tnt under ligninolytic conditions by converting it into reduced tnt intermediates, which are excreted to the external milieu, where they  are substrates for ligninolytic enzymes. most if not all aerobic microorganisms reduce tnt to the corresponding amino derivatives via the formation of nitroso and hydroxylamine intermediates. condensation of the latter compounds yields highly recalcitrant azoxytetranitrotoluenes. anaerobic microorganisms can also degrade tnt through different pathways. one pathway, found in desulfovibrio and clostridium, involves reduction of tnt to triaminotoluene; subsequent steps are still not known. some clostridium species may reduce tnt to hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes, which are then further metabolized. another pathway has been described in pseudomonas sp. strain jlr11 and involves nitrite release and further reduction to ammonium, with almost 85% of the n-tnt incorporated as organic n in the cells. it was recently reported that in this strain tnt can serve as a final electron acceptor in respiratory chains and that the reduction of tnt is coupled to atp synthesis. in this review we also discuss a number of biotechnological applications of bacteria and fungi, including slurry reactors, composting, and land farming, to remove tnt from polluted soils. these treatments have been designed to achieve mineralization or reduction of tnt and immobilization of its amino derivatives on humic material. these approaches are highly efficient in removing tnt, and increasing amounts of research into the potential usefulness of phytoremediation, rhizophytoremediation, and transgenic plants with bacterial genes for tnt removal are being done.

TI  == modeling reduction of uranium u(vi) under variable sulfate concentrations by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == the kinetics for the reduction of sulfate alone and for concurrent uranium [u(vi)] and sulfate reduction, by mixed and pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria (srb) at 21 +/- 3 degrees c were studied. the mixed culture contained the srb desulfovibrio vulgaris along with a clostridium sp. determined via 16s ribosomal dna analysis. the pure culture was desulfovibrio desulfuricans (atcc 7757). a zero-order model best fit the data for the reduction of sulfate from 0.1 to 10 mm. a lag time occurred below cell concentrations of 0.1 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. for the mixed culture, average values for the maximum specific reaction rate, v(max), ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of srb. h(-1)) at 0.25 mm sulfate to 5.0 +/- 1.1 micromol of sulfate/mg (dry weight) of srb. h(-1) at 10 mm sulfate (average cell concentration, 0.52 mg [dry weight]/ml). for the pure culture, v(max) was 1.6 +/- 0.2 micromol of sulfate/mg  (dry weight) of srb. h(-1) at 1 mm sulfate (0.29 mg [dry weight] of cells/ml). when both electron acceptors were present, sulfate reduction remained zero order  for both cultures, while uranium reduction was first order, with rate constants of 0.071 +/- 0.003 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) for the mixed culture and 0.137 +/- 0.016 mg (dry weight) of cells/ml. min(-1) (u(0) = 1 mm) for the d. desulfuricans culture. both cultures exhibited a faster rate of uranium reduction in the presence of sulfate and no lag time until the onset of u reduction in contrast to u alone. this kinetics information can be used to design an srb-dominated biotreatment scheme for the removal of u(vi) from an aqueous source.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

TI  == tungsten in biological systems.
AB  == tungsten (atomic number 74) and the chemically analogous and very similar metal molybdenum (atomic number 42) are minor yet equally abundant elements on this planet. the essential role of molybdenum in biology has been known for decades and molybdoenzymes are ubiquitous. yet, it is only recently that a biological role for tungsten has been established in prokaryotes, although not as yet in eukaryotes. the best characterized organisms with regard to their metabolism of tungsten are certain species of hyperthermophilic archaea (pyrococcus furiosus and thermococcus litoralis), methanogens (methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and mb. wolfei), gram-positive bacteria (clostridium thermoaceticum, c. formicoaceticum and eubacterium acidaminophilum), gram-negative anaerobes (desulfovibrio gigas and pelobacter acetylenicus) and gram-negative aerobes (methylobacterium sp. rxm). of these, only the hyperthermophilic archaea appear to be obligately tungsten-dependent. four different types of tungstoenzyme have been purified: formate dehydrogenase, formyl methanufuran dehydrogenase, acetylene hydratase, and a class of phylogenetically related oxidoreductases that catalyze the reversible oxidation of aldehydes. these are carboxylic reductase, and three ferredoxin-dependent oxidoreductases which oxidize various aldehydes, formaldehyde and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. all tungstoenzymes catalyze redox tungsten in these enzymes is bound by a pterin moiety similar to that found in molybdoenzymes. the first crystal structure of a tungsten- or pterin-containing enzyme, that of aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase from p. furiosus, has revealed a catalytic site with one w atom coordinated to two pterin molecules which are themselves bridged by a magnesium ion. the geochemical, ecological, biochemical and phylogenetic basis for w- vs. mo-dependent organisms is discussed.

TI  == acetogenesis from dichloromethane by a two-component mixed culture comprising a novel bacterium.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic two-component culture able to grow exponentially with a doubling time of 20 h on a medium containing dichloromethane as the carbon and energy source was characterized. on a medium without sulfate, we observed (per mol of dichloromethane) a mass balance of 2 mol of chloride, 0.26 mol of acetate, 0.05 mol of formate, and 0.25 mol of carbon in biomass. one component of the culture, strain dmb, was identified by a 16s ribosomal dna analysis as a desulfovibrio sp. the other component, the gram-positive organism strain dmc, could not be isolated. it was possible, however, to associate strain dmc on a medium containing dichloromethane in a coculture with acetobacterium woodii or methanospirillum hungatei. coculture of strain dmc with the archaeon m. hungatei  allowed us to specifically amplify by pcr the 16s rrna gene of strain dmc. a phylogenetic analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna sequence revealed that this organism groups within the radiation of the clostridium-bacillus subphylum and exhibits the highest levels of sequence similarity (89%) with desulfotomaculum orientis and desulfitobacterium dehalogenans. since the novel organism strain dmc was able to grow acetogenically with dichloromethane when it was associated with  one of three metabolically different partners and since, in contrast to strain dmb, strain dmc contained carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity, this bacterium  is responsible for both the dehalogenation of dichloromethane and the acetogenesis observed in the original two-component culture. the obligatory dependence of strain dmc on a partner during growth with dichloromethane is thought to stem from the need for a growth factor produced by the associated organism.

TI  == assignment of fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria to syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov. on the basis of 16s rrna sequence analyses.
AB  == after enrichment from chinese rural anaerobic digestor sludge, anaerobic, sporing and nonsporing, saturated fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria were isolated as cocultures with h2- and formate-utilizing methanospirillum hungatei or desulfovibrio sp. strain g-11. the syntrophs degraded c4 to c8 saturated fatty acids, including isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate. they were adapted to grow on crotonate and were isolated as pure cultures. the crotonate-grown pure cultures alone did not grow on butyrate in either the presence or the absence of some common electron acceptors. however, when they were reconstituted with m. hungatei, growth on butyrate again occurred. in contrast, crotonate-grown clostridium kluyveri and clostridium sticklandii, as well as clostridium sporogenes, failed to grow on butyrate when these organisms were cocultured with  m. hungatei. the crotonate-grown pure subcultures of the syntrophs described above were subjected to 16s rrna sequence analysis. several previously documented fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophs grown in pure cultures with crotonate were also subjected to comparative sequence analyses. the sequence analyses revealed that the new sporing and nonsporing isolates and other syntrophs that we sequenced, which had either gram-negative or gram-positive cell wall ultrastructure, all belonged to the phylogenetically gram-positive phylum. they were not closely related to any of the previously known subdivisions in the gram-positive phylum with which they were compared, but were closely related to each other, forming a new subdivision in the phylum. we recommend that this group be designated syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov.; a description is given.

TI  == enumeration and relative importance of acetylene-reducing (nitrogen-fixing) bacteria in a delaware salt marsh.
AB  == three groups of n(2)-fixing bacteria were enumerated from the top 1 cm of the surface in four vegetational areas in a delaware salt marsh. the results over the 9-month sampling period showed that there were no discernible seasonal patterns for any of the groups enumerated (azotobacter sp., clostridium sp., and desulfovibrio sp.). azotobacter sp. was present in numbers of 10 per g of dry mud, whereas the two anaerobic fixers were present in much lower numbers (10 to 10 per g of dry mud). there were no differences in the numbers of each group among the different vegetational areas, indicating that there was a heterogeneous population of n(2) fixers present. additional studies indicate that the activity  of sulfate reducers (desulfovibrio sp.) may account for as much as 50% of the total observed acetylene reduction activity. oxygen was found to exert little effect on the observed acetylene reduction activity, indicating that stable aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments exist in the surface layer of marsh sediments.
