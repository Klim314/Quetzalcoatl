TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == properties of the ames salmonella mutants lodged in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == an association of the histidine auxotroph of salmonella typhimurium (strain ta1538) within the gastrointestinal tract of otherwise germ-free sprague-dawley rats is maintained during observations for up to 7 months. the bacteria exceed concentrations of 10(7)/g in the forestomach and exceed concentrations of 10(8)/g in the lower bowel and feces. when carcinogens are ingested, the number of revertants in the feces increases. the ingestion of structurally related compounds which are not mutagenic to the bacteria in vitro and for which no evidence of carcinogenicity exists does not increase the number of revertants in  the feces. the numbers of salmonella are increased by the addition of lactobacillus plantarum and bacteroides fragilis but the salmonella disappear from the gastrointestinal tract when the rats are conventionalized. with the additional flora, there is a decrease in the number of revertants appearing in the feces in response to a given dose of carcinogen. this decrease may reflect an effect of the flora on the activity of the metabolic pathway responsible for the  presence of the ultimate carcinogen or it may simply be an effect on the salmonella mutants themselves.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
