TI  == aetiology of caprine footrot in extremadura region, spain.
AB  == the present study reports on the location of major foci of footrot in goats in the extremadura region of spain by the determination of locally occurring strictly anaerobic microorganisms involved in the pathogenesis and development of this disease. the most commonly isolated microorganisms belonged to the genera dichelobacter, fusobacterium, porphyromonas and prevotella; these were found in conjunction with other species of minor importance. the species most frequently isolated were fusobacterium necrophorum (40%), dichelobacter nodosus (31.7%), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (21.1%) and prevotella melaninogenica (12.9%). virulence factors identified in the isolated microorganisms included haemolysins, elastases and lecithinases, which enabled the organisms involved to initiate and/or aggravate the disease. serotyping was performed for dichelobacter nodosus  isolates, since this species is responsible for triggering the process of infection. a and c were the most frequently isolated serovarieties (representing  40.7% and 25.9% of the cases, respectively).

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas species.
AB  == background: this study determined the beta-lactamase production and the antimicrobial resistance of 72 prevotella species and 48 porphyromonas species isolated from different clinical specimens. methods: all strains were identified  using api 32 id. the beta-lactamase production was determined by nitrocefin disks. e test strips of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole and imipenem were tested for each strain. results: nineteen prevotella melaninogenica, 18 prevotella intermedia, 16 prevotella denticola, 11 prevotella loescheii and 8 prevotella bivia strains were identified. four were clindamycin resistant. the highest beta-lactamase production was found at a rate of 68.4% in p. melaninogenica species. additionally, 33 porphyromonas asaccharolytica and 15 porphyromonas gingivalis strains were identified. none of them produced beta-lactamase. conclusion: in view of the emerging antibiotic resistance among anaerobes, the current local susceptibility profile of our prevotella and porphyromonas species will establish the basis for additional surveys tracing significant changes in the antimicrobial resistance of our clinical isolates.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the rapid id 32a system (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france) for the identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the  bacteroides fragilis group. methods: five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-b. fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were tested in the rapid id 32a system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. results: the rapid id 32a system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. a further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by  the manufacturer. fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level  only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. three isolates of prevotella were not identified by the system. of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. conclusions: the rapid id 32a system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-b. fragilis group, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. there was poor discrimination between fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum, between porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis, and between prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella oralis. the need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == the in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), bacteroides vulgatus  (5 strains), bacteroides spp. (15 strains), prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), peptococcus niger (3 strains), peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), peptococcus spp (30 strains), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in wilkins-chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in  an atmosphere of 10% h2, 10% co2, 80% n2. all the drugs tested exert their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic isolates. in particular, trospectomycin is quite active against gram-positive cocci (mic 90 =  4 - 8 mg/l), gram-negative rods (mic 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), gram-positive rods (mic 90 = 4 mg/l) and mobiluncus spp. (mic 90 = 0.5 mg/l).

TI  == prevotella and porphyromonas infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1994, 504 isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were obtained from 435 (21%) of 2033 specimens from 418 children. they included 160 (32%) pr. melaninogenica, 105 (21%) pr. intermedia, 84 (17%) p. asaccharolytica,  58 (12%) pr. orisbuccae, and 58 (12%) pr. oralis. most prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). the micro-organisms most commonly isolated with prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), fusobacterium spp. (108), bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (95), escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). most bacteroides spp. and e. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck  sites. beta-lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) prevotella and porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. all patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. four patients died from their infection. these data illustrate the spectrum and importance of prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in infections in children.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in genito-urinary tract and pelvic infections.
AB  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are part of the normal vaginal flora and  contribute to a range of superficial and deep genital infections. prevotella melaninogenica is found in moderate numbers (10(4-6) cfu/g) in healthy women; the numbers and detection rates increase in anaerobic vaginosis (where it may be a significant contributor to changed microbial metabolic activity that gives the signs and symptoms of this condition) and in other vaginal infective conditions.  pr. melaninogenica is also part of the mixed flora in deep pelvic infections: endometritis, post-partum and post-abortal uterine infections; salpingitis and tubo-ovarian abscesses; pid and pelvic abscesses. porphyromonas asaccharolytica is probably not a vaginal commensal, but may be isolated from patients with vaginal or pelvic disease. it is more specifically associated with superficial abscesses (e.g. bartholin's abscess) and ulcers of the genitalia and perineum. p. asaccharolytica was the commonest species isolated from men with genital ulcers of various primary causes and ranging in severity from superficial balanitis/balanoposthitis to synergic gangrene.

TI  == classification of black-pigmented anaerobes by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms)  and conventional tests (cts).
AB  == clinical (66: dental 53; vaginal 4; wound 9) and reference (5*) strains of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were examined in pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) and conventional tests (cts). the strains were identified in cts as: prevotella intermedia (48*); pr. melaninogenica (1); pr. corporis (7); porphyromonas asaccharolytica (12*); p. endodontalis (1*) and p. gingivalis (2*). numerical classification based on cts resolved five clusters comprising strains identified as (i) pr. corporis, (ii) pr. melaninogenica, (iii) pr. intermedia, (iv) p. gingivalis and (v) p. asaccharolytica and p. endodontalis. numerical classification based on pms showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity in the order pr. intermedia, pr. corporis, p. asaccharolytica, in agreement with the ordering of homogeneity for these species in cts. pms clusters corresponding the porphyromonas spp. were clearly distinct from those of prevotella spp. pms and ct classifications disagreed on cluster membership for only six of the strains. pms identification from blind challenge sets agreed with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.

TI  == occurrence of plasmids in black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are causative agents of pyogenic infections and are closely linked to various forms of periodontal diseases. whereas many studies have shown a high incidence of plasmids in intestinal bacteroides spp., there have been only a few reports of plasmid analyses in pigmented gram-negative anaerobes. according to previous reports and confirmed in this study, plasmids can be present in porphyromonas asaccharolytica, prevotella  intermedia, pr. melaninogenica, and b. levii but have not been detected in p. gingivalis or other black-pigmented species. there were no correlations between plasmids and phenotypes such as resistance to antibiotics or bacteriocinogenicity. the highest carriage rate was found in isolates from cases  of chronic otitis media, but the relationship between this site of infection and  a high incidence of plasmids could be incidental. the size of plasmids ranged from 1.5 to 29 mda. plasmids with molecular weight > 10 mda were described for the first time in these organisms. repeated plasmid analyses showed that the plasmid patterns were generally stable.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == rapid presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by using 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives.
AB  == a rapid method for presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was developed. using filter paper spot tests for indole production, sialidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and trypsinlike enzyme activities, 100% of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides levii and 89% of prevotella corporis isolates were correctly identified to the species level. porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis could not be differentiated from each other but could  be distinguished from all other species tested. similarly, prevotella denticola,  prevotella loescheii, and prevotella melaninogenica could not be differentiated from each other. the methods described are based on 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives of the various substrates and are simple to perform, rapid (less than 15 min), and applicable to difficult-to-cultivate anaerobic rods.
