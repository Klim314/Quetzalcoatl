TI  == efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees c.
AB  == an amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees c. nine american type culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic  strains (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium  sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli ([atcc 25922 and atcc 11775], salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and lactobacillus casei). the bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal  samples. there were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline  and after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of p. anaerobius. for p. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. the tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.

TI  == in vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (td-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacterium spp.
AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

TI  == differences in antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse formulations: an in vitro contact test and salivary bacterial counts study.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinses. material and methods: the in vitro antimicrobial activity test consisted in a modified contact test where 20 selected bacterial species were tested during 1 min with each test product. after the contact, the inoculum was cultured, and the results were expressed in terms of survival/resistance and the percentage of survival as compared to a saline control. the in vivo test consisted of a double-blind, randomized, crossover salivary bacterial counts study. 10 volunteers rinsed during 1 min with each tested product. saliva samples were obtained before rinsing, and after 5 min, and 1, 3, 5 and 7 h. these samples were cultured both aerobically and anaerobically.  percentages of survival, in regard to baseline, were calculated for each time point. comparisons among products were tested using anova and selected paired t-test. results: the in vitro contact test showed no survival in any tested species with chx+cpc, while three species (lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and peptostreptococcus micros) were resistant to the other three products.  chx and chx+naf demonstrated additional resistant species (three and four species, respectively). the in vivo salivary bacterial counts test showed higher  reductions of chx+cpc and chx+alc in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, lasting for  5 h. significant differences were detected at multiple time points, when these two products were compared both with the control and the other tested products. conclusion: important differences in activity, among 0.12% chx products, were detected by both in vitro and in vivo tests. the formulation with alcohol was more active than those without alcohol, excepting the formulation with chx+cpc, in which the reformulation and addition of cpc not only compensate but rather increase the antimicrobial activity.

TI  == an immunohistological study of the localization of bacteria invading root pulpal  walls of teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == we immunohistologically examined the prevalence and localization of bacteria invading dentinal tubules of the roots of teeth with infected canals. forty extracted teeth with apical lesions were selected and divided into two groups: a  group of untreated teeth and a group of canal-enlarged teeth. the bacteria in the specimens were detected by brown-brenn stain and the labeled-streptavidin-biotin  method with specific antisera for 16-bacteria. seventy percent of the examined teeth showed bacteria invading the dentinal tubules of the roots. fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium alactolyticum, e. nodatum, lactobacillus casei, and peptostreptococcus micros were abundant. even in the canal-enlarged group, invasion of bacteria was observed in 65% of teeth. this study revealed the actual condition of bacteria in infected root dentin and suggested that the canal-enlargement procedure could not completely remove all the bacteria in the infected dentinal tubules of the root.

TI  == bacterial colonization and degradation of demineralized dentin matrix in situ.
AB  == lesion formation in dentin involves demineralization followed by degradation of the exposed organic matrix. proteinases from microorganisms present in the dentin are believed to play an important role in the breakdown of the dentinal collagen. in this study, the microflora colonizing decalcified dentin matrix, placed in situ, was identified. the gelatinolytic activity of the isolated strains was assessed and related to the degradation of the dentin matrix. the predominant species found were streptococcus mitis. peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium species and veillonella parvula. marked interindividual variation in the composition of the microflora was observed. the  microflora possessed gelatinolytic activity, although no correlation was found with the severity of dentin matrix degradation. the chemically determined loss of collagen varied between 0 and 67 wt% per participant and corresponded with the extent of collagen degradation observed by transmission electron microscopy.

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.
