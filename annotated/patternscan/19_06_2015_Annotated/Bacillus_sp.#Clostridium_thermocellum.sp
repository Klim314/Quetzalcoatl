TI  == structural modelling, substrate binding and stability studies of endopectate lyase (pl1b) of family 1 polysaccharide lyase from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == an endo-pectate lyase (pl1b) of family 1 polysaccharide lyase from clostridium thermocellum was structurally characterized and its stability under chaotropic agent was determined. the putative domain pl1b was identified from the protein sequence abn53381.1 belonging to superfamily 3 of pectate lyase. multiple sequence alignment of pl1b with other known pectate lyases revealed the conserved and semi-conserved residues. the secondary structure of pl1b predicted by psipred and confirmed by circular dichroism showed the presence of 2 alpha-helices (2.06%), 26 beta-strands (40.54%) and 29 random coils (57.4%). the modelled protein represented right handed parallel beta-helix structure, where three parallel beta-sheets linked by loops coils around to form the beta-helix core. quality assessment of energy minimized structure by ramachandran plot displayed 82.8% residues in favoured region. superposition of pl1b structure with bsp165-pela from bacillus sp. revealed the substrate binding cleft formed by the  amino acid residues from the loops and beta-sheet. molecular dynamic simulation of modelled pl1b structure inferred that it is quite stable and compact. docking  studies identified asp151, arg209, asn234, arg236, tyr271 and ser272 as the key residues of pl1b involved during catalysis. among them arg209 is responsible for  proton abstraction during beta-elimination. protein melting studies on pl1b showed that there was 12 degrees c shift of peak from 74 to 86 degrees c in presence of 0.6 mm ca(2+) ions, showing that they provide stability to the structure. the unfolding of pl1b by guhcl or urea by fluorescence study showed that the protein structure is stable and disintegrates at their higher concentrations.

TI  == production of xynx, a large multimodular protein of thermoanaerobacterium sp., by protease-deficient bacillus subtilis strains [corrected].
AB  == xynx of thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kda. an escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynx produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kda intracellularly. the bacillus subtilis wb700 transformant with the xynx, a strain deficient in seven proteases including vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of  65 and 44 kda. the b. subtilis wb800 transformant with xynx, a strain deficient in eight proteases including vpr and wpra, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 u ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kda, than the wb700 transformant, 6.93 u ml(-1). this indicates that the additional deletion of wpra enabled the wb800 to  secrete xynx in its intact form. b. subtilis wb800 produced more total enzyme activity than e. coli (1,692 +/- 274 u vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 u), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. the results suggest the potential use of b. subtilis wb800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.

TI  == [effects of microbial agent inoculation on bacterial community diversity in the process of pig manure composting].
AB  == pcr-dgge method was adopted to study the effects of inoculating exogenous microbial agent on the bacterial community diversity in the process of fresh pig  manure high-temperature aerobic composting. exogenous microbial agent inoculation promoted the composting process, with the high-temperature period being advanced  by 2 days than that of non-inoculation. dgge pattern analysis showed that during  composting, the dominant bacteria changed significantly, with the shannon-wiener  index of bacterial community at different composting periods varied obviously. the sequencing of dgge-distinguished bands showed that clostridium stercorarium subsp. thermolacticum sp. was the dominant group in the whole composting process. uncultured bacteria bacillus coagulans sp. and clostridium thermocellum sp. became the main groups on the 10th and 16th day after microbial agent inoculation, while uncultured firmicutes sp. and delta proteobacterium became the dominant groups on the 5th and 16th days in the treatment non-inoculation, respectively. un-dominant group ureibacillus thermosphaericu sp. and uncultured silvimonas sp. appeared in the late period of well rotted composting, while uncultured soil bacteria mainly appeared in the initial and high-temperature periods. upgmc cluster analysis showed that exogenous microbial agent inoculation obviously affected the bacterial community structure in different composting periods, and the main component analysis of dgge patterns in composting process showed that the bacterial community was mainly affected by the exogenous microbial agent inoculation.

TI  == high-level secretion of a chimeric thermostable lichenase from bacillus subtilis  by screening of site-mutated signal peptides with structural alterations.
AB  == a chimeric gene mhg (669 bp) was constructed by substitution of clostridium thermocellum zjl4 lichenase (cg) n-terminal fragment (except its signal sequence) for the counterpart of bacillus sp. a3 lichenase (bg). to acquire high-level secretion of the chimeric lichenase (mhg) in bacillus subtilis, a series of site-mutated signal peptides were designed. the activity of mhg, which was directed by an artificial hydrophobic signal peptide h1 (mmarkiagmatsllvifsssava) from cytoplasm into growth medium, reached 80.56 u/ml after 22-h incubation, indicating that signal peptide hydrophobicity appears to be critical for early stages in mhg export. by purification of the mhg (approximately 25.3 kda) from cultures of b. subtilis (pbsg-h1), enzymatic property assays showed that the common optima for mhg were 70 degrees c and ph 5.0. the residual activity of mhg  at 90 degrees c for 10 min was 83.45% of its maximum activity, which was almost similar to that of cg (90 degrees c, 10 min, 84.33%). this constructed shuttle expression vector with a novel signal peptide exhibited its applicability for high-level production of heterologous proteins from b. subtilis. moreover, the high-level secreted mhg with relatively high thermostability could be a potential candidate for feed industrial applications.

TI  == new aerobic ammonium-dependent obligately oxalotrophic bacteria: description of ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  == the genus ammoniphilus is proposed for aerobic endospore-forming gram-variable rod-shaped bacteria, which are ammonium-dependent, obligately oxalotrophic and haloalkalitolerant, oxidase- and catalase-positive, mesophilic and motile by peritrichous flagella. cell wall contained two electron-dense layers. the external layer consists of a chain of electron-dense granules morphologically resembling the cellulosomes of clostridium thermocellum. two species are described, ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strains of these species are strains raox-1 (= dsm 11538) and raox-fs (= dsm 11537), respectively. ammoniphilus strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of sorrel (rumex acetosa) and from decaying wood. the strains require a high concentration of ammonium ions and use  oxalate as the sole organic source of carbon and energy for growth; no growth factors were required. growth occurred at ph 6.8-9.5. the optimum temperature and ph for growth were 28-30 degrees c and 8.0-8.5. all strains grew in a saturated solution of ammonium oxalate, and tolerated 3% nacl. whole-cell hydrolysates contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and glucose. the menaquinone of the strains was  mk 7, and the major cellular fatty acids were 12-methyl tetradecanoic, cis-hexadec-9-enoic and hexadecanoic acids. the g + c content of the dna was 45-46 mol% for a. oxalaticus and 42 mol% for a. oxalivorans. the almost complete  16s rdna sequence of three strains of the two species of ammoniphilus shows that  the genus falls into the radiation of the clostridium-bacillus subphylum of gram-positive bacteria. the closest phylogenetic neighbour of ammoniphilus is oxalophagus oxalicus. the dna-dna hybridization value between strains raox-1 and  raox-fs was 39.7%.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from bacillus sp. ksm-330.
AB  == the gene encoding an acid endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from bacillus sp. ksm-330 was cloned into the hindiii site of pbr322 and expressed in escherichia coli hb101. the recombinant plasmid contained a 3.1 kb hindiii insert, 1.8 kb of which was sufficient for the expression of endoglucanase activity in e. coli hb101. nucleotide sequencing of this region (1816 bp) revealed an open reading frame of  1389 bp. the protein deduced from this sequence was composed of 463 amino acids with an mr of 51882. the deduced amino acid sequence from amino acids 56 through  75 coincided with the amino-terminal sequence of the endoglucanase, endo-k, purified from culture of bacillus sp. ksm-330. the deduced amino acid sequence of endo-k had 30% homology with that of the cela enzyme from clostridium thermocellum ncib 10682 and 25% homology with that of the enzyme from cellulomonas uda cb4. however, the endo-k protein exhibited no homology with respect to either the nucleotide or the amino acid sequences of other endoglucanases from bacillus that had been previously characterized. these results indicate that the gene for endo-k in bacillus sp. ksm-330 has evolved from an ancestral gene distinct from that of other bacillus endoglucanases.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of genes encoding xylan-degrading enzymes from the thermophile "caldocellum saccharolyticum".
AB  == a lambda recombinant bacteriophage coding for xylanase and beta-xylosidase activity has been isolated from a genomic library of the extremely thermophilic anaerobe "caldocellum saccharolyticum." partial sau3ai fragments of the lambda recombinant dna were ligated into pbr322. a recombinant plasmid with an insertion of ca. 7 kilobases of thermophilic dna expressing both enzymatic activities was isolated. the location of the genes has been established by analyzing deletion derivatives, and the dna sequence of 6.067 kilobases of the insert has been determined. five open reading frames (orfs) were found, one of which (orf1; mr 40,455) appears to code for a xylanase (xyna) which also acts on o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside. another, orf5 (mr 56,365), codes for a beta-xylosidase (xynb). the xyna gene product shows significant homology with the xylanases from the alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain c125 and clostridium thermocellum.

TI  == cellulase families revealed by hydrophobic cluster analysis.
AB  == the amino acid sequences of 21 beta-glycanases have been compared by hydrophobic  cluster analysis. six families of cellulases have been identified on the basis of primary structure homology: (a) endoglucanases b, c and e of clostridium thermocellum; endoglucanases of erwinia chrysanthemi and bacillus sp.; endoglucanase iii of trichoderma reesei; endoglucanase i of schizophyllum commune; (b) cellobiohydrolase ii of t. reesei; endoglucanases of cellulomonas fimi and streptomyces sp; (c) cellobiohydrolases i of t. reesei and of phanerochaete chrysosporium; endoglucanase i of t. reesei; (d) endoglucanase a of c. thermocellum and an endoglucanase from ce. uda; (e) endoglucanase d of c. thermocellum and an endoglucanase from pseudomonas fluorescens; (f) xylanases of  c. thermocellum and of cryptococcus albidus and the cellobio-hydrolase of ce. fimi. for each family, conserved potentially catalytic residues have have been listed and previous allocations of the active-site residues are evaluated in the  light of the alignment of the amino acid sequences. a strong homology is also reported for the putative cellulose-binding domains of cellulases of ce. fimi and of p. fluorescens.

TI  == heterologous hybridization of bacterial dna to the endoglucanases a and b structural genes cela and celb of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == dna from various cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria was found to hybridize to clostridium thermocellum ncib10682 dna fragments carrying the structural genes cela and celb which code for endoglucanases a and b. homology to cela was detected in agrobacterium rhizogenes, azospirillum brasilense, bacillus  subtilis, cellulomonas sp., clostridium stercorarium, erwinia chrysanthemi, pseudomonas solanacearum and streptomyces griseus. homology to celb was detected  only in b. subtilis, c. stercorarium and e. chrysanthemi. no homology to cela or  celb was detected in agrobacterium tumefaciens, rhizobium japonicum, rhizobium meliloti, rhizobium ors571 and trichoderma reesei. hybridization performed with the homologous strain ncib10682 and with c. thermocellum lqri suggested that the  two strains were identical in terms of cel genes. in addition, it is likely that  the c. thermocellum cel genes, whose number is presently estimated to be at least ten, do not belong to a gene family, since heterologous hybridization was observed only to a single small ecori or hindiii fragment homologous to celb.
