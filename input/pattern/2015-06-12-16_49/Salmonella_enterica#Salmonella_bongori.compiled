TI  - Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in Seri Kembangan, Malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  - This study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around Seri Kembangan, a city in Malaysia. Pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of OTUs with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. Taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed across all samples. The highest appearance frequencies (100%) were OTUs closely related to Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas sp. and Pseudomonas putida. Several OTUs were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazaki, Cronobacter turisensis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Hafnia alvei, Kurthia gibsonii, Salmonella bongori, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella tyhpi, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. The condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. Regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.
TI  - Differentiation of Salmonella strains from the SARA, SARB and SARC reference collections by using three genes PCR-RFLP and the 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer.
AB  - Rapid molecular typing methods are important tools in surveillance and outbreak investigations of human Salmonella infections. Here we described the development of a three-genes PCR-RFLP typing method for the differentiation of Salmonella species, subspecies and serovars using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The fliC, gnd, and mutS genes were PCR-amplified in 160 Salmonella strains representing the two Salmonella species, six subspecies, and 41 different serovars of S. enterica subspecies enterica. PCR products were individually cut with two different restriction enzymes and the resulting 930 restriction patterns were collected using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer followed by cluster analysis. Both species of Salmonella were differentiated by conventional PCR. All of S. bongori tested were gnd PCR negative due to a mismatch at the 3'-end in one the PCR primers. Salmonella subspecies were differentiated into third-teen homogeneous groups representing each of the six subspecies by cluster analysis of restriction patterns generated from the mutS gene cut with AciI. S. enterica subspecies enterica serovars were further differentiated by the combination of the three target genes and five out the six sets of restriction patterns with a discriminatory power of 0.9725 by cluster analysis. The combined RFLP results of five sets of restriction patterns allowed us to assign each of the 160 strains to one of 128 restriction types. During inoculation studies we were able to identify S. Saintpaul and Typhimurium from 24 h pre-enrichment samples using the described method. The use of fliC, gnd, and mutS PCR-RFLP with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer can provide an accessible and automated alternative method for differentiation of Salmonella pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of the Thermo Scientific SureTect Salmonella species assay. AOAC Performance Tested Method 051303.
AB  - The Thermo Scientific SureTect Salmonella species Assay is a new real-time PCR assay for the detection of Salmonellae in food and environmental samples. This validation study was conducted using the AOAC Research Institute (RI) Performance Tested Methods program to validate the SureTect Salmonella species Assay in comparison to the reference method detailed in International Organization for Standardization 6579:2002 in a variety of food matrixes, namely, raw ground beef, raw chicken breast, raw ground pork, fresh bagged lettuce, pork frankfurters, nonfat dried milk powder, cooked peeled shrimp, pasteurized liquid whole egg, ready-to-eat meal containing beef, and stainless steel surface samples. With the exception of liquid whole egg and fresh bagged lettuce, which were tested in-house, all matrixes were tested by Marshfield Food Safety, Marshfield, WI, on behalf of Thermo Fisher Scientific. In addition, three matrixes (pork frankfurters, lettuce, and stainless steel surface samples) were analyzed independently as part of the AOAC-RI-controlled laboratory study by the University of Guelph, Canada. No significant difference by probability of detection or McNemars Chi-squared statistical analysis was found between the candidate or reference methods for any of the food matrixes or environmental surface samples tested during the validation study. Inclusivity and exclusivity testing was conducted with 117 and 36 isolates, respectively, which demonstrated that the SureTect Salmonella species Assay was able to detect all the major groups of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica (e.g., Typhimurium) and the less common subspecies of S. enterica (e.g., arizoniae) and the rarely encountered S. bongori. None of the exclusivity isolates analyzed were detected by the SureTect Salmonella species Assay. Ruggedness testing was conducted to evaluate the performance of the assay with specific method deviations outside of the recommended parameters open to variation (enrichment time and temperature, and lysis temperature), which demonstrated that the assay gave reliable performance. Accelerated stability testing was additionally conducted, validating the assay shelf life.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. using a generic and differential FRET-PCR.
AB  - To facilitate the detection of Salmonella and to be able to rapidly and conveniently determine the species/subspecies present, we developed and tested a generic and differential FRET-PCR targeting their tetrathionate reductase response regulator gene. The differential pan-Salmonella FRET-PCR we developed successfully detected seven plasmids that contained partial sequences of S. bongori and the six S. enterica subspecies. The detection limit varied from ~5 copies of target gene/per PCR reaction for S. enterica enterica to ~200 for S. bongori. Melting curve analysis demonstrated a T m of ~68 degrees C for S. enterica enterica, ~62.5 degrees C for S. enterica houtenae and S. enterica diarizonae, ~57 degrees C for S. enterica indica, and ~54 degrees C for S. bongori, S. enterica salamae and S. enterica arizonae. The differential pan-Salmonella FRET-PCR also detected and determined the subspecies of 4 reference strains and 47 Salmonella isolated from clinically ill birds or pigs. Finally, we found it could directly detect and differentiate Salmonella in feline (5/50 positive; 10%; one S. enterica salamae and 4 S. enterica enterica) and canine feces (15/114 positive; 13.2%; all S. enterica enterica). The differential pan-Salmonella FRET-PCR failed to react with 96 non-Salmonella bacterial strains. Our experiments show the differential pan-Salmonella FRET-PCR we developed is a rapid, sensitive and specific method to detect and differentiate Salmonella.
TI  - Validation of the ANSR Salmonella method for detection of Salmonella spp. in selected foods and environmental samples.
AB  - ANSR Salmonella is a new molecular diagnostic assay for detection of Salmonella spp. in foods and environmental samples. The test is based on the nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology. The assay platform features simple instrumentation, minimal labor, and, following a single-step 10-24 h enrichment (depending on sample type), an extremely short assay time of 30 min, including sample preparation. Detection is real-time using fluorescent molecular beacon probes. Inclusivity testing was performed using a panel of 113 strains of S. enterica and S. bongori, representing 109 serovars and all genetic subgroups. With the single exception of the rare serovar S. Weslaco, all serovars and genetic subgroups were detected. Exclusivity testing of 38 non-salmonellae, mostly Enterobacteriaceae, yielded no evidence of cross-reactivity. In comparative testing of chicken carcass rinse, raw ground turkey, raw ground beef, hot dogs, and oat cereal, there were no statistically significant differences in the number of positive results obtained with the ANSR and the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Food Safety and Inspection Service or U.S. Food and Drug Administration/Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference culture methods. In testing of swab or sponge samples from five different environmental surfaces, four trials showed no statistically significant differences in the number of positive results by the ANSR and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration/ Bacteriological Analytical Manual reference methods; in the trial with stainless steel surface, there were significantly more positive results by the ANSR method. Ruggedness experiments showed a high degree of assay robustness when deviations in reagent volumes and incubation times were introduced.
TI  - Genome Sequence of Salmonella bongori Strain N268-08 [corrected].
AB  - Salmonella bongori is a close relative of the highly virulent members of S. enterica subspecies enterica, encompassing more than 2,500 serovars, most of which cause human salmonellosis, one of the leading food-borne illnesses. S. bongori is only very rarely implicated in infections. We here present the sequence of a clinical isolate from Switzerland, S. bongori strain N268-08.
TI  - Horizontally acquired glycosyltransferase operons drive salmonellae lipopolysaccharide diversity.
AB  - The immunodominant lipopolysaccharide is a key antigenic factor for Gram-negative pathogens such as salmonellae where it plays key roles in host adaptation, virulence, immune evasion, and persistence. Variation in the lipopolysaccharide is also the major differentiating factor that is used to classify Salmonella into over 2600 serovars as part of the Kaufmann-White scheme. While lipopolysaccharide diversity is generally associated with sequence variation in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis operon, extraneous genetic factors such as those encoded by the glucosyltransferase (gtr) operons provide further structural heterogeneity by adding additional sugars onto the O-antigen component of the lipopolysaccharide. Here we identify and examine the O-antigen modifying glucosyltransferase genes from the genomes of Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori serovars. We show that Salmonella generally carries between 1 and 4 gtr operons that we have classified into 10 families on the basis of gtrC sequence with apparent O-antigen modification detected for five of these families. The gtr operons localize to bacteriophage-associated genomic regions and exhibit a dynamic evolutionary history driven by recombination and gene shuffling events leading to new gene combinations. Furthermore, evidence of Dam- and OxyR-dependent phase variation of gtr gene expression was identified within eight gtr families. Thus, as O-antigen modification generates significant intra- and inter-strain phenotypic diversity, gtr-mediated modification is fundamental in assessing Salmonella strain variability. This will inform appropriate vaccine and diagnostic approaches, in addition to contributing to our understanding of host-pathogen interactions.
TI  - Evolutionary Genomics of Salmonella enterica Subspecies.
AB  - ABSTRACT Six subspecies are currently recognized in Salmonella enterica. Subspecies I (subspecies enterica) is responsible for nearly all infections in humans and warm-blooded animals, while five other subspecies are isolated principally from cold-blooded animals. We sequenced 21 phylogenetically diverse strains, including two representatives from each of the previously unsequenced five subspecies and 11 diverse new strains from S. enterica subspecies enterica, to put this species into an evolutionary perspective. The phylogeny of the subspecies was partly obscured by abundant recombination events between lineages and a relatively short period of time within which subspeciation took place. Nevertheless, a variety of different tree-building methods gave congruent evolutionary tree topologies for subspeciation. A total of 285 gene families were identified that were recruited into subspecies enterica, and most of these are of unknown function. At least 2,807 gene families were identified in one or more of the other subspecies that are not found in subspecies I or Salmonella bongori. Among these gene families were 13 new candidate effectors and 7 new candidate fimbrial clusters. A third complete type III secretion system not present in subspecies enterica (I) isolates was found in both strains of subspecies salamae (II). Some gene families had complex taxonomies, such as the type VI secretion systems, which were recruited from four different lineages in five of six subspecies. Analysis of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates indicated that the more-recently acquired regions in S. enterica are undergoing faster fixation rates than the rest of the genome. Recently acquired AT-rich regions, which often encode virulence functions, are under ongoing selection to maintain their high AT content. IMPORTANCE We have sequenced 21 new genomes which encompass the phylogenetic diversity of Salmonella, including strains of the previously unsequenced subspecies arizonae, diarizonae, houtenae, salamae, and indica as well as new diverse strains of subspecies enterica. We have deduced possible evolutionary paths traversed by this very important zoonotic pathogen and identified novel putative virulence factors that are not found in subspecies I. Gene families gained at the time of the evolution of subspecies enterica are of particular interest because they include mechanisms by which this subspecies adapted to warm-blooded hosts.
TI  - Structure, diversity, and mobility of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 7 family of integrative and conjugative elements within Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are self-mobile genetic elements found in the genomes of some bacteria. These elements may confer a fitness advantage upon their host bacteria through the cargo genes that they carry. Salmonella pathogenicity island 7 (SPI-7), found within some pathogenic strains of Salmonella enterica, possesses features indicative of an ICE and carries genes implicated in virulence. We aimed to identify and fully analyze ICEs related to SPI-7 within the genus Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae. We report the sequence of two novel SPI-7-like elements, found within strains of Salmonella bongori, which share 97% nucleotide identity over conserved regions with SPI-7 and with each other. Although SPI-7 within Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi appears to be fixed within the chromosome, we present evidence that these novel elements are capable of excision and self-mobility. Phylogenetic analyses show that these Salmonella mobile elements share an ancestor which existed approximately 3.6 to 15.8 million years ago. Additionally, we identified more distantly related ICEs, with distinct cargo regions, within other strains of Salmonella as well as within Citrobacter, Erwinia, Escherichia, Photorhabdus, and Yersinia species. In total, we report on a collection of 17 SPI-7 related ICEs within enterobacterial species, of which six are novel. Using comparative and mutational studies, we have defined a core of 27 genes essential for conjugation. We present a growing family of SPI-7-related ICEs whose mobility, abundance, and cargo variability indicate that these elements may have had a large impact on the evolution of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Evolution of Salmonella nomenclature: a critical note.
AB  - Salmonellae are widely distributed but nomenclaturally controversial pathogens of both humans and animals. Despite elaborate studies, much still remain to be discovered about these organisms. Although Salmonella nomenclature has proved to be rather complex, in 2005, Salmonella enterica finally gained official approval as the type species of the genus Salmonella. In addition, one other species has been approved and recognised in the genus Salmonella, namely, Salmonella bongori. New serovars (serotypes) are continually being discovered each year and reported in the journal Research in Microbiology. Salmonella serovars and their antigenic formulae are listed in the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme and updated by the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmonella at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.
TI  - Salmonella bongori provides insights into the evolution of the Salmonellae.
AB  - The genus Salmonella contains two species, S. bongori and S. enterica. Compared to the well-studied S. enterica there is a marked lack of information regarding the genetic makeup and diversity of S. bongori. S. bongori has been found predominantly associated with cold-blooded animals, but it can infect humans. To define the phylogeny of this species, and compare it to S. enterica, we have sequenced 28 isolates representing most of the known diversity of S. bongori. This cross-species analysis allowed us to confidently differentiate ancestral functions from those acquired following speciation, which include both metabolic and virulence-associated capacities. We show that, although S. bongori inherited a basic set of Salmonella common virulence functions, it has subsequently elaborated on this in a different direction to S. enterica. It is an established feature of S. enterica evolution that the acquisition of the type III secretion systems (T3SS-1 and T3SS-2) has been followed by the sequential acquisition of genes encoding secreted targets, termed effectors proteins. We show that this is also true of S. bongori, which has acquired an array of novel effector proteins (sboA-L). All but two of these effectors have no significant S. enterica homologues and instead are highly similar to those found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Remarkably, SboH is found to be a chimeric effector protein, encoded by a fusion of the T3SS-1 effector gene sopA and a gene highly similar to the EPEC effector nleH from enteropathogenic E. coli. We demonstrate that representatives of these new effectors are translocated and that SboH, similarly to NleH, blocks intrinsic apoptotic pathways while being targeted to the mitochondria by the SopA part of the fusion. This work suggests that S. bongori has inherited the ancestral Salmonella virulence gene set, but has adapted by incorporating virulence determinants that resemble those employed by EPEC.
TI  - The Salmonella enterica PhoP directly activates the horizontally acquired SPI-2 gene sseL and is functionally different from a S. bongori ortholog.
AB  - To establish a successful infection within the host, a pathogen must closely regulate multiple virulence traits to ensure their accurate temporal and spatial expression. As a highly adapted intracellular pathogen, Salmonella enterica has acquired during its evolution various virulence genes via numerous lateral transfer events, including the acquisition of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI-2) and its associated effectors. Beneficial use of horizontally acquired genes requires that their expression is effectively coordinated with the already existing virulence programs and the regulatory set-up in the bacterium. As an example for such a mechanism, we show here that the ancestral PhoPQ system of Salmonella enterica is able to regulate directly the SPI-2 effector gene sseL (encoding a secreted deubiquitinase) in an SsrB-independent manner and that PhoP plays a part in a feed-forward regulatory loop, which fine-tunes the cellular level of SseL. Additionally, we demonstrate the presence of conserved cis regulatory elements in the promoter region of sseL and show direct binding of purified PhoP to this region. Interestingly, in contrast to the S. enterica PhoP, an ortholog regulator from a S. bongori SARC 12 strain was found to be impaired in promoting transcription of sseL and other genes from the PhoP regulon. These findings have led to the identification of a previously uncharacterized residue in the DNA-binding domain of PhoP, which is required for the transcriptional activation of PhoP regulated genes in Salmonella spp. Collectively our data demonstrate an interesting interface between the acquired SsrB regulon and the ancestral PhoPQ regulatory circuit, provide novel insights into the function of PhoP, and highlight a mechanism of regulatory integration of horizontally acquired genes into the virulence network of Salmonella enterica.
TI  - Evaluation of the taxonomic utility of six-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in reconstructing Salmonella subspecies phylogeny.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) remains an important tool in the molecular epidemiological evaluation of strains emerging from disease outbreak clusters. Recent studies of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis have noted marked improvements in the discriminatory power of PFGE when combining band profiles from up to six restriction enzyme datasets into a single concatenated analysis. This approach has provided more accurate assignments of genetic relationships among closely related strains and allowed effective phylogenetic inference of host and geographical reservoirs. Although this approach enhances epidemiological congruence among closely related strains, it remains unclear to what extent six-enzyme PFGE pattern similarity reiterates evolutionary relatedness among more distantly related Salmonella strains (i.e., serovar or subspecies levels). Here, taxonomic accuracy of six-enzyme PFGE is tested phylogenetically across two distinct Salmonella enterica populations-Salmonella reference collection B (SARB), representing the breadth of taxonomic diversity of S. enterica subspecies I only, and Salmonella reference collection C (SARC), comprising the seven disparate subspecies of S. enterica plus S. bongori. Cladistic analysis of SAR strains revealed substantial polyphyly between the two strain collections such that numerous SARB strains clustered more closely with diverged SARC subspecies rather than with other members of subspecies I. Also, in several cases, SARC sibling strains from the same subspecies were evolutionary obscured-broken into distant locales on the most parsimonious six-enzyme trees. Genetic diversity among SARB and SARC strains was comparable at 45% and 47%, respectively, while congruence testing revealed discordance among individual enzyme datasets. While six-enzyme PFGE is effective in ascertaining accurate genetic relationships for more closely related strains (e.g., strains within the same serovar), reconstitution of evolutionarily meaningful strain groupings may be elusive for Salmonella at the serovar level and above. Thus, caution is warranted when applying PFGE with a limited number of enzymes as the primary phylogenetic marker in these instances.
TI  - Occurrence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella species in retail  meat products.
AB  - In the present study, a total of 225 retail meat products (poultry meat, ground beef, and beef samples) were tested for the prevalence of Salmonella. Of these, 50 (22.2%) were positive for Salmonella. Overall, the pathogen was detected in 22 (29.3%) samples of poultry meat (n = 75), 16 (21.3%) samples of ground beef (n = 75), and 12 (16%) samples of beef (n = 75). The most common isolate was Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (9.8%), followed by S. bongori species (8.9%) and S. enterica subsp. diarizonae (3.5%). The Salmonella strains isolated were also examined for antimicrobial resistance patterns and production of beta-lactamase enzyme. The resistance levels of the isolates against 14 different antimicrobial agents were tested by the disk diffusion method. None of the strains exhibited resistance to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, or levofloxacin. However, the highest resistance rates in the meat isolates were 64% each for ampicillin and cephazolin and 56% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. A total of 62% of the 50 Salmonella strains were multiresistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. The exhibited multiple resistance to four or more antimicrobial drugs was 32%. Furthermore, none of the isolates had beta-lactamase enzyme activity.
TI  - Real-time PCR detection of Salmonella species using a novel target: the outer membrane porin F gene (ompF).
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the outer membrane porin F gene (ompF) for the specific detection of Salmonella species by real-time PCR assay. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and eighteen isolates belonging to Salmonella enterica (subspecies I-VI) and Salmonella bongori were examined using primers designed to detect the ompF gene. The DNA of the bacteria was extracted from pure culture. The target was present in all the 218 Salmonella isolates including all the subspecies of Salm. enterica and Salm. bongori. The ompF gene was absent in 180 non-Salmonella strains tested. The limit of detection was determined to be three colony forming units per reaction in pure culture. In artificially contaminated food experiments with ten or less colony forming units per 25 g, the assay was successful in identifying the target in 100% of the samples after 22- to 24-h incubation in enrichment broth. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, the ompF gene is 100% inclusive for Salmonella species and 100% exclusive for non-Salmonella species for the strains tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: ompF gene was present in all the Salmonella strains tested and has the potential to be a good target for the rapid molecular identification of Salmonella.
TI  - Supplement 2003-2007 (No. 47) to the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme.
AB  - This supplement reports the characterization of 70 new Salmonella serovars recognized between 2003 and 2007 by the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Salmonella: 44 were assigned to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, 11 to subspecies salamae, 5 to subspecies arizonae, 8 to subspecies diarizonae, one to subspecies houtenae and one to Salmonella bongori. One new serovar, Mygdal, displayed a new H factor, H:z(91).
TI  - lac repressor is an antivirulence factor of Salmonella enterica: its role in the  evolution of virulence in Salmonella.
AB  - The genus Salmonella includes many pathogens of great medical and veterinary importance. Bacteria belonging to this genus are very closely related to those belonging to the genus Escherichia. lacZYA operon and lacI are present in Escherichia coli, but not in Salmonella enterica. It has been proposed that Salmonella has lost lacZYA operon and lacI during evolution. In this study, we have investigated the physiological and evolutionary significance of the absence of lacI in Salmonella enterica. Using murine model of typhoid fever, we show that the expression of LacI causes a remarkable reduction in the virulence of Salmonella enterica. LacI also suppresses the ability of Salmonella enterica to proliferate inside murine macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that LacI interferes with the expression of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. This effect was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Interestingly, we found that SBG0326 of Salmonella bongori is homologous to lacI of Escherichia coli. Salmonella bongori is the only other species of the genus Salmonella and it lacks the virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2. Overall, our results demonstrate that LacI is an antivirulence factor of Salmonella enterica and suggest that absence of lacI has facilitated the acquisition of virulence genes of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 in Salmonella enterica making it a successful systemic pathogen.
TI  - A novel multiplex PCR assay for Salmonella subspecies identification.
AB  - AIM: To develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay with six  primer pairs for Salmonella subspecies identification. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five primer pairs were chosen to detect the genes (fljB, mdcA, gatD, stn and STM4057) responsible for several phenotypic traits or encoding (sub) species-specific regions. A primer pair for invA was added to simultaneously detect Salmonella. The combination of these primer pairs was expected to give unique results to all subspecies, including Salmonella bongori. The multiplex PCR assay was optimized and evaluated with 53 Salmonella strains representing all S. enterica subspecies, S. bongori and five non-Salmonella strains. The multiplex PCR assay revealed that the genotypes were well correlated with the phenotypes in the Salmonella strains tested. The unique band patterns to their subspecies were generated from 94.3% (50/53) of the Salmonella strains, and no product from other strains by the multiplex PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex PCR assay we developed was found to be a rapid, specific and easy to perform method compared with traditional biochemical tests for Salmonella subspecies identification, especially for rapid screening of large numbers of samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The assay will be useful for characterizing Salmonella isolates from reptiles, which belong to various subspecies, and therefore add to the scientific understanding of reptile-associated Salmonellosis.
TI  - Population structure, origins and evolution of major Salmonella enterica clones.
AB  - The genus Salmonella consists of two species S. enterica and S. bongori. S. enterica has a well defined subspecies structure with seven subspecies consistently delineated by sequence variation. Frequency of recombination between subspecies and within a subspecies is markedly different. Subspecies I undergoes frequent recombination as demonstrated recently, demystifying the long-held belief that Salmonella is a highly clonal organism. The majority of disease causing serovars are from subspecies I with the most important serovars in human health being Typhimurium and Typhi. Typhimurium has developed considerable diversity and may be a very old serovar. The majority of the isolates belong to a single clonal complex by multilocus sequence typing. Typhimurium isolates are divided into phage types and some of the phage types do not have a single origin as determined using mutational changes. Phage type DT104 is heterogeneous and represented in multiple sequence types, with its multidrug-resistant variant most successful causing epidemics in many parts of the world. Typhi, a human restricted serovar, is relatively young compared to Typhimurium, and has a low level of sequence variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be very useful for typing and resolving relationships within Typhi. Genome sequences of 19 isolates revealed more than 1700 SNPs. The fully resolved phylogenetic tree allows one to trace the mutational changes occurred during clonal diversification. Genome wide SNPs have greatly enhanced our understanding of the evolution of Salmonella clones.
TI  - Development of an oligonucleotide microarray method for Salmonella serotyping.
AB  - Adequate identification of Salmonella enterica serovars is a prerequisite for any epidemiological investigation. This is traditionally obtained via a combination of biochemical and serological typing. However, primary strain isolation and traditional serotyping is time-consuming and faster methods would be desirable. A microarray, based on two housekeeping and two virulence marker genes (atpD, gyrB, fliC and fljB), has been developed for the detection and identification of the two species of Salmonella (S. enterica and S. bongori), the five subspecies of S. enterica (II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, VI) and 43 S. enterica ssp. enterica serovars (covering the most prevalent ones in Austria and the UK). A comprehensive set of probes (n = 240), forming 119 probe units, was developed based on the corresponding sequences of 148 Salmonella strains, successfully validated with 57 Salmonella strains and subsequently evaluated with 35 blind samples including isolated serotypes and mixtures of different serotypes. Results demonstrated a strong discriminatory ability of the microarray among Salmonella serovars. Threshold for detection was 1 colony forming unit per 25 g of food sample following overnight (14 h) enrichment.
TI  - Rapid classification and identification of salmonellae at the species and subspecies levels by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry .
AB  - Variations in the mass spectral profiles of multiple housekeeping proteins of 126 strains representing Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (subspecies I), S. enterica subsp. salamae (subspecies II), S. enterica subsp. arizonae (subspecies IIIa), S. enterica subsp. diarizonae (subspecies IIIb), S. enterica subsp. houtenae (subspecies IV), and S. enterica subsp. indica (subspecies VI), and Salmonella bongori were analyzed to obtain a phylogenetic classification of salmonellae based on whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometric bacterial typing. Sinapinic acid produced highly informative spectra containing a large number of biomarkers and covering a wide molecular mass range (2,000 to 40,000 Da). Genus-, species-, and subspecies-identifying biomarker ions were assigned on the basis of available genome sequence data for Salmonella, and more than 200 biomarker peaks, which corresponded mainly to abundant and highly basic ribosomal or nucleic acid binding proteins, were selected. A detailed comparative analysis of the biomarker profiles of Salmonella strains revealed sequence variations corresponding to single or multiple amino acid changes in multiple housekeeping proteins. The resulting mass spectrometry-based bacterial classification was very comparable to the results of DNA sequence-based methods. A rapid protocol that allowed identification of Salmonella subspecies in minutes was established.
TI  - Rapid discrimination of Salmonella isolates by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - A molecular typing technique was developed for the differentiation of Salmonella  isolates based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of amplicons generated by PCR. Amplicons from parts of the fimA (both the 5' and 3' ends), mdh, invA, and atpD genes were generated separately from a panel of Salmonella strains representing Salmonella bongori, and four subspecies and 17 serovars of Salmonella enterica. These amplicons were subjected to SSCP analysis for differentiation of the salmonellae on the basis of different conformational forms arising due to nucleotide sequence variations in the target genes. Several distinct SSCP banding patterns (a maximum of 14 each for atpD and fimA 3' end) were observed with this panel of Salmonella strains for amplicons generated from each target gene. The best discrimination of Salmonella subspecies and serovar was achieved from the SSCP analysis of a combination of at least three gene targets: atpD, invA, and either mdh or fimA 3' end. This demonstrates the applicability of SSCP analysis as an important additional method to classical typing approaches for the differentiation of foodborne Salmonella isolates. SSCP is simple to perform and should be readily transferable to food microbiology laboratories with basic PCR capability.
TI  - Molecular phylogeny of the salmonellae: relationships among Salmonella species and subspecies determined from four housekeeping genes and evidence of lateral gene transfer events.
AB  - The salmonellae are a diverse group of bacteria within the family Enterobacteriaceae that includes two species, Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori. In order to characterize the phylogenetic relationships of the species and subspecies of Salmonella, we analyzed four housekeeping genes, gapA, phoP, mdh and recA, comprising 3,459 bp of nucleotide sequence data for each isolate sequenced. Sixty-one isolates representing the most common serotypes of the seven subspecies of Salmonella enterica and six isolates of Salmonella bongori were included in this study. We present a robust phylogeny of the Salmonella species and subspecies that clearly defines the lineages comprising diphasic and monophasic subspecies. Evidence of intersubspecies lateral gene transfer of the housekeeping gene recA, which has not previously been reported, was obtained.
TI  - ClyA cytolysin from Salmonella: distribution within the genus, regulation of expression by SlyA, and pore-forming characteristics.
AB  - Functional homologs of the Escherichia coli cytolysin A (clyA, hlyE, sheA) gene have recently been detected in Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A). In this study, analysis of a collection of Salmonella strains showed that all S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains tested harbor an intact copy of the corresponding clyA variant, i.e. clyA(STy) and clyA(SPaA), respectively. On the other hand, clyA proved to be absent in the S. enterica serovar Paratyphi B and serovar Paratyphi C strains, in various non-typhoid S. enterica subsp. enterica serovars (Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Choleraesuis, Dublin, and Gallinarum), and in S. enterica subsp. arizonae and Salmonella bongori strains. When grown under normal laboratory conditions, the S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains produced only basal amounts of ClyA protein and did not exhibit a clyA-dependent hemolytic phenotype. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses as well as phenotypic data revealed, however, that the expression of clyA(STy) and clyA(SPaA) can be activated by the Salmonella transcription factor SlyA. In addition, osmotic protection assays and lipid bilayer experiments demonstrated that the hemolytic ClyA(STy) and ClyA(SPaA) proteins are effective pore-forming toxins which, similar to E. coli ClyA, generate large, stable, moderately cation-selective channels in target membranes. Taken together with our recent serological findings which have indicated that S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains produce substantial amounts of ClyA during human infection, these data suggest that ClyA may play a role in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A pathogenesis.
TI  - Primers specific for the fimbrial major subunit gene stdA can be used to detect Salmonella enterica serovars.
AB  - The feasibility of using two primers internal to the stdA gene (which encodes the fimbrial major subunit of the std fimbrial gene cluster in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi) to detect Salmonella by PCR was explored. The 518-bp stdA specific sequence was conserved among 268 strains from 45 serovars of S. enterica. One Salmonella bongori CCUG 30042 strain and 34 non-Salmonella strains did not possess this sequence. A sensitivity test revealed that the stdA-specific primer set detected 3.4 x 10(-1) pg of genomic DNA and 3.0 x 10(5) CFU/ml with serial dilutions of Salmonella Typhimurium cells. In vitro testing for specificity using pig carcass sponge samples contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium also was performed. An initial Salmonella Typhimurium inoculum of 4.4 x 10(1) CFU/ml in pig carcass exudates reached the stdA primer detection level after preenrichment in buffered peptone water at 37 degrees C for 18 h in the presence of indigenous non-Salmonella flora at 4.0 X 10(7) CFU/ml, but the detection level decreased to 4.4 x 10(0) CFU/ml after selective enrichment in Rappaport-Vassiliadis R10 broth for 18 h at 42 degrees C. The PCR method with primers specific for stdA is a quick and sensitive tool for detecting S. enterica, which is an important cause of foodborne disease.
TI  - Thermosensing coordinates a cis-regulatory module for transcriptional activation  of the intracellular virulence system in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - The expression of bacterial virulence genes is tightly controlled by the convergence of multiple extracellular signals. As a zoonotic pathogen, virulence gene regulation in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium must be responsive to multiple cues from the general environment as well as from multiple niches within animal and human hosts. Previous work has identified combined magnesium and phosphate limitation as an environmental cue that activates genes required for intracellular virulence. One unanswered question is how virulence genes that are expressed within the host are inhibited in non-host environments that satisfy the phosphate and magnesium limitation cues. We report here that thermosensing is the major mechanism controlling incongruous activation of the intracellular virulence phenotype. Bacteria grown at 30 degrees C or lower were unable to activate the intracellular type III secretion system even under strong inducing signals such as synthetic medium, contact with macrophages, and exposure to the murine gut. Thermoregulation was fully recapitulated in a Salmonella bongori strain engineered to contain the intracellular virulence genes of S. enterica sv. Typhimurium, suggesting that orthologous thermoregulators were available. Accordingly, virulence gene repression at the nonpermissive temperature required Hha and H-NS, two nucleoid-like proteins involved in virulence gene control. The use of combined environmental cues to control transcriptional "logic gates" allows for transcriptional selectivity of virulence genes that would otherwise be superfluous if activated in the non-host environment. Thus, thermosensing by Salmonella provides integrated control of host niche-specific virulence factors.
TI  - Salmonella: clinical importance and evolution of nomenclature.
AB  - Salmonella is an important pathogen for both humans and animals. Although the organism has been intensively studied during the last century, much remains to be learned about this pathogen. The complicated nomenclature system of Salmonella has long been a subject of discussion. In 2005, "Salmonella enterica" finally gained official approval as the type species of the genus Salmonella. The genus Salmonella also contains the species "Salmonella bongori" in addition to a new species, "Salmonella subterranean", which was recognized in 2005. Unlike other bacterial genera, Salmonella organisms are differentiated by serotyping analysis. Presently, new serotypes (serovars) are still being discovered each year, adding to the complexity of this large bacterial population. Despite the conserved genetic background, molecular analysis has indicated successful evolution of the Salmonella genome in response to the environment, particularly to the selective pressure from antimicrobial agents. Mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella are similar to the complex system reported for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is more likely to be mediated by bla(CTX-M) or ampC genes that are carried on plasmids. Plasmid-borne genes have increased efficacy in the dissemination of resistance determinants, resulting in increased antimicrobial resistance. To provide clinicians with up-to-date information on this important pathogen, the evolving nomenclature and clinical importance of Salmonella are reviewed.
TI  - Real-time PCR method for Salmonella spp. targeting the stn gene.
AB  - AIM: To develop a real-time PCR assay for Salmonella spp. targeting the stn gene. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of stn in the Salmonella bongori genome was found by a BLAST with Salmonella enterica stn sequence. Manual alignment of stn sequences showed that Salm. bongori had 88% sequence identity with Salm. enterica. Two primers (stnL-433 and stnR-561) and a probe (stnP-452) were designed to target conserved regions in stn and meet the requirements of a 5'-nuclease assay. The primers and probe were evaluated against 353 isolates, including 255 Salm. enterica representing 158 serotypes, 14 Salm. bongori representing 12 serotypes and 84 non-Salmonella representing 56 species from 31 genera. All isolates were correctly identified, with the exception of three isolates of Citrobacter amalonaticus, which gave false positives. The limit of detection with cultured Salmonella was 3 CFU per reaction. CONCLUSIONS: The stn real-time PCR method had 100% inclusivity, 96.4% exclusivity and a level of detection of 3 CFU per reaction for cultured Salmonella spp. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study showed that stn is present in Salm. bongori and is a valid target for both species of Salmonella. The Salmonella s tn real-time PCR is a useful method for identifying Salmonella spp.
TI  - Linkage of avian and reproductive tract tropism with sequence divergence adjacent to the 5S ribosomal subunit rrfH of Salmonella enterica.
AB  - The 183 bp between the end of the 23S rrlH rRNA gene and the start of the 5S rrfH rRNA gene (ISR-1) and the 197 bp between the end of the rrfH rRNA gene and the start of the transfer RNA aspU (ISR-2) of Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serotypes Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Pullorum, Heidelberg, Gallinarum, Typhi and Choleraesuis were compared. ISR-1s of D1 serotypes (Pullorum, Gallinarum and Enteritidis), B serotypes (Typhimurium and Heidelberg) and the C2 serotype Newport and the enteric fever pathogens serotype A Paratyphi and serotype D1 Typhi formed three clades, respectively. ISR-2 further differentiated the avian-adapted serotype Gallinarum from avian-adapted Pullorum and Salmonella bongori from S. enterica. The results suggest that serotypes Heidelberg and Choleraesuis share some evolutionary trends with egg-contaminating serotypes. In addition, ISR-1 and ISR-2 sequences that confirm serotype appear to be linked to clinically relevant host associations of the Salmonellae.
TI  - Comparison of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 and non-LT2 salmonella  genomic sequences, and genotyping of salmonellae by using PCR.
AB  - Genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 expected to be specifically  present in Salmonella were selected using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program. The 152 selected genes were compared with 11 genomic sequences of Salmonella serovars, including Salmonella enterica subsp. I and IIIb and Salmonella bongori (V), and were clustered into 17 groups by their comparison patterns. A total of 38 primer pairs were constructed to represent each of the 17 groups, and PCR was performed with various Salmonella subspecies including Salmonella enterica subsp. I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, VI, and V to evaluate a comprehensive DNA-based scheme for identification of Salmonella subspecies and the major disease-causing Salmonella serovars. Analysis of PCR results showed that Salmonella enterica subsp. I was critically divided from other subspecies, and Salmonella strains belonging to S. enterica subsp. I were clustered based on their serovars. In addition, genotypic relationships within S. enterica subsp. I by PCR results were investigated. Also, Salmonella signature genes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium signature genes, and Salmonella enterica subsp. I signature genes were demonstrated based on their PCR results. The described PCR method suggests a rapid and convenient method for identification of Salmonella serovars that can be used by nonspecialized laboratories. Genome sequence comparison can be a useful tool in epidemiologic and taxonomic studies of Salmonella.
TI  - Distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  - Bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, B, C, and D, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. There are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene B (homology to ubiX) and C (ubiD) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene D, are not numerous ( approximately 15). The occurrence of the entire BCD gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in Sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement CDB), Streptomyces sp. D7, Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica, S. paratyphi, S. typhimurium, S. bongori, and S. diarizonae. The corresponding genes from S. hydroxybenzoicus, B. subtilis, Streptomyces sp. D7, E. coli O157:H7, K. pneumoniae, and S. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in E. coli DH5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.
TI  - Molecular characterization of a new serovar of Salmonella bongori 13,22:z39:- isolated from a lizard.
AB  - Three Salmonella strains isolated from a lizard (Gallotia simoni) in the "Isla del Hierro" (Canary Islands, Spain) were serotyped as Salmonella bongori serotype 13,22:z39:-, which has not been described in the Kauffmann-White scheme of Salmonella serovars. In order to shed light on the assignment of those strains to the S. bongori species, several genes were amplified and/or sequenced. The iroB gene has been reported to be present only in S. enterica, while the invA gene has been described as being a helpful tool in distinguishing Salmonella from other bacterial species. Both genes were amplified and, as expected, only invA could be amplified. The fliC gene, encoding the phase 1 flagellin fljB gene, encoding phase 2 flagellin, and the gapA gene, which is believed to present polymorphic alleles among different subspecies, were amplified and sequenced. The sequence obtained from fliC(z39) matched with the sequences fliC(z39) obtained from other serovars. The sequence obtained from gapA clustered into the S. bongori group when it was compared to others previously described. We conclude that these three isolates are members of the S. bongori species representing a new serovar that will be described in the next supplement to the Kauffmann-White scheme.
TI  - Supplement 2002 (no. 46) to the Kauffmann-White scheme.
AB  - This supplement reports the characterization of 18 new Salmonella serovars recognized in 2002 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmonella: 12 were assigned to S. enterica subspecies enterica, 2 to subspecies salamae, 2 to subspecies diarizonae, 1 to subspecies houtenae and 1 to S. bongori.
TI  - Population structure of Salmonella investigated by amplified fragment length polymorphism.
AB  - AIMS: This study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) in determining the population structure of Salmonella. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 89 strains were subjected to AFLP analysis using the enzymes BglII and BspDI, a combination that is novel in Salmonella. Both species S. bongori and S. enterica and all subsp. of S. enterica were represented with emphasis on S. enterica subsp. enterica using a local strain collection and strains from the Salmonella Reference Collection B (SARB). The amplified fragments were used in a band-based cluster analysis. The tree resulting from the subgroup analysis clearly separated all subgroups with high bootstrap values with the species S. bongori being the most distantly related of the subgroups. The tree resulting from the analysis of the SARB collection showed that some serotypes are very clonal whereas others are highly divergent. CONCLUSIONS: AFLP clearly clustered strains representing the subgroups of Salmonella together with high bootstrap values and the serotypes of subspecies enterica were divided into polyphyletic or monophyletic types corresponding well with multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) and sequence-based studies of the population structure in Salmonella. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: AFLP with the enzyme combination BglII and BspDI allows discrimination of individual strains and provides evidence for the usefulness of AFLP in studies of population structure in Salmonella.
TI  - Oral immunization with an rfaH mutant elicits protection against salmonellosis in mice.
AB  - Loss of the transcriptional antiterminator RfaH results in virulence attenuation  (>10(4)-fold increase in 50% lethal dose) of the archetypal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 by both orogastric and intraperitoneal routes of infection in BALB/c mice. Oral immunization with the mutant efficiently protects mice against a subsequent oral infection with the wild-type strain. Interestingly, in vitro immunoreactivity is not confined to strain SL1344; rather, it is directed also towards other serovars of S. enterica and even Salmonella bongori strains.
TI  - Functional transfer of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 to Salmonella bongori and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) has a central role in systemic infections by Salmonella enterica and for the intracellular phenotype. Intracellular S. enterica uses the SPI2-encoded T3SS to translocate a set of effector proteins into the host cell, which modify host cell functions, enabling intracellular survival and replication of the bacteria. We sought to determine whether specific functions of the SPI2-encoded T3SS can be transferred to heterologous hosts Salmonella bongori and Escherichia coli Mutaflor, species that lack the SPI2 locus and loci encoding effector proteins. The SPI2 virulence locus was cloned and functionally expressed in S. bongori and E. coli. Here, we demonstrate that S. bongori harboring the SPI2 locus is capable of secretion of SPI2 substrate proteins under culture conditions, as well as of translocation of effector proteins under intracellular conditions. An SPI2-mediated cellular phenotype was induced by S. bongori harboring the SPI2 if the sifA locus was cotransferred. An interference with the host cell microtubule cytoskeleton, a novel SPI2-dependent phenotype, was observed in epithelial cells infected with S. bongori harboring SPI2 without additional effector genes. S. bongori harboring SPI2 showed increased intracellular persistence in a cell culture model, but SPI2 transfer was not sufficient to confer to S. bongori systemic pathogenicity in a murine model. Transfer of SPI2 to heterologous hosts offers a new tool for the study of SPI2 functions and the phenotypes of individual effectors.
TI  - Molecular and phenotypic analysis of the CS54 island of Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium: identification of intestinal colonization and persistence determinants.
AB  - The shdA gene is carried on a 25-kb genetic island at centisome 54 (CS54 island)  of the Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium chromosome. In addition to shdA, the CS54 island of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 contains four open reading frames designated ratA, ratB, sivI, and sivH. DNA hybridization analysis revealed that the CS54 island is comprised of two regions with distinct phylogenetic distribution within the genus Salmonella. Homologues of shdA and ratB were detected only in serotypes of Salmonella enterica subsp. I. In contrast, sequences hybridizing with ratA, sivI, and sivH were present in S. enterica subsp. II and S. bongori in addition to S. enterica subsp. I. Deletion of the ratA and sivI genes did not alter the ability of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium to colonize the organs of mice. Insertional inactivation of the sivH gene resulted in defective colonization of the Peyer's patches of the terminal ileum but normal colonization of the cecum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Deletion of the shdA gene resulted in decreased colonization of the cecum and Peyer's patches of the terminal ileum and colonization to a lesser degree in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen 5 days post-oral inoculation of mice. A strain containing a deletion in the ratB gene exhibited a defect for the colonization of the cecum but not of the Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. The shdA and ratB deletion strains exhibited a shedding defect in mice, whereas the sivH deletion strain was shed at numbers similar to the wild type. These data suggest that colonization of the murine cecum is required for efficient fecal shedding in mice.
TI  - Genomic comparison of Salmonella enterica serovars and Salmonella bongori by use  of an S. enterica serovar typhimurium DNA microarray.
AB  - The genus Salmonella consists of over 2,200 serovars that differ in their host range and ability to cause disease despite their close genetic relatedness. The genetic factors that influence each serovar's level of host adaptation, how they evolved or were acquired, their influence on the evolution of each serovar, and the phylogenic relationships between the serovars are of great interest as they provide insight into the mechanisms behind these differences in host range and disease progression. We have used an Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium spotted DNA microarray to perform genomic hybridizations of various serovars and strains of both S. enterica (subspecies I and IIIa) and Salmonella bongori to gain insight into the genetic organization of the serovars. Our results are generally consistent with previously published DNA association and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis data. Our findings also reveal novel information. We observe a more distant relationship of serovar Arizona (subspecies IIIa) from the subspecies I serovars than previously measured. We also observe variability in the Arizona SPI-2 pathogenicity island, indicating that it has evolved in a manner distinct from the other serovars. In addition, we identify shared genetic features of S. enterica serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, and Sendai that parallel their unique ability to cause enteric fever in humans. Therefore, whereas the taxonomic organization of Salmonella into serogroups provides a good first approximation of genetic relatedness, we show that it does not account for genomic changes that contribute to a serovar's degree of host adaptation.
TI  - An improved 16S rRNA based PCR method for the specific detection of Salmonella enterica.
AB  - A molecular method for the detection of Salmonella enterica strains based on 16S  rRNA sequence analysis was developed by a modification of the previously described PCR primer 16SFI [J. Appl. Bacteriol. 80 (1996) 659], which was combined with a newly developed primer annealing at the position 66-82. Only approximately two thirds of now determined Salmonella 16S rRNA sequences contained a region identical to the 16SFI primer sequence and the reverse primer 16SIII was also not specific. Combined, these two primers have been claimed to allow the specific detection of all Salmonella; however, in this study, they did not recognize S. bongori and 3 out of 78 tested S. enterica strains. They also identified some of the tested Enterobacter cloacae strains as Salmonella. On the contrary, the new primer pair, MINf and MINr, made it possible to recognize correctly all of the 78 tested S. enterica strains, representing 31 different Salmonella serovars. None of the 23 non-Salmonella strains from the related gamma-proteobacterial genera was incorrectly recognized as belonging to S. enterica.
TI  - Evolutionary genomics of Salmonella: gene acquisitions revealed by microarray analysis.
AB  - The presence of homologues of Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium LT2 genes was assessed in 22 other Salmonella including members of all seven subspecies and Salmonella bongori. Genomes were hybridized to a microarray of over 97% of the 4,596 annotated ORFs in the LT2 genome. A phylogenetic tree based on homologue content, relative to LT2, was largely concordant with previous studies using sequence information from several loci. Based on the topology of this tree, homologues of genes in LT2 acquired by various clades were predicted including 513 homologues acquired by the ancestor of all Salmonella, 111 acquired by S. enterica, 105 by diphasic Salmonella, and 216 by subspecies 1, most of which are of unknown function. Because this subspecies is responsible for almost all Salmonella infections of mammals and birds, these genes will be of particular interest for further mechanistic studies. Overall, a high level of gene gain, loss, or rapid divergence was predicted along all lineages. For example, at least 425 close homologues of LT2 genes may have been laterally transferred into Salmonella and then between Salmonella lineages.
TI  - Salmonella effectors within a single pathogenicity island are differentially expressed and translocated by separate type III secretion systems.
AB  - Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are large DNA segments in the genomes of bacterial pathogens that encode virulence factors. Five PAIs have been identified in the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica. Two of these PAIs, Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and SPI-2, encode type III secretion systems (TTSS), which are essential virulence determinants. These 'molecular syringes' inject effectors directly into the host cell, whereupon they manipulate host cell functions. These effectors are either encoded with their respective TTSS or scattered elsewhere on the Salmonella chromosome. Importantly, SPI-1 and SPI-2 are expressed under distinct environmental conditions: SPI-1 is induced upon initial contact with the host cell, whereas SPI-2 is induced intracellularly. Here, we demonstrate that a single PAI, in this case SPI-5, can encode effectors that are induced by distinct regulatory cues and targeted to different TTSS. SPI-5 encodes the SPI-1 TTSS translocated effector, SigD/SopB. In contrast, we report that the adjacently encoded effector PipB is part of the SPI-2 regulon. PipB is translocated by the SPI-2 TTSS to the Salmonella-containing vacuole and Salmonella-induced filaments. We also show that regions of SPI-5 are not conserved in all Salmonella spp. Although sigD/sopB is present in all Salmonella spp., pipB is not found in Salmonella bongori, which also lacks a functional SPI-2 TTSS. Thus, we demonstrate a functional and regulatory cross-talk between three chromosomal PAIs, SPI-1, SPI-2 and SPI-5, which has significant implications for the evolution and role of PAIs in bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Supplement 1999 (no. 43) to the Kauffmann-White scheme.
AB  - This supplement reports the characterization of 26 new Salmonella serovars recognized in 1999 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmonella: 15 were assigned to S. enterica subsp. enterica, seven to subspecies salamae, two to subspecies diarizonae, and one to subsp. houtenae; and one to S. bongori. In addition, the antigenic factor H:z89 is described.
TI  - Induction of Salmonella enterotoxin (stn) gene expression by epithelial cells (IEC-6).
AB  - Prevalence of Salmonella enterotoxin (stn) gene among Salmonella enterica and S.  bongori was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene probe and its status of phenotypic expression was examined on chinese hamster ovary cells by cultivating the strains with conventional method for enterotoxin production and by cultivating the organisms in contact with intestinal epithelial cells of rats (IEC-6). All the 19 strains and serovars of S. enterica such as Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Newport, Weltevreden, Indiana, Gallinarum and Kentucky were found to carry stn gene as examined by PCR and gene probe but only a limited number of strains (13 out of 19) expressed phenotypically the enterotoxin when cultured by conventional method. Cultivation of organisms in contact with epithelial cells induced expression of stn gene phenotypically in all the 19 strains. In contrast to S. enterica, strains of S. bongori were found neither genotypically (stn) nor phenotypically (Stn) positive.
TI  - The shdA gene is restricted to serotypes of Salmonella enterica subspecies I and  contributes to efficient and prolonged fecal shedding.
AB  - Little is known about factors which enable Salmonella serotypes to circulate within populations of livestock and domestic fowl. We have identified a DNA region which is present in Salmonella serotypes commonly isolated from livestock and domestic fowl (S. enterica subspecies I) but absent from reptile-associated Salmonella serotypes (S. bongori and S. enterica subspecies II to VII). This DNA region was cloned from Salmonella serotype Typhimurium and sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 6,105-bp open reading frame, designated shdA, whose product's deduced amino acid sequence displayed homology to that of AIDA-I from diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, MisL of serotype Typhimurium, and IcsA of Shigella flexneri. The shdA gene was located adjacent to xseA at 52 min, in a 30-kb DNA region which is not present in Escherichia coli K-12. A serotype Typhimurium shdA mutant was shed with the feces in reduced numbers and for a shorter period of time compared to its isogenic parent. A possible role for the shdA gene during the expansion in host range of S. enterica subspecies I to include warm-blooded vertebrates is discussed.
TI  - Recognition of nomenclatural standing of Salmonella typhi (Approved Lists 1980),  Salmonella enteritidis (Approved Lists 1980) and Salmonella typhimurium (Approved Lists 1980), and conservation of the specific epithets enteritidis and typhimurium. Request for an opinion.
AB  - In 1994, the Judicial Commission of the ICSB announced that Le Minor and Popoff's Request for an Opinion in 1987 to designate Salmonella enterica sp. nov., nom. rev. as the type and only species of the genus Salmonella was denied. Thus, the current species of the genus Salmonella are Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella choleraesuis (including six subspecies) and Salmonella bongori, with the type species, S. choleraesuis (Smith 1894) Weldin 1927 (Approved Lists 1980). Because the decision of the Judicial Commission about the request by Le Minor in 1987 was suspended for 7 years, the non-validated name 'S. enterica' has been used among microbiologists and has caused confusion in the nomenclature of Salmonella. In order to overcome such confusion, and because of their importance as human pathogens, we herein propose to recognize the nomenclatural status of S. typhi, S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium as species and request to issue an Opinion to conserve the specific epithets enteritidis and typhimurium in the species names Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - Comparison of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome with sampled genomes of a Klebsiella pneumoniae and three salmonella enterica serovars, Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi.
AB  - The Escherichia coli K-12 genome (ECO) was compared with the sampled genomes of the sibling species Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium, Typhi and Paratyphi A (collectively referred to as SAL) and the genome of the close outgroup Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN). There are at least 160 locations where sequences of >400 bp are absent from ECO but present in the genomes of all three SAL and 394 locations where sequences are present in ECO but close homologs are absent in all SAL genomes. The 394 sequences in ECO that do not occur in SAL contain 1350 (30.6%) of the 4405 ECO genes. Of these, 1165 are missing from both SAL and KPN. Most of the 1165 genes are concentrated within 28 regions of 10-40 kb, which consist almost exclusively of such genes. Among these regions were six that included previously identified cryptic phage. A hypothetical ancestral state of genomic regions that differ between ECO and SAL can be inferred in some cases by reference to the genome structure in KPN and the more distant relative Yersinia pestis. However, many changes between ECO and SAL are concentrated in regions where all four genera have a different structure. The rate of gene insertion and deletion is sufficiently high in these regions that the ancestral state of the ECO/SAL lineage cannot be inferred from the present data. The sequencing of other closely related genomes, such as S.bongori or Citrobacter, may help in this regard.
TI  - Dot-ELISA for detection of Salmonella enterotoxin.
AB  - Nineteen strains of Salmonella enterica belonging to seven serovars and two strains of S. bongori were investigated for enterotoxin production by the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell assay and Dot-ELISA. All the 19 strains were found to carry stn gene when tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers for stn sequence. Thirteen strains (68.42%) were found to produce Salmonella enterotoxin (Stn) when tested by the CHO cell assay. Dot-ELISA could detect Stn in 16 strains (84.21%). Dot-ELISA may be preferred over other assays due to its low cost and simplicity in performance.
TI  - Prevalence of enterotoxin gene (stn) among different serovars of Salmonella.
AB  - The prevalence of Salmonella enterotoxin (stn) gene among different Salmonella serovars by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its status of expression on the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were investigated. All the 26 strains of Salmonella enterica such as serovars Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Dublin, Typhi, Newport, Weltevreden, Gallinarum, etc. investigated in this study were found to carry stn gene as examined by the PCR and gene probe. However, only a limited number of stn positive strains (34.6%) were found to express phenotypically the Salmonella enterotoxin (Stn) as tested by the CHO cell assay. The strains of S. bongori were found to be negative for Stn production both genotypically and phenotypically.
TI  - Genomic subtraction identifies Salmonella typhimurium prophages, F-related plasmid sequences, and a novel fimbrial operon, stf, which are absent in Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium causes systemic and fatal infection in inbred mice, while  the related serotype Salmonella typhi is avirulent for mammals other than humans. In order to identify genes from the virulent strain S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 that are absent in S. typhi Ty2, and therefore might be involved in S. typhimurium mouse virulence, a PCR-supported genomic subtractive hybridization procedure was employed. We have identified a novel putative fimbrial operon, stfACDEFG, located at centisome 5 of the S. typhimurium chromosome, which is absent in S. typhi, Salmonella arizonae, and Salmonella bongori but was detected in several other Salmonella serotypes. The fimbrial genes represent a genomic insertion in S. typhimurium compared to the respective region between fhuB and hemL in Escherichia coli K-12. In addition, the subtraction procedure yielded F plasmid-related sequences from the S. typhimurium virulence plasmid, a number of DNA fragments representing parts of lambdoid prophages and putative sugar transporters, and several fragments with unknown sequences. The majority of subtracted chromosomal sequences map to three distinct locations, around centisomes 5, 27, and 57.
TI  - Ferrioxamine-mediated Iron(III) utilization by Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Utilization of ferrioxamines as sole sources of iron distinguishes Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis from a number of related species, including Escherichia coli. Ferrioxamine supplements have therefore been used in preenrichment and selection media to increase the bacterial growth rate while selectivity is maintained. We characterized the determinants involved in utilization of ferrioxamines B, E, and G by S. enterica serotype Typhimurium by performing siderophore cross-feeding bioassays. Transport of all three ferric siderophores across the outer membrane was dependent on the FoxA receptor encoded by the Fur-repressible foxA gene. However, only the transport of ferrioxamine G was dependent on the energy-transducing protein TonB, since growth stimulation of a tonB strain by ferrioxamines B and E was observed, albeit at lower efficiencies than in the parental strain. Transport across the inner membrane was dependent on the periplasmic binding protein-dependent ABC transporter complex comprising FhuBCD, as has been reported for other hydroxamate siderophores of enteric bacteria. The distribution of the foxA gene in the genus Salmonella, as indicated by DNA hybridization studies and correlated with the ability to utilize ferrioxamine E, was restricted to subspecies I, II, and IIIb, and this gene was absent from subspecies IIIa, IV, VI, and VII (formerly subspecies IV) and Salmonella bongori (formerly subspecies V). S. enterica serotype Typhimurium mutants with either a transposon insertion or a defined nonpolar frameshift (+2) mutation in the foxA gene were not able to utilize any of the three ferrioxamines tested. A strain carrying the nonpolar foxA mutation exhibited a significantly reduced ability to colonize rabbit ileal loops compared to the foxA+ parent. In addition, a foxA mutant was markedly attenuated in mice inoculated by either the intragastric or intravenous route. Mice inoculated with the foxA mutant were protected against subsequent challenge by the foxA+ parent strain.
TI  - Analysis of the type 1 pilin gene cluster fim in Salmonella: its distinct evolutionary histories in the 5' and 3' regions.
AB  - The type 1 pilin encoded by fim is present in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella natural isolates, but several lines of evidence indicate that similarities at the fim locus may be an example of independent acquisition rather than common ancestry. For example, the fim gene cluster is found at different chromosomal locations and with distinct gene orders in these closely related species. In this work we examined the fim gene cluster of Salmonella, the genes of which show high nucleotide sequence divergence from their E. coli counterparts, as well as a different G+C content and codon usage. DNA hybridization analysis revealed that, among the salmonellae, the fim gene cluster is present in all isolates of S. enterica but is absent from S. bongori. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the fimA and fimI genes yield an estimate of phylogeny that is in satisfactory congruence with housekeeping and other virulence genes examined in this species. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses of the fimZ, fimY, and fimW genes indicate that horizontal transfer of this region has occurred more than once. There is also size variation in the fimZ, fimY, and fimW intergenic regions in the 3' region, and these genes are absent in isolate S2983 of subspecies IIIa. Interestingly, the G+C contents of the fimZ, fimY, and fimW genes are less than 46%, which is considerably lower than those of the other six genes of the fim cluster. This study demonstrates that horizontal transmission of all or part of the same gene cluster can occur repeatedly, with the result that different regions of a single gene cluster may have different evolutionary histories.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella based on rRNA sequences.
AB  - To establish the phylogenetic relationships between the subspecies of Salmonella  enterica (official name Salmonella choleraesuis), Salmonella bongori and related members of Enterobacteriaceae, sequence comparison of rRNA was performed by maximum-likelihood analysis. The two Salmonella species were separated by 16S rRNA analysis and found to be closely related to the Escherichia coli and Shigella complex by both 16S and 23S rRNA analyses. The diphasic serotypes S. enterica subspp. I and VI were separated from the monophasic serotypes subspp. IIIa and IV, including S. bongori, by 23S rRNA sequence comparison.
TI  - Salmonella virulence plasmid. Modular acquisition of the spv virulence region by  an F-plasmid in Salmonella enterica subspecies I and insertion into the chromosome of subspecies II, IIIa, IV and VII isolates.
AB  - The spv operon is common to all Salmonella virulence plasmids. DNA hybridization  analysis indicates that the spv region is limited in distribution to serovars of Salmonella enterica subspecies I, II, IIIa, IV, and VII and is absent from Salmonella bongori isolates. Among strains of subspecies II, IIIa, and VII, all isolates examined contained sequences that hybridized with the spv region. However, among isolates of subspecies I, DNA sequences capable of hybridizing with the spv region were found in some isolates of certain serovars. Furthermore, in isolates of subspecies I, the virulence plasmid was found in the same set of isolates as an F-related plasmid, as determined by the presence of the spv region of the virulence plasmid and the finO, traD, and repA sequences of the F-plasmid. The concordance of the virulence plasmid and all three F-plasmid sequences in subspecies I serovar Choleraesuis, Paratyphi, and Typhimurium is most easily explained if the spv region is carried in an F-related plasmid in these isolates. In contrast, among S. enterica subspecies II, IIIa, IV, and VII, the isolates that contain spv sequences did not hybridize with an F-related plasmid or any other identifiable plasmid. With the use of pulse-field gel electrophoresis, the spv region in subspecies II, IIIa, and VII was found to be encoded on the chromosome. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of spv among Salmonella isolates and comparative nucleotide sequence analysis of spvA and spvC suggests that the spv region was acquired very recently, after speciation of the salmonellae.
TI  - Phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella based on DNA sequence comparison of atpD encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase.
AB  - DNA sequences covering 57% of atpD encoding the beta subunit of ATP synthase were determined for 16 strains of Salmonella enterica, two strains of S. bongori, and one strain each of Citrobacter freundii and Yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes sequences. The phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of S. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies II which were unsupported by a common node. The two serotypes of S. bongori were separated from S. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies II. A tight relationship was found between S. enterica subspecies IIIa consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies IIIb consisting of diphasic serotypes. This is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping genes and the 23S rRNA gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.
TI  - IroN, a novel outer membrane siderophore receptor characteristic of Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Speciation in enterobacteria involved horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, analysis of genes acquired by horizontal transfer that are present in one species but not its close relatives is expected to give insights into how new bacterial species were formed. In this study we characterize iroN, a gene located downstream of the iroBC operon in the iroA locus of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Like iroBC, the iroN gene is present in all phylogenetic lineages of S. enterica but is absent from closely related species such as Salmonella bongori or Escherichia coli. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of iroN with other proteins suggested that this gene encodes an outer membrane siderophore receptor protein. Mutational analysis in S. enterica and expression in E. coli identified a 78-kDa outer membrane protein as the iroN gene product. When introduced into an E. coli fepA cir fiu aroB mutant on a cosmid, iroN mediated utilization of structurally related catecholate siderophores, including N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-serine, myxochelin A, benzaldehyde-2,3-dihydroxybenzhydrazone, 2-N,6-N-bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-lysine, 2-N,6-N-bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-lysine amide, and enterochelin. These results suggest that the iroA locus functions in iron acquisition in S. enterica.
TI  - Evaluation of a fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probe targeting 23S rRNA for in situ detection of Salmonella serovars in paraffin-embedded tissue sections and their rapid identification in bacterial smears.
AB  - A method for the detection of Salmonella based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been developed and applied for the direct detection of Salmonella in pure cultures and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. On the basis of the 23S rRNA gene sequences representing all of the S. enterica subspecies and S. bongori, an 18-mer oligonucleotide probe was selected. The specificity of the probe was tested by in situ hybridization to bacterial cell smears of pure cultures. Forty-nine of 55 tested Salmonella serovars belonging to subspecies I, II, IIIb, IV, and VI hybridized with the probe. The probe did not hybridize to serovars from subspecies IIIa (S. arizonae) or to S. bongori. No cross-reaction to 64 other strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae or 18 other bacterial strains outside this family was observed. The probe was tested with sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from experimentally infected mice or from animals with a history of clinical salmonellosis. In these tissue sections the probe hybridized specifically to Salmonella serovars, allowing for the detection of single bacterial cells. The development of a fluorescence-labelled specific oligonucleotide probe makes the FISH technique a promising tool for the rapid identification of S. enterica in bacterial smears, as well as for the detection of S. enterica in histological tissue sections.
TI  - Rapid detection of Salmonella enterica with primers specific for iroB.
AB  - The iroB gene of Salmonella enterica is absent from the chromosome of the related organism Escherichia coli. We determined the distribution of this gene among 150 bacterial isolates, representing 51 serotypes of different Salmonella species and subspecies and 8 other bacterial species which are frequent contaminants during routine enrichment procedures by Southern hybridization. An iroB-specific DNA probe detected homologous sequences in all strains of S. enterica, including serotypes of S. enterica subsp. enterica (I), salamae (II), diarizonae (IIIb), and houtenae (IV). No hybridization signal was obtained with strains of Salmonella bongori or other bacterial species. In contrast, hybridization with a DNA probe specific for purD, a purine biosynthesis gene, detected homologs in all bacterial species tested. Primers specific for iroB were used to amplify this gene from 197 bacterial isolates by PCR. The iroB gene could be PCR amplified from S. enterica subsp. enterica (I), salamae (II), diarizonae (IIIb), houtenae (IV), arizonae (IIIa), and indica (VI), but not from S. bongori or other bacterial species. Thus, PCR amplification of iroB can be used to distinguish between S. enterica and other bacterial species, including S. bongori. A combination of preenrichment in buffered peptone water supplemented with ferrioxamine E and amplification of iroB by magnetic immuno-PCR allowed detection of S. enterica in albumen within 24 h. In conclusion, PCR amplification of iroB is a new sensitive and selective method which has the potential to rapidly detect S. enterica serotypes.
TI  - Analysis of the boundaries of Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 and the corresponding chromosomal region of Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - We recently identified a pathogenicity island (SPI2) located at 30.7 centisomes on the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome. SPI2 contains genes encoding a type III secretion system whose function is distinct from that of the type III secretion system encoded by a pathogenicity island (SPI1) at 63 centisomes which is involved in epithelial cell entry. An analysis of the boundaries of SPI2 and comparison with the corresponding region of the Escherichia coli chromosome revealed that SPI2 inserted adjacent to the tRNA(Val) gene. The E. coli chromosome contains 9 kb of DNA at the region corresponding to the SPI2 insertion point which appears to be absent in S. typhimurium. The distribution of SPI1 and SPI2 was examined in various Salmonella isolates. In contrast to type III secretion system genes of SPI1, those of SPI2 are not present in Salmonella bongori, which diverged at the first branch point in the Salmonella lineage. These and other data indicate that SPI2 was acquired by a Salmonella strain already harboring SPI1 by horizontal transfer from an unknown source.
TI  - Distribution of pathogenicity islands in Salmonella spp.
AB  - We investigated the phylogenetic distribution of the SPI-1 and SPI-2 pathogenicity islands in Salmonella spp. SPI-1 was present in representatives of all eight subspecific groups, but no SPI-2-hybridizing sequences were detected in group V (S. bongori). Our data suggest that SPI-2 was acquired by S. enterica after its split from S. bongori.
TI  - Molecular genetic relationships of the salmonellae.
AB  - A multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis of 96 strains of the salmonellae distinguished 80 electrophoretic types (ETs) and placed them in eight groups, seven of which correspond precisely to the seven taxonomic groups (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, V, and VI) previously defined on the basis of biotype and genomic DNA hybridization. In addition, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis identified an eighth distinctive group (designated VII) composed of five strains that had been assigned to group IV on the basis of biotype. An analysis of variation in the combined nucleotide sequences of five housekeeping genes among 16 strains representing all eight groups yielded estimates of overall genetic relationships that are fully consistent with those indicated by DNA hybridization. However, the nucleotide sequences of seven invasion genes (inv/spa) in the strains of group VII were closely similar to those of strains of group IV. These findings are interpreted as evidence that group VII represents an old, differentiated lineage to which one or more large parts of the chromosomal genome of the group IV lineage, including the 40-kb segment on which the invasion genes are located, have been horizontally transferred. All lines of molecular genetic evidence indicate that group V is very strongly differentiated from all other groups, thus supporting its current taxonomic treatment as a species, Salmonella bongori, separate from S. enterica. The Salmonella Reference Collection C, composed of the 16 strains used in DNA sequence studies, has been established for research on variation in natural populations.
TI  - Human infection caused by Salmonellae of subspecies II to VI in Germany, 1977-1992.
AB  - Human infections by Salmonella (S.) are usually caused by S. enterica strains belonging to the subspecies I (subsp.). Strains of subsp. II-VI and S. bongori are mostly isolated from animals or environmental specimens, and they are therefore considered as less pathogenic for humans. Out of 90,201 S. isolates examined at the German National Reference Centre for Enteric Pathogens between 1977 to 1992, 89,798 (99.55%) belonged to S. subsp. I, while 403 (0.45%) of strains belonged to S. subsp. II-VI and S. bongori (formerly called subsp. V). 108 strains belonged to subsp. II, 241 isolates to subsp. IIIa and IIIb (formerly called Arizona), 49 to subsp. IV, 4 to S. bongori and one isolate to subsp. VI. 215 of the 403 isolates (53.4%) were from humans, 101 (25.1%) from reptiles, 52 (12.9%) from various warm-blooded animals, 11 (2.7%) from foodstuffs and 12 (3.0%) from environmental specimens. The origin of 12 (3.0%) strains was unknown. According to the clinical diagnosis reported by the laboratories, intestinal disease was associated with 176 (81.9%) out of 215 strains of human origin. 11 (5.1%) strains had been isolated from extraintestinal infections (sepsis, atypical pneumonia, urinary tract and wound infections), and 28 (13.0%) strains from stool specimens of healthy persons. A slightly higher incidence was observed in children of 0-5 years of age (49 cases; 22.8%). Male persons were twice as often affected than females. The seasonal incidence of infections was highest in October and in February. In 53 cases (24.6%), travel to a foreign country was reported.
TI  - Salmonella enterotoxin (stn) gene is prevalent among strains of Salmonella enterica, but not among Salmonella bongori and other Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - All strains and serovars of Salmonella enterica such as serovar Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Dublin, Typhi, etc. were found to carry the Salmonella enterotoxin determinant stn as far as examined in PCR and hybridization studies. However, using MDCK cells for testing the toxicity of the strains under investigation, only a limited number of stn positive strains revealed phenotypically the Salmonella enterotoxin Stn. In contrast to S. enterica, other Enterobacteriaceae including Salmonella bongori were found neither genotypically nor phenotypically Stn toxin positive.
TI  - Supplement 1989 (n. 33) to the Kauffmann-White scheme.
AB  - This supplement reports the characters of 18 new Salmonella serovars recognized in 1989 by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmonella: 11 were assigned to S. enterica subsp. enterica, 3 to subspecies salamae, 1 to subspecies arizonae, 2 to subspecies houtenae and 1 to S. bongori.
TI  - Clonal nature of Salmonella typhi and its genetic relatedness to other salmonellae as shown by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and proposal of Salmonella bongori comb. nov.
AB  - Crude cell extracts of 26 isolates of Salmonella serotype typhi (S. typhi) and 48 other Salmonella isolates representing 28 serotypes and seven DNA hybridization subgroups were analyzed for electrophoretic variants of 24 metabolic enzymes by starch gel electrophoresis. All strains of S. typhi had identical isoenzyme patterns, indicating that they were a single clone. All of the enzymes detected in the remaining strains were polymorphic, and the degree of genetic variation was quite high. The average number of alleles per enzyme locus was 4.7, and the mean genetic diversity per locus was 0.556. Thirty-two distinct allele profiles, or electrophoretic types (ETs), were found in these 48 strains of Salmonella serotypes other than S. typhi. Analysis of the genetic relationships of the ETs to each other showed that, with one exception, the ETs formed subgroups that were consistent with the subgroupings based on DNA hybridization studies. ET profiles were not always linked to specific serologic patterns. These data show that multilocus enzyme electrophoresis has a potential application in epidemiologic and taxonomic studies of salmonellae, although it is not differential for S. typhi. We also propose a new species, Salmonella bongori comb. nov., a new combination base on the elevation of Salmonella choleraesuis subsp. bongori to the level of species.
TI  - Multiple typing of strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. bongori ser. 48:Z35:- isolated in southern Italy.
AB  - In 1984-87, 10 isolates of Salmonella enterica subsp. bongori ser. 48:Z35:-, 9 of human source, were identified at the Southern Italy Centre of Enterobacteriaceae. This serotype had never been identified in Southern Italy before 1984. The combined use of different typing methods, with particular reference to restriction enzyme fingerprinting of plasmid and chromosomal DNA, supports the hypothesis that all Bongor serovars derive from a single strain.
