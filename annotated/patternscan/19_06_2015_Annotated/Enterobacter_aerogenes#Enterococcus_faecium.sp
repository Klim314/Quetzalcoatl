TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == determining the disinfection of textiles in compressed carbon dioxide using various indicator microbes.
AB  == aims: this paper presents a research on the disinfection efficiency of inoculated textile swatches by compressed carbon dioxide, an environmental friendly way to disinfect textiles as opposed to the conventional laundering procedures using water. the disinfection efficiency was determined by using the following microbes inoculated on cotton test fabrics: enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and candida albicans. methods and results: the experiments were performed using the high pressure extraction device with a maximum pressure of 50mpa and a small  extraction vessel of 500ml. pure co(2) and co(2) with added disinfection agent or commercial detergent were used. the chosen disinfecting agent was hydrogen peroxide, a widespread disinfecting chemical. it was found that treatment with co(2) for 25min at 5mpa and 40 degrees c (313k) and the addition of 4ml of specific detergent per litre of co(2) assures at least a five log step reduction  of enterobacter aerogenes and c. albicans, whilst treatment at 50 degrees c (323k) with co(2) for 25min at 5mpa is sufficient for at least a five log step reduction for enterococcus faecium. it was also found that a 15-min co(2) treatment at 7mpa and 20 degrees c (293k) was sufficient for the inactivation of  the yeast c. albicans, whilst these conditions were not rigorous enough for the challenge bacteria. on the other hand, the labscale treatment with co(2) for 25min at pressure 4 and 6mpa with the addition of detergent or hydrogen peroxide  only yields a log step reduction of up to 4 log steps, thus proving the slightly  disinfective properties of the co(2) treatment with added agents, but not reaching efficient results as a 5 log step reduction was not reached. conclusions: addition of heat to the compressed co(2) treatment of textiles inoculated with microorganisms proved more effective than the addition of detergent or disinfectant with compressed co(2) treatment at temperature of 20 degrees c. significance and impact of the study: co(2) treatment of textiles is a promising ecological alternative dry-cleaning method for the disinfection of medical textiles.

TI  == the activity of antimicrobial peptide s-thanatin is independent on multidrug-resistant spectrum of bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the activity of s-thanatin (an analog of antimicrobial peptide derived from thanatin) against different bacterial pathogens frequently which can cause therapeutic problems was tested. the result showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of s-thanatin against all isolates of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella ornithinolytica and klebsiella oxytoca were in the range of 4-16mug/ml, no matter which antibiotic the bacterial was resistant or susceptible, while almost all mics to gram-positive bacterial were >128mug/ml except enterococcus faecium. s-thanatin was more effective toward gram-negative strains, especially for enterobacter and klebsiella. the mics of s-thanatin were no significantly different in the same species regardless of antibiotic sensitive or -resistant isolates to single or multiple antibiotic (p>0.05). likewise, no notable difference could be observed between e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, k. ornithinolytica which were sensitive to s-thanatin (p>0.05). it was implied that the antimicrobial activity of s-thanatin was independent on multi-drug resistance spectrum of bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  == a semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (ep) substrate ethidium  bromide (eb) is described for the assessment of ep systems of bacteria. the method employs the rotor-gene(tm) 3000 thermocycler (corbett research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of eb in phosphate-buffered solution (pbs) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, ph, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (epis). the method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic ep systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of ep-mediated multi-drug resistance (mdr). the method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed ep systems of escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium smegmatis and mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism  can be maintained in pbs, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its ep system.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == significance of infection markers and microbiological findings during tissue processing of cryopreserved arterial homografts for the early postoperative course.
AB  == background: to evaluate homograft implantation for the urgent treatment of vascular infections on the basis of the course of infection using microbiological findings in perioperatively obtained specimens and during homograft processing. patients and methods: 85 patients were treated with cryopreserved homografts from 2004-2007. the microbiological findings of the decontamination process of homografts in the tissue bank were evaluated. the perioperative infection profile (microorganisms, crp, leukocytes, body temperature) of the patients was analysed. results: complete microbiological and clinical follow-up for the postoperative course was available for 35 patients, who were treated with homografts from the same tissue bank and finally included into this study. 55 cryopreserved homografts were implanted. 35/55 (64%) homografts were positive for microorganisms before decontamination. 3/35 (9%) homografts remained positive after the decontamination. 33 patients were operated for prosthetic graft infection and 2 for an infiltration of a large vessel from neighbouring malignant disease. the most common infection agent was staphylococcus aureus. thirty-day mortality was 20% (7/35). only in 4/35 (11%) patients were the microorganisms of  the intraoperative swabs also detected during the postoperative course. the microorganisms were orsa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and burkholderia cepacia. the patient with orsa infection died on pod 11 from multiple organ failure and all other patients recovered. none of the postoperative swabs showed the homograft predecontamination microorganisms. interestingly, a significant association (p = 0.003) between c-reactive protein increase two weeks after surgery and donor-recipient abo mismatch was found. conclusions: the implantation of homografts following the established decontamination is an alternative urgent therapeutic option in vascular infections with encouraging outcomes. the absence of the predecontamination focus in the postoperative specimens of patients, suggests that the postoperative course and outcomes show no strong relation to potential homograft contamination  prior to the decontamination process.

TI  == update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the united states: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) 2005 to 2007.
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (ttest) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.its goal is to assess the in vitro activity  of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. objective: the  aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected  in the united states in 2005, 2006, and 2007. methods: isolates were collected from 172 centers across the united states.in vitro activity was assessed using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines and clsi or us food and drug administration interpretive criteria. results: overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. for the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. one exception was acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for esbl-pproducing escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2%  (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/l against non-esbl-producing k pneumoniae, k oxytoca, e coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and a baumannii. against methicillin susceptible and -resistant s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline mic(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/l. conclusions: this report of 3 years of data from the test study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for a baumannii. tigecycline continued to have good activity against enterobacteriaceae, a baumannii, s aureus, e faecalis, e faecium, and s agalactiae.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  part ii: new insights.
AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  == recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate  laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering  effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the  chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions.  it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.

TI  == intracellular accumulation of linezolid in escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized  that the poor activity of linezolid in gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. methods: using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae. we included test strains with enhanced rnd-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp), an efflux pump inhibitor. results: consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. the accumulation levels in test strains of e. coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin y accumulation. conclusions: the intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps.

TI  == ft-ir microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the potentials and limitations of fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. methods and  results: a total of 1570 ft-ir spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. a classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium at the species level. an average accuracy of about 80% was reached with gram negative bacteria from the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae families; enterobacter aerogenes,  enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp., and citrobacter koseri; and proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. results were comparable with ft-ir measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. conclusions: early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with ft-ir microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is  necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. significance and impact of the study: combination of ft-ir microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.

TI  == analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  == the bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. except g- bacterium, we also found some kinds  of g+ bacterium in infection bile. g- bacterium were not sensitive to clindamycin, g+ bacterium were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. escherichia coli, xanthomonas maltophilia, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ampicillin. g+ bacterium were not sensitive to azactam. enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to ceftazidime. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus coagulase negative, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to ceftriaxone sodium. we didn't found any bacterium resistance imipenem. the possibility of the existence of g+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. the value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.

AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. it is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action  after the product has been applied. we describe here a silver-based disinfectant  technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. methods: a comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. log reduction  of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. in a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was  measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, or salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. results: in the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent  quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against s aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against pseudomonas. no residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. the silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. in addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. conclusions: the findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial  populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

TI  == verifying apple cider plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point programs: choice of indicator bacteria and testing methods.
AB  == the objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the survival of coliforms, escherichia coli, and enterococci in refrigerated apple cider; (ii) to develop simple and inexpensive presumptive methods for detection of these bacteria; (iii) to perform a field survey to determine the prevalence of these bacteria on apples and in apple cider; and (iv) based on our results, to recommend the most useful of these three indicator groups for use in verifying apple cider processing plant sanitation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs. eight of  10 coliform strains (5 e. coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, and 2 klebsiella spp.)  inoculated into preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.4, 13.3(o) brix) survived well at 4 degrees c for 6 days (< or = 3.0 log10 cfu/ml decrease). of 21 enterococci strains (enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. durans), only 2 e. durans and 3 e. faecium strains survived well. simple broth-based colorimetric methods were developed that detected the presence of approximately 10 cells of coliforms or enterococci. in three field studies, samples of unwashed apples (drops and picked), washed apples, and freshly pressed cider were presumptively analyzed for total coliforms, e. coli, and enterococci using qualitative and/or quantitative methods. drop apples were more likely than picked apples to be contaminated with e. coli (26.7% vs. 0%) and enterococci (20% vs. 0%). washing had little effect on coliform populations and in one field study was associated with increased numbers. total coliform populations in cider ranged from < 1 cfu/ml to > 738 most probable number/ml, depending on the enumeration method used and the sample origin. e. coli was not recovered from washed apples or cider, but enterococci were present on 13% of washed apple samples. the qualitative coliform method successfully detected these bacteria on apples and in cider. based on its  exclusively fecal origin, good survival in apple cider, and association with drop apples, we conclude that e. coli is the most useful organism for verifying apple  cider sanitation and haccp programs.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == anaerobic facultative bacteria isolated from the gut of rabbits fed different diets.
AB  == anaerobic facultative bacteria colonizing the intestinal tract of conventional rabbits fed three different diets (standard pellet, hay and pellet/hay mixture) were enumerated in brain heart infusion agar. colony counts recovered from homogenized samples of small intestine, caecum and rectum differed with reference to the diet given. among anaerobic groups, identified from rabbit fed pellet/hay  mixture, enterococci (e. faecalis, e. avium, e. faecium and e. durans) represented the predominant flora. enterobacters (e. cloacae and e. aerogenes) accounted for about 10 to 25% of the bacteria in the rectum and colon respectively, whereas staphylococci (s. intermedius, s. epidermidis and s. lentus) represented 11% of the bacteria isolated from colon.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
