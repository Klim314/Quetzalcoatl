TI  == the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of aeromonas caviae st exhibits nadh-dependent tellurite reductase activity.
AB  == potassium tellurite (k(2)teo(3)) is extremely toxic for most forms of life and only a limited number of organisms are naturally resistant to the toxic effects of this compound. crude extracts prepared from the environmental isolate aeromonas caviae st catalize the in vitro reduction of teo32- in a nadh-dependent reaction. upon fractionation by ionic exchange column chromatography three major  polypeptides identified as the e1, e2, and e3 components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh) complex were identified in fractions exhibiting tellurite-reducing activity. tellurite reductase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities co-eluted from a sephadex gel filtration column. to determine which component(s) of the pdh complex has tellurite reductase activity, the a. caviae st structural genes encoding for e1 (acee), e2 (acef), and e3 (lpda) were independently cloned and expressed in escherichia coli and their gene products purified. results indicated that tellurite reductase activity lies almost exclusively in the e3 component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. the e3 component of the pdh complex from e. coli, zymomonas mobilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and geobacillus stearothermophilus also showed nadh-dependent tellurite reductase in  vitro suggesting that this enzymatic activity is widely distributed among microorganisms.

TI  == construction and characterization of an effector strain of streptococcus mutans for replacement therapy of dental caries.
AB  == an effector strain has been constructed for use in the replacement therapy of dental caries. recombinant dna methods were used to make the streptococcus mutans supercolonizing strain, jh1140, lactate dehydrogenase deficient by deleting virtually all of the ldh open reading frame (orf). to compensate for the resulting metabolic imbalance, a supplemental alcohol dehydrogenase activity was  introduced by substituting the adhb orf from zymomonas mobilis in place of the deleted ldh orf. the resulting clone, bcs3-l1, was found to produce no detectable lactic acid during growth on a variety of carbon sources, and it produced significantly less total acid due to its increased production of ethanol and acetoin. bcs3-l1 was significantly less cariogenic than jh1140 in both gnotobiotic- and conventional-rodent models. it colonized the teeth of conventional rats as well as jh1140 in both aggressive-displacement and preemptive-colonization models. no gross or microscopic abnormalities of major organs were associated with oral colonization of rats with bcs3-l1 for 6 months.  acid-producing revertants of bcs3-l1 were not observed in samples taken from infected animals (reversion frequency, <10(-3)) or by screening cultures grown in vitro, where no revertants were observed among 10(5) colonies examined on ph indicator medium. the reduced pathogenic potential of bcs3-l1, its strong colonization potential, and its genetic stability suggest that this strain is well suited to serve as an effector strain in the replacement therapy of dental caries in humans.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from bacillus sp. v230.
AB  == the beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from bacillus sp. v230 has been cloned in  escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. the product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion  and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. the a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the bacillus subtilis  levanscrase (63.7% identity), the streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).

TI  == genetic and physiological analysis of the lethal effect of l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase deficiency in streptococcus mutans: complementation by alcohol dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == ch4ts is a previously isolated recombinant mutant of streptococcus mutans ng8 which produces a thermolabile l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity. it does not grow at 42 degrees c under a variety of cultivation conditions. in this study, we show that a batch culture of ch4ts shifted from 30 to 42 degrees c underwent rapid cessation of growth and accelerated cell death. the mutant grew at 42 degrees c in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions. under these conditions, lactate production was replaced by production of ethanol and, to a smaller extent, acetoin. the cloned zymomonas mobilis gene for alcohol dehydrogenase ii, placed under the control of the s. mutans spap regulatory signals, complemented ldh deficiency. the alcohol dehydrogenase-complemented mutant grew as well or better than ng8 on a variety of carbon sources at 42 degrees c and produced significant amounts of ethanol in place of lactic acid. these results are in accord with other approaches indicating that s. mutans has other enzymatic activities, including pyruvate formate-lyase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, for pyruvate metabolism. however, at high glucose concentrations,  the levels of activity of these enzymes are apparently insufficient to compensate for the absence of ldh.

TI  == isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrk gene encoding fructokinase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a gene encoding an atp-dependent fructokinase from streptococcus mutans gs-5 was  identified within a 2 kb dna fragment immediately downstream from the scra gene.  the gene cloned in escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. insertional inactivation of this gene in s. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an orf starting 199 bp downstream from the scra gene, preceded  by potential ribosome-binding (shine-dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. this  orf specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated m(r) of 31,681. the deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrk, from s. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from klebsiella  pneumoniae, e. coli plasmid pur400 or vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a  comparable gene from zymomonas mobilis.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == distribution of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system in fermentative bacteria.
AB  == a number of selected fermentative bacteria were surveyed for the presence of the  phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system, with particular attention  to those organisms which ferment glucose by pathways other than the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway. the phosphoenolpyruvate:glusoe phosphotransferase system was found in all homofermentative lactic acid bacteria tested that ferment glucose via the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway, but in none of a group of heterofermentative species of lactobacillus or leuconostoc, which ferment glucose via the phosphoketolase pathway. a phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system was also absent in zymomonas mobilis, which ferments glucose via an anaerobic entner-doudoroff pathway. it thus appears that the phosphotransferase mode of glucose transport is limited to bacteria with the embden-meyerhof-parnas  mode of glucose fermentation.

TI  == energies of activation and uncoupled growth in streptococcus faecalis and zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == growing cultures of streptococcus faecalis at temperatures above 30 c have activation energies for both rates of growth and glycolysis of 10.3 kcal mole(-1), and a constant growth yield; when growth takes place below this temperature, the growth yield decreases and the activation energy for growth increases to 21.1 kcal mole(-1), but the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged. the adenosine triphosphate pool in the organisms behaves differently above and below 30 c, suggesting that the energetic coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective below 30 c. washed suspensions of s. faecalis have repressed glycolytic activity and an activation energy for glycolysis of 15.6 kcal mole(-1) over the whole temperature range studied. growing cultures of  zymomonas mobilis below 33 c have a constant growth yield of 8.3 g (dry weight) of organisms per mole of glucose degraded, and activation energies for both glycolysis and growth of 11.1 kcal mole(-1); above this temperature, the growth yield falls, the activation energy for growth changes to -6.9 kcal mole(-1), but  the activation energy for glycolysis is unchanged, so that the coupling between anabolism and catabolism is less effective above 33 c. the findings support the view that energy turnover in these bacteria is not well regulated.
