TI  - [Antimicrobial sensitivity of hippurate-negative Campylobacter and Helicobacter pullorum strains isolated from patients with diarrhea].
AB  - C. jejuni as well as some hippurate-negative Campylobacter species and related diarrheagenic organisms, are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in our environment all throughout the year. The aim of the present study was to determine the sensitivity of hippurate-negative Campylobacter and Helicobacter pullorum strains isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea. We tested 39 Campylobacter coli, two C. lari and five Helicobacter pullorum strains identified by mass spectrometry analysis. The sensitivity to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erytrhomycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, tigecycline and chloramphenicol was tested by E-test. Most hippurate-negative Campylobacter and H. pullorum isolates studied showed high resistance to tetracycline and to the two fluorquinolones tested. On the other side, all strains were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, tigecycline and chloramphenicol, while most of them were sensitive to both macrolides tested and to gentamicin.
TI  - Prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and enteric Helicobacter in domestic and free living birds in North-Western Italy.
AB  - In order to investigate the prevalence of some thermophilic Campylobacter (C. jejuni and C. coli) and enteric Helicobacter (H. pullorum and H. canadensis) in domestic and wild birds, a total of 278 bird caecal samples were analyzed over a 2 year period in North-Western Italy. Samples were collected from poultry raised in intensive farming at the slaughterhouse (n=102, group A) and in small scale rural farms (n=60, group B) as well as from wild birds (n=116, group C). PCR amplifications were carried out on DNA extracted from caecal samples. Molecular assays targeted the hipO gene for C. jejuni, the asp gene for C. coli and the 16S rRNA gene of H. pullorum/H. canadensis. To differentiate H. pullorum from H. canadensis, PCR products were subjected to an ApaLI digestion assay. Prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter and enteric Helicobacter was significantly different among groups (p<0.0001). Campylobacter infections were detected in all three bird groups (78.4% group A, 18.3% group B and 38.8% group C, respectively), Helicobacter infections were only detected in poultry, with H. pullorum infecting 68.6% of group A and 21.7% of group B birds. H. canadensis was detected in Guinea fowls (group A) and for the first time in pheasants (group B). Mixed infections by enteric Campylobacter and Helicobacter were shown in 53.9% of group A and in 5.0 % of group B. Our results show that both microorganisms commonly infect poultry, especially intensive farming animals. Only hooded crows among the wild bird group (group C), proved to be highly sensitive to Campylobacter infection.
TI  - Characterization of N-linked protein glycosylation in Helicobacter pullorum.
AB  - The first bacterial N-linked glycosylation system was discovered in Campylobacter jejuni, and the key enzyme involved in the coupling of glycan to asparagine residues within the acceptor sequon of the glycoprotein is the oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. Emerging genome sequence data have revealed that pglB orthologues are present in a subset of species from the Deltaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, including three Helicobacter species: H. pullorum, H. canadensis, and H. winghamensis. In contrast to C. jejuni, in which a single pglB gene is located within a larger gene cluster encoding the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan, these Helicobacter species contain two unrelated pglB genes (pglB1 and pglB2), neither of which is located within a larger locus involved in protein glycosylation. In complementation experiments, the H. pullorum PglB1 protein, but not PglB2, was able to transfer C. jejuni N-linked glycan onto an acceptor protein in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the characterized C. jejuni N-glycosylation system with an in vitro oligosaccharyltransferase assay followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry demonstrated the utility of this approach, and when applied to H. pullorum, PglB1-dependent N glycosylation with a linear pentasaccharide was observed. This reaction required an acidic residue at the -2 position of the N-glycosylation sequon, as for C. jejuni. Attempted insertional knockout mutagenesis of the H. pullorum pglB2 gene was unsuccessful, suggesting that it is essential. These first data on N-linked glycosylation in a second bacterial species demonstrate the similarities to, and fundamental differences from, the well-studied C. jejuni system.
TI  - Species-specific identification and differentiation of Arcobacter, Helicobacter and Campylobacter by full-spectral matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis.
AB  - Rapid and reliable identification of Arcobacter and Helicobacter species, and their distinction from phenotypically similar Campylobacter species, has become increasingly important, since many of them are now recognized as human and/or animal pathogens. Matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS has been shown to be a rapid and sensitive method for characterization of micro-organisms. In this study, we therefore established a reference database of selected Arcobacter, Helicobacter and Campylobacter species for MALDI-TOF MS identification. Besides the species with significance as food-borne pathogens - Arcobacter butzleri, Helicobacter pullorum, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli - several other members of these genera were included in the reference library to determine the species specificity of the designed MALDI Biotyper reference database library. Strains that made up the reference database library were grown on Columbia agar, and yielded reproducible and unique mass spectra profiles, which were compared with the Bruker Biotyper database, version 2. The database was used to identify 144 clinical isolates using whole spectral profiles. Furthermore, reproducibility of MALDI-TOF MS results was evaluated with respect to age and/or storage of bacteria and different growth media. It was found that correct identification could be obtained even if the bacteria were stored at room temperature or at 4 degrees C up to 9 days before being tested. In addition, bacteria were correctly identified when grown on Campylosel agar; however, they were not when grown on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar. These results indicate that MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting is a fast and reliable method for the identification of Arcobacter and Helicobacter species, and their distinction from phenotypically similar Campylobacter species, with applications in clinical diagnostics.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of the gyrA gene of Helicobacter pullorum and identification of a point mutation leading to ciprofloxacin resistance in poultry isolates.
AB  - To assess the molecular basis of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance in Helicobacter pullorum, the gyrA gene of H. pullorum CIP 104787T was sequenced. In addition, 9 isolates (2 susceptible to ciprofloxacin and resistant to nalidixic acid, 3 susceptible and 4 resistant to both antibiotics) were selected from 44 poultry isolates and the nucleotide sequences of their quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were compared. The 2490 bp gyrA gene showed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 829 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of gyrA showed>or=72% identity to Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter pylori and Wolinella succinogenes. Moreover, >or=98% amino acid sequence identity was found comparing the QRDR of the H. pullorum type strain with the QRDRs of the aforementioned bacterial species. All ciprofloxacin-resistant poultry isolates showed an ACA-->ATA (Thr-->Ile) substitution at codon 84 of gyrA, corresponding to codons 86, 87 and 83 of Campylobacter jejuni, H. pylori and Escherichia coli gyrA genes, respectively. This substitution was functionally confirmed to be associated with the ciprofloxacin-resistant phenotype of poultry isolates. This is the first report describing the complete 2490 bp nucleotide sequence of H. pullorum gyrA and confirming the involvement of the Thr84Ile substitution of GyrA in ciprofloxacin resistance of H. pullorum.
TI  - Detection and identification of food-borne pathogens of the genera Campylobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter by multiplex PCR in poultry and poultry products.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) to detect and differentiate food-borne pathogens of the three genera Campylobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter in a single step procedure. One common reverse primer and three genus-specific forward primers were designed by hybridizing to the 16S rRNA of selected reference strains. Besides the species with significance as food-borne pathogens isolated from poultry meat--Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Arcobacter butzleri and Helicobacter pullorum--several other members of these genera were tested to determine the specificity of the designed multiplex PCR. In total, 20 ATCC and NCTC reference strains of Campyobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter were used to evaluate the PCR. Specific amplificates were obtained from all thermophilic species of Campylobacter as well as from species of Arcobacter and Helicobacter. No amplification product was obtained from the non-thermophilic Campylobacter, C. hyointestinalis and C. fetus. Furthermore, a total of 43 field strains of the three genera isolated from poultry, pigs, cattle and humans were investigated using this PCR. To confirm the classification of 10 H. pullorum strains the 16S rRNAs were sequenced. The developed PCR is a helpful diagnostic tool to detect and differentiate Campylobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter isolated from poultry and poultry products.
TI  - Identification of campylobacteria isolated from Danish broilers by phenotypic tests and species-specific PCR assays.
AB  - AIMS: To validate a phenotypic Campylobacter species identification method employed to identify campylobacters in broilers by comparison with campylobacterial species identification using various species-specific PCR analyses. METHODS AND RESULTS: From a collection of 2733 phenotypically identified campylobacterial cultures, 108 Campylobacter jejuni cultures and 351 campylobacterial cultures other than Camp. jejuni were subjected to various species-specific PCR assays. On the basis of the genotypic tests, it was demonstrated that Camp. jejuni and Camp. coli constituted approx. 99% of all cultures, while other species identified were Helicobacter pullorum, Camp. lari and Camp. upsaliensis. However, 29% of the 309 Camp. coli cultures identified by phenotypic tests were hippurate-variable or negative Camp. jejuni cultures, whereas some Camp. lari cultures and unspeciated campylobacter cultures belonged to H. pullorum. It was also notable that 2-6% of the cultures were, in fact, mixed cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypic identification scheme employed failed to appropriately differentiate Campylobacter species and particularly to identify the closely related species, H. pullorum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Future phenotypic test schemes should be designed to allow a more accurate differentiation of Campylobacter and related species. Preferably, the phenotypic tests should be supplemented with a genotypic strategy to disclose the true campylobacterial species diversity in broilers.
TI  - Differentiation of clinical Helicobacter pullorum isolates from related Helicobacter and Campylobacter species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pullorum, first detected in the liver and intestinal contents of poultry, was defined as a new species in 1994. This organism has since been isolated from humans with gastroenteritis. Phenotypic as well as genotypic methods have been used to identify H. pullorum associated with cases of human disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical isolates were submitted for identification to the National Laboratory for Enteric Pathogens by Provincial Public Health Laboratories within Canada. Phenotypic characterization was conducted using a variety of growth and biochemical tests including oxidase, catalase, indoxyl acetate, H2S production in triple sugar iron (TSI) agar, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and fatty acid analysis. Genotypic identification was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of a 1-kb fragment of the Helicobacter 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS: During the last 7 years (1993-1999) a total of 11 isolates of H. pullorum were detected from patients with gastroenteritis for inclusion in this study. Typically, these isolates were oxidase and catalase positive, produced optimal growth at 42 degrees C, and produced H2S in TSI. Of these 11 isolates, 1 showed DNase activity, while another did not produce H2S in TSI, and only 2 showed tolerance to 1% bile. Antimicrobial susceptibility assays indicated that 6 of the 11 strains were resistant to nalidixic acid. The fatty acid profiles of the isolates were similar to each other and provided a distinguishing profile from the other related species. Genetically identical and distinct species-specific restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns were produced using the restriction enzymes Bsr I and Dde I. CONCLUSION: Phenotypic and genotypic procedures were used to identify H. pullorum. Interspecies phenotypic variability was apparent and supported the use of a polyphasic approach for identification. Similarities to the more prominent human pathogens Campylobacter coli and C. lari were also noted. The use of a combination of phenotypic and, in particular, genotypic markers for H. pullorum should prove valuable both for epidemiological investigations and for the diagnosis of disease related to this emerging human pathogen.
TI  - Routine identification of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from human  stool samples.
AB  - Correct identification of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates to the species or subspecies level is a cumbersome but nevertheless important task for a routine diagnostic laboratory. The widely used biochemical tests might be often misleading while more sophisticated phenotypic or genotypic methods are not generally available. This investigation was performed to assess the performance of common biochemical identification in comparison with species-specific PCR and gas liquid chromatography of whole cell fatty acid extracts (GLC). A total of 150 consecutive isolates from human stool samples were investigated (134 C. jejuni ssp. jejuni, 14 C. coli, two Helicobacter pullorum). From these 144, 145 and 149 isolates were correctly identified by biochemistry, GLC and PCR, respectively. Biochemical identification of all C. jejuni isolates was confirmed by PCR. GLC detected both H. pullorum strains but misidentified two C. coli strains as C. jejuni and one C. jejuni strain as C. coli. No single method can be defined as 'gold standard' for identification of C. jejuni and C. coli but a combination of techniques is needed. Therefore a stepwise identification scheme starting with biochemical reactions is suggested. All results other than C. jejuni should be confirmed by further methods. For indoxyl acetate-positive isolates species-specific PCR is recommended while GLC seems to be advantageous in indoxyl acetate-negative isolates.
