antimicrobial activities of active component isolated from lawsonia inermis leaves and structure-activity relationships of its analogues against food-borne bacteria.
the antimicrobial activities of lawsonia inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues against food-borne bacteria. the antimicrobial activities of five fractions derived from the methanol extract of lawsonia inermis leaves were evaluated against 7 food-borne bacteria. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was isolated by chromatographic analyses. 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone showed the strong activities against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus epidermidis, and s. intermedius, but exerted no growth-inhibitory activities against s. typhimurium. the antimicrobial activities of the 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues were tested against 7 food-borne bacteria to establish structure-activity relationships. hydroxyl (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), methoxy (2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), and methyl (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) functional groups on the 1,4-naphthoquinone skeleton possessed potent activities, whereas bromo (2-bromo-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dibromo-1,4-naphthoquione) and chloro (2,3-dichloro-1,4-naphthoquinone) exhibited no activity against 7 food-borne bacteria. the l. inermis leaf extract and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone analogues should be useful as natural antimicrobial agents against food-borne bacteria.
a novel synthetic peptide from a tomato defensin exhibits antibacterial activities against helicobacter pylori.
defensins are a class of cysteine-rich proteins, which exert broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this work, we used a bioinformatic approach to identify putative defensins in the tomato genome. fifteen proteins had a mature peptide that includes the well-conserved tetradisulfide array. we selected a representative member of the tomato defensin family; we chemically synthesized its gamma-motif and tested its antimicrobial activity. here, we demonstrate that the synthetic peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus a170, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi, escherichia coli, and helicobacter pylori. in addition, the synthetic peptide shows minimal (<5%) hemolytic activity and absence of cytotoxic effects against thp-1 cells. finally, solyc exerts an anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, as it downregulates the level of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma.
antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of karachi, pakistan.
context: development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. objective: evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. material and methods: nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. results: water extract of syzygium aromaticum l. (myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of ficus carica l. (moraceae) and olea europaea l. (oleaceae) leaves and peganum harmala l. (nitrariaceae) seeds had mic ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. s. aromaticum inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. f. carica and o. europaea inhibited growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. pyogenes whereas p. harmala was effective against s. aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida albicans. ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had mic >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. discussion and conclusion: mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
