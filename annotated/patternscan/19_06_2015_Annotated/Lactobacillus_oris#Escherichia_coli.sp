TI  == [microbiological characteristics in rats given cariogenic diet following the application of fluoride containing toothpastes].
AB  == the paper deals with experimental research work carried out on wistar rats, regarding the effect of fluoride tooth-pastes in varying compounds on microflora  in the oral cavity. the findings show that the most favourable effect on the microbial situation in the cavum oris is exerted by fluoride tooth-pastes prepared on a calcium-free basis.
