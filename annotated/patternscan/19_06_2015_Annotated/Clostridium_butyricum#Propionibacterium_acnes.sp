TI  == enumeration of viable anaerobic bacteria by solid phase cytometry under aerobic conditions.
AB  == classical enumeration methods for anaerobes are time-consuming and require special conditions. solid phase cytometry (spc) is a recent laser scanning technique for the quantitative detection of fluorescently labelled bacteria on a  membrane filter that eliminates the need for a growth phase. fluorescent labelling of cells results from the cleavage by intracellular esterases of a fluorescein type ester to yield a free fluorescein derivative, which is retained  only in cells with an intact cytoplasmic membrane. however, as the standard labelling procedure is carried out under the conditions of aerobiosis, labelling  of anaerobic bacteria does not appear to be obvious. we have labelled eight strains of vegetative anaerobic bacteria (i.e. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium bifermentans, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas canoris, p. gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes) and two strains of spores (c. butyricum, c. perfringens,) within 4 h under aerobic conditions. however, anaerobiosis remained necessary for spores of c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, c. tyrobutyricum. for vegetative cells of all strains, plots of spc versus plate counts were linear with slopes exceeding 1.0, indicating that spc consistently yielded higher numbers of bacteria.

TI  == [numerical taxonomy of gram-positive anaerobic bacilli].
AB  == numerical taxonomy's techniques were employed on twenty one anaerobic gram positive bacilli strains taking account of eighty morphologic and biochemical features. two methods of coding (weighted and non weighted) and four clustering methods (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages; weighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages; single linkage and complete linkage) were used. eight dendrograms were obtained and they showed that c. haemolyticum (strains 1, 2, 4, 7); c. subterminale (strains 8, 19); c. botulinum (strain 14) and c. sporogenes (strain 15) belong to a different group than the other strains. another group would be formed with c. perfringens (strains 3, 5, 6, 12, 16, 21) and c. paraperfringens (strains 9, 10, 11). of the remaining strains the two classified as propionibacterium acnes (strains 17, 18) have a very high degree of agreement. c. histolyticum (strain 20) adjoins at a very low level, while c. butyricum (strain 13) shows a unfixed behaviour. the dendrograms display a disposition according with classical taxonomy.
