TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.
