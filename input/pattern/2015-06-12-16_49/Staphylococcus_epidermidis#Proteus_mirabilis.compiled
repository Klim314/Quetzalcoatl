TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with normal  and altered glycated hemoglobin levels in two regions in Brazil.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with regard to the management of diabetes, assessed using glycated hemoglobin levels. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using conjunctival smears of diabetic patients from both sexes and with different ages, residing in two different Brazilian cities (Sorocaba and Rio Branco). A control group of non-diabetic patients was also included. The diabetic patients were considered to have controlled diabetes when their glycated hemoglobin level was </=7% and blood glucose level was </=126 mg/dL. Patients with non-controlled diabetes were those with glycated hemoglobin levels >7% and blood glucose levels >126 mg/dL. The samples obtained were inoculated in Brain-Heart Infusion broth and in culture media for aerobic bacteria (blood and chocolate agars); bacterial growth was evaluated in a microbiology laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 120 eyes of 120 patients were included in the present study. The percentage of cultures in which bacterial growth was observed was greater in diabetic patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.103). There was a greater trend toward bacterial growth in the conjunctiva of diabetic patients with altered fasting blood glucose. There was no difference in the frequency of bacterial growth on the conjunctiva between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. In Sorocaba, conjunctival bacterial growth was similar to that observed in Rio Branco. The microorganism most frequently detected in the present study was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: There was no difference between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. The microorganisms found were similar to those found in studies investigating the conjunctival bacterial flora of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - [Correlation between urinary stones and urinary tract infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation of urinary stones and urinary tract infections. METHODS: 300 cases with urinary tract stones received in our hospital from Feb. 2010 to Oct. 2013 were chosen as study samples. Urine routine index, situation of urine positivity and urinary tract infection after surgery were analyzed while, intraoperative cotton swabs were tested after being dipped in liquid near stones. Main components of stones in non-infected and infected stone group were analyzed and compared. Data on urolithiasis was collected. RESULTS: 96 infected stones were found in 300 patients, accounting for 32%, which including 35 cases of E. coli (36.5%), 28 cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.2%), and 15 cases of Proteus mirabilis (15.6%). Numbers of urine abnormalities, urine positivities, positive intraoperative cotton swabs and urinary tract infections in patients in the group with infected stones, were significantly higher than in the group without infected stones and the differences were statistically significant (chi(2) = 8.203, 73.99, 178.9, 24.26, P < 0.05). The incidence rates of hexahydrate magnesium ammonium phosphate, carbonate apatite and hydroxyapatite stones in the group with infected stones were significantly higher than those in the non-infected-rock group while the incidence rates of calcium oxalate and uric acid stones were found significantly lower than those in the non-infected-stone group, with differences statistically significant (chi(2) = 167.6, 21.00, 8.586, 73.17, 48.79, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Bacteria could cause urinary tract stones, and infected stones were always associated with urinary tract infections. Bacteria detection in patients with urinary calculi was particularly important to avoid the urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe): a new antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant cyclic dipeptide from Bacillus sp. N strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode.
AB  - A new microbial cyclic dipeptide (diketopiperazine), cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) was isolated for the first time from the ethyl acetate extract of fermented modified nutrient broth of Bacillus sp. N strain associated with rhabditid Entomopathogenic nematode. Antibacterial activity of the compound was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration and agar disc diffusion method against medically important bacteria and the compound recorded significant antibacterial against test bacteria. Highest activity was recorded against Staphylococcus epidermis (1 microg/ml) followed by Proteus mirabilis (2 microg/ml). The activity of cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) against S. epidermis is better than chloramphenicol, the standard antibiotics. Cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) recorded significant antitumor activity against A549 cells (IC50 value: 10 muM) and this compound recorded no cytotoxicity against factor signaling normal fibroblast cells up to 100 muM. Cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) induced significant morphological changes and DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis in A549 cells. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide stained cells indicated apoptosis induction by cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) did not induce cell cycle arrest. Effector molecule of apoptosis such as caspase-3 was found activated in treated cells, suggesting apoptosis as the main mode of cell death. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging and reducing power activity, and the compound recorded significant antioxidant activity. The free radical scavenging activity of cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) is almost equal to that of butylated hydroxyanisole, the standard antioxidant agent. We also compared the biological activity of natural cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) with synthetic cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) and cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Phe). Natural and synthetic cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) recorded similar pattern of activity. Although synthetic cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Phe) recorded lower activity. But in the case of reducing power activity, synthetic cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Phe) recorded significant activity than natural and synthetic cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe). The results of the present study reveals that cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) is more bioactive than cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Phe). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) has been isolated from microbial natural source and also the antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant activity of cyclo(D-Tyr-D-Phe) is also reported for the first time.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Chemical and antimicrobial studies on the essential oil from Salvia santolinifolia Boiss.
AB  - In view of the reputation of genus Salvia in folklore medicine and its abundance  in our region, the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil from S. santolinifolia Boiss. was analyzed. Chemical analysis, using gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, retention indices and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has resulted in identification of 116 constituents, comprising about 97% of the total constituents. Out of these 116, 78 constituents are hitherto unreported from this source. The species belongs to alpha-pinene chemotype. In antibacterial assay, gram negative gastropathogens (Shigella boydii, S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae); causative agent of urinary tract infection (Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris) and pneumonia (Klebsiella pneumoniae) were found sensitive to this essential oil while Corynebacteria species and Staphylococcus epidermidis were significantly inhibited in antibacterial assay against gram positive bacteria. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol was used for determining antimicrobial activity. Thus the essential oil from this species can be utilized as potential chemotherapeutic agent.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of platelets and cases of septic reactions associated with transfusion of contaminated samples.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: For years, platelet transfusion therapy has been playing an important role in controlling patients with hematological and oncological diseases. However, platelet transfusion represents a serious risk for bacterial sepsis. This study aimed to verify the bacterial contamination index in platelet concentrates (PCs) obtained from the Blood Center of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (HEMORGS). METHODS: All 612 samples of PCs from HEMORGS were analyzed in August 2009 and January 2010. We used a qualitative methodology which was modified manually in order to detect bacterial contamination. The patients who received the platelet units with confirmed positive cultures had their medical records analyzed. After the prospective study, a retrospective analysis of the samples of PCs checked by the bacteriological control from HEMORGS since its foundation (2008) until 2010 was made. RESULTS: Four hundred and eighty samples (10 monthly samples of plateletpheresis and 10 of whole blood-derived platelets) were analyzed in order to compare the contamination index for both studies. Of 1092 samples, 15 were found to be contaminated (6 of retrospective analysis and 9 of prospective). In prospective study, isolated microorganisms were nine Staphylococcus epidermidis, but in retrospective two Staphylococcus sp., two glucose non-fermenting gram negative bacilli, one Streptococcus sp. and one Proteus mirabilis. We report 3 feasible cases of bacterial sepsis associated with the transfusion of CPs analyzed by prospective study. CONCLUSION: Bacterial sepsis associated with platelet transfusion is today the most frequent infectious complication of transfusion medicine. Although complex, it is important to recognize transfusion sepsis in patients to reduce morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Incidence and risk factors for infection in oral cancer patients undergoing different treatments protocols.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in cancer treatments have been counterbalanced by a rising number of immunosuppressed patients with a multitude of new risk factors for infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine risk factors, infectious pathogens in blood and oral cavity of oral cancer patients undergoing different treatment procedures. METHODS: The present prospective cohort analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2007 to October 2009. Total 186 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity were analyzed in the study. Based on treatment procedures patients were divided into three groups, group I were under radiotherapy, group II under chemotherapy and group III were of radio chemotherapy together. Clinical isolates from blood and oral cavity were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus. The predominant gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia were isolated from blood of radiotherapy and oral cavity of chemotherapy treated cases respectively. The predominance of gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were observed in blood of chemotherapy, radio chemotherapy cases and oral cavity of radiotherapy, radio chemotherapy treated cases. Our study also revealed the presence of C. albicans fungi as most significant oral cavity pathogens in radiotherapy and radio chemotherapy cases. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative were reported from the blood of all the three groups of patients. Oral mucositis played a significant role in oral cavity infection and make patients more prone to C. albicans infection.
TI  - Report: Studies on antibacterial activity of some traditional medicinal plants used in folk medicine.
AB  - Ethanolic extracts of eight medicinal plants commonly used in folk medicine were  tested for their antibacterial activity against four Gram positive strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and six Gram negative strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis. Salmonella typhi para A, Salmonella typhi para B and Shigella dysenteriae) that were obtained from different pathological laboratories located in Karachi, Pakistan. Disc diffusion method was used to analyze antibacterial activity. Out of eight, five medicinal plants showed antibacterial activity against two or more than two microbial species. The most effective antimicrobial plant found to be Punica granatum followed by Curcuma zedoaria Rosc, Grewia asiatica L and Carissa carandas L, Curcuma caesia Roxb respectively. From these results, it is evident that medicinal plants could be used as a potential source of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin II secreted by the Arctic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudofactin II is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by Pseudomonas fluorescens BD5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. Pseudofactin II is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino acid in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr3. Adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. Adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. In this study the role and applications of pseudofactin II as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. RESULTS: Pseudofactin II lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and two Candida albicans strains. Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of C. albicans by 92-99%. The same concentration of pseudofactin II dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. Pseudofactin II also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of E. faecalis, E. coli, E. hirae and C. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. The highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of S. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of C. albicans growth. CONCLUSION: Pseudofactin II showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. Up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin II. In addition, pseudofactin II dispersed preformed biofilms. Pseudofactin II can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Antibiotic utilization pattern in a general medical ward of a tertiary medical center in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - To assess the pattern of antibiotic utilization and outcome of patients with bacteremia in a General Medical Ward, all positive blood cultures (BC) over a 12-month period from January 1994 to December 1995 were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-two positive BC were recorded in 43 patients (63% males, 37% females; mean age 65.9 +/- 16.6). 72% of the patients received antibiotics before or soon after obtaining the BC, and ceftriaxone was the most frequently-prescribed antibiotic (41.93%), either alone or in combination with other antibiotics. The bacteremia was due to gram-positive cocci in 60.46% of cases, gram-negative rods in 30.23%, and gram-positive rods in 9.30%. Positive BC due to contamination were not included. The most common gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by S. aureus, while the most common gram-negative bacilli were Brucella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella sp. The suspected sources of the bacteremia were respiratory (21.2%), urinary (19.2%), or skin (19.2%). A subsequent change in the antibiotics regimen was done in 69.76% cases after BC results became available with no apparent effect on the outcome. Adding vancomycin and clindamycin was the most frequent change done (19.4% for each equally). Complications developed in 69.76% of patients, with 88.66% of them suffering from sepsis/shock. 69.23% of the patients improved and 30.77% expired; death was related to infection in 87.5% of cases. In conclusion, most bacteremia in the medical ward of the hospital were due to gram-positive cocci, which should be considered in antibiotic selection prior to BC. Risk factors for acquiring Brucellosis should always be obtained.
TI  - Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Bignoniaceae) as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - This study evaluated, in vitro, the antimicrobial activity of the hexane extract  (JCHE), methanol extract (JCME), and chloroform fraction (JCCF) of bark from Jacaranda cuspidifolia Mart. (Family Bignoniaceae), a Brazilian medicinal plant, traditionally used as anti-syphilis and anti-gonorrhea treatment. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion method followed by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. JCHE was not active against the bacteria evaluated. JCME presented antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 16.3 mg/mL, 9.1 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. JCCF was active against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, S. pyogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and N. gonorrhoeae with MIC values of 18.3 mg/mL, 9.3 mg/mL, 6.3 mg/mL, 6.1 mg/mL, 9.2 mg/mL, 6.2 mg/mL, and 25.2 mg/mL, respectively. Phytochemical analysis of JCME and JCCF gave positive results for saponins, coumarins, flavonoids, tannins, quinones, alkaloids, triterpenes, and steroids. Verbascoside was isolated and identified as a major peak in JCME and JCCF high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprints and might contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants against clinical isolates of oral cancer cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppression of immune system in treated cancer patients may lead to secondary infections that obviate the need of antibiotics. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the occurrence of secondary infections in immuno-suppressed patients along with herbal control of these infections with the following objectives to: (a) isolate the microbial species from the treated oral cancer patients along with the estimation of absolute neutrophile counts of patients (b) assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity medicinal plants against the above clinical isolates. METHODS: Blood and oral swab cultures were taken from 40 oral cancer patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D.S. Health University,Rohtak, Haryana. Clinical isolates were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. The medicinal plants selected for antimicrobial activity analysis were Asphodelus tenuifolius Cav., Asparagus racemosus Willd., Balanites aegyptiaca L., Cestrum diurnum L., Cordia dichotoma G. Forst, Eclipta alba L., Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng. , Pedalium murex L., Ricinus communis L. and Trigonella foenum graecum L. The antimicrobial efficacy of medicinal plants was evaluated by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. MIC and MFC were investigated by serial two fold microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23.2%), Escherichia coli (15.62%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.37%), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.81%), Proteus mirabilis (3.6%), Proteus vulgaris (4.2%) and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans (14.6%), Aspergillus fumigatus (9.37%). Out of 40 cases, 35 (87.5%) were observed as neutropenic. Eight medicinal plants (A. tenuifolius, A. racemosus, B. aegyptiaca, E. alba, M. koenigii, P. murex R. communis and T. foenum graecum) showed significant antimicrobial activity (P < .05) against most of the isolates. The MIC and MFC values were ranged from 31 to 500 mug/ml. P. aeruginosa was observed highest susceptible bacteria (46.6%) on the basis of susceptible index. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that treated oral cancer patients were neutropenic and prone to secondary infection of microbes. The medicinal plant can prove as effective antimicrobial agent to check the secondary infections in treated cancer patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.
TI  - Fluoroquinolone-resistant uncomplicated urinary tract infections, Chinese herbal  medicine may provide help.
AB  - We assessed the effects of Chinese herbs on the uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. A total of 56 pre-menopausal women with uncomplicated UTIs caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were included. Urine cultures were carried out. All organisms were proved to be fluoroquinolone-resistant at baseline. The patients were orally administrated Chinese herbal concoction for ten days. Chinese herbal concoction eradicated the primary pathogen in 71.4% of the patients at the 1-week follow-up. Among the 20 patients who had bacteriologic failures in the Day 5 of treatment, 2 developed superinfection. Of the failures in the group, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Providencia rettgeri were implicated in 50.0%, 50.0% and 100.0% of the failures, respectively. The clinical outcomes were also good, with cure or improvement for more than 80% of all subjects. About 14% of the study subjects reported at least one potential adverse event. The adverse events most frequently reported were nausea and diarrhea. All patients tolerated the symptoms. The adverse reactions did not prevail after discontinuation of the medication. Chinese herbal therapy may be an acceptable alternative for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant uropathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C.
AB  - This study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. In experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees C and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. From the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Staphylococcus aureus species. These 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. All contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. In samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. In experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C. Semen with E. coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. This reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (S. epidermidis and S. aureus). In conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees C, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms of hygienic interest in an organized abattoir in Mumbai, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of food-borne illnesses in India is unknown because of  lack of surveillance networks. Monitoring the prevalence of food-borne pathogens and indicators of contamination in primary production at abattoirs is imperative for creating a data bank and for effective control of such pathogens before they enter the food chain. METHODOLOGY: Microorganisms of hygienic interest were screened for their prevalence at Deonar Abattoir, Mumbai. Swab samples from 96 sheep/goat carcass sites were collected and analyzed for Staphylococcus spp., Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Average Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis counts were 3.15 +/- 0.18 and 3.46 +/- 0.17 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium spp. counts were 3.10 +/- 0.08, 3.41 +/- 0.19 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. The Escherichia coli count was 3.54 +/- 0.06 and the Klebsiella aerogenes count was 3.22 +/- 0.22 log10 CFU/cm(2). Counts for Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis were 3.44 +/- 0.14 log10 CFU/cm(2) and 3.71 +/- 0.12 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. S. epidermidis had the highest percentage prevalence at (41.6%), followed by K. aerogenes (31.9%), B. subtilis (28.2%) and P. vulgaris (23.6%). Salmonella spp. were not isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate high prevalence and diversity of micro flora on carcasses in the primary Indian production facility, which might be attributed to either human handling or improper dressing especially during evisceration process. Appropriate training for personal and production hygiene is essential for workers in Indian meat production facilities.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton Agar on Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.

TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - New trends in prosthesis infection in cardiovascular surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult cardiovascular surgery entails, in many cases, the use of some  kind of prosthesis. Among the potential complications, prosthetic device infection is one of the most devastating in incidence, as well as in prognosis and damage to surrounding tissues. RESULTS: The most common bacterial agents in vascular and cardiac prosthetic device infections are Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis among gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The alternative modalities of treatment for prosthetic device infection encompass partial or total explantation of the prosthesis and its replacement with an infection-resistant graft (e.g., homologous tissue, autologous tissue, or synthetic prosthesis bonded with antibiotics).
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ZnII, CdII, and HgII complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - N,N-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  - The biogenous antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine (NCT) converts by disproportionation to N,N-dichlorotaurine (NDCT) at a rate proportional to acidity. This occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. To understand the consequences of NDCT formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. Differently from NCT, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. While the free acid, Cl(2)HNCH(2)CH(2)SO(3)H, was not available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees C (potassium) and 162-164 degrees C (sodium). The sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). The aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than NCT. With regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation), NDCT was, surprisingly, less efficacious than NCT, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at pH < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. Compared on a molar scale, NDCT was more bactericidal than NCT against the gram-negative bacteria E. coli, P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The increase of bactericidal activity at acidic pH was the same as observed with NCT and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. Taken together, NDCT seems not to be suited to substitute NCT as a preparation fit for medical practice.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Enhanced biofilm-production in pathogens isolated from patients with rare metabolic disorders.
AB  - Biofilm-producing bacteria were isolated from the urine of 19 patients with very  rare metabolic disorders including: hyperlactacidaemia (8 cases), sugar intolerance and gammopathy (1 case), cystinuria (2 cases), Parkinson's disease (1 case), lipidaemia (2 cases), hyperaminoaciduria (1 case) and others (4 cases). A total of 34 strains were collected, Gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms were equally distributed among the slime-producing bacteria, with a prevalence of Staphylococcus epidermidis (30%) the most frequent microorganism isolated together with Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis that accounted for 15% of this group of strains. A quantitative assay of the biofilm production revealed that in Gram-positive pathogens it was three times greater than that observed in bacteria collected from patients not affected by metabolic diseases (p = 0.0001). In Gram-negative strains the biofilm synthesis was 2.2 times higher than those detected in the same bacteria isolated in the absence of metabolic disorders (p = 0.0033). The results observed indicate that biofilm production is enhanced in bacteria isolated from the urine of patients with metabolic disorders. It is suggested that unusual metabolites might facilitate pathogen production of biofilm found in the urine of these patients.
TI  - Endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy: Incidence, causative organisms, and  visual acuity outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence, causative organisms, and visual acuity outcomes associated with endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: The medical records were reviewed of all patients who developed acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis (within 6 weeks of surgery) after pars plana vitrectomy at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 2003. RESULTS: During the 20-year study interval, the overall incidence rate of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis was 0.039% (6/15,326). Cultured organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Proteus mirabilus (n = 1), and Staphylococcus epidermidis/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1); one case was culture-negative. Visual acuity after treatment for endophthalmitis ranged from 2/200 to no light perception, with a final vision of light perception or no light perception in four of six (67%) eyes. CONCLUSION: The incidence of endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy is low but the visual acuity outcomes after treatment are generally poor.
TI  - Traditional medicine in Sakarya province (Turkey) and antimicrobial activities of selected species.
AB  - Traditional medicine in North-West of Turkey (Sakarya province) were studied during a 2 months field study by interviewing local informants from several villages. Plant species used to treat infections were tested for antimicrobial activity. Information was collected for 46 plant species from 30 families and for 5 animal species. Twenty four of the plant species were cultivated. Most used families were Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae and the most used plants were Artemisia absinthium, Equisetum telmateia, Lavandula stoechas, Melissa officinalis, Tussilago farfara and Urtica dioica. A total of 139 medicinal uses were obtained. Plants are used mainly for infectious diseases (18%), for neurological and psychological disorders (13.7%), cardiovascular disorders (13%), skin disorders (12.2%) and respiratory disorders (10.1%). Extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231, using microbroth dilution technique according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). This research showed that Arum maculatum, Datura stramonium, Geranium asphodeloides and Equisetum telmateia petroleum ether extracts had MIC values of 39.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml and 39.1 microg/ml, respectively against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Datura stramonium petroleum ether extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli and Trachystemon orientalis ethanol extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial activity of Arum maculatum, Equisetum telmateia, Geranium asphodeloides, Plantago intermedia, Senecio vulgaris and Trachystemon orientalis has been reported here for the first time.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. In all, 45 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. A small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. In the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. In the second group, a disc, which was saturated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. In the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. The silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. There was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. In the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of S. epidermidis in two and Proteus mirabilis in the remaining. Three and four cultures were positive in the second and third group, respectively. Low colonies of four different organisms (Escherichia coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. There was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. Based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Temporomandibular joint involvement in malignant external otitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present 6 patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) that resulted in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement and to discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, and treatment modalities. STUDY DESIGN: All patients diagnosed with MEO between 1994 and 2002 were reviewed for cases in which the TMJ was invaded by the infectious process. Only patients in whom TMJ involvement was documented radiographically and in whom the clinical course was well documented were included in this study. RESULTS: MEO was diagnosed in 42 patients over an 8-year period; TMJ involvement was recorded in 6 patients (14%). The medical history revealed controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in 4 of the 6 patients. All patients reported early ear symptoms, mainly otalgia and otorrhea. Local signs included an ear canal filled with granulation material, edematous overlying skin, and sensitivity to palpation. Cultures taken from the external ear were positive for either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, or Proteus mirabilis. TMJ symptoms developed between 1 and 5 months after admission and included painful periauricular swelling and trismus. In 3 patients, healing was uneventful; 3 also died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: TMJ involvement in MEO is associated with a resistant disease process, often with several recurrences. Prolonged administration of antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Surgical debridement of the TMJ is necessary for the positive identification of the pathogenic organism, in cases of abscess formation, or when osteomyelitic bone destruction of the condyle and glenoid fossa develop.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Bioactivity of secoiridoid glycosides from Centaurium erythraea.
AB  - As part of our on-going search for bioactive compounds from Scottish plants, two  secoiridoid glycosides, swertiamarin and sweroside, have been isolated from the aerial parts of Centaurium erythraea Rafn (Family: Gentianaceae) by reversed-phase preparative HPLC coupled with a photo-diode-array detector. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unambiguously by UV, FABMS and extensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses and also by comparing experimental data with literature data. Antibacterial, free radical scavenging activities and general toxicity of these glycosides have been assessed. Both compounds inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. While swertiamarin was also active against Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, sweroside inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Swertiamarin and sweroside exhibited significant general toxicity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay and the LD50 values were 8.0 microg/ml and 34 microg/ml, respectively, whereas that of the positive control podophyllotoxin, a well known cytotoxic lignan, was 2.79 microg/ml. Chemotaxonomic implications of these compounds in the family Gentianaceae have also been discussed briefly.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - [Long-term Cefadroxil prophylaxis in children with recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose, long-term cefadroxil prophylaxis in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections in children. A prospective, randomized trial in 33 children (32 female, 1 male) aged 2-14 years (mean 8.1+/-2.8) was conducted. Children with recurrent urinary tract infections were commenced to six-month prophylaxis with cefadroxil at the dosage of 12.5-15.0 mg/kg at bedtime administered every night (group I, n=15) or alternate night (group II, n=18). Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated agent (90.9%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (3.0%) and Klebsiella oxytoca (3.0%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (3.0%). Cefadroxil prophylaxis was effective in 80% of patients in group I and in 78% patients in group II. Reinfection occurred in 3/15 (20%) patients in-group I and in 4/18 (22.2%) patients in-group II (odds ratio--1.14; 95% confidence interval--0.16-8.3). The difference of reinfection rate between the groups was not significant (p=0.88). The rate of day- and night-time wetting in both groups before prophylaxis of urinary tract infections was high. It decreased significantly at the end of prophylactic treatment with cefadroxil (from 42.4% to 9.1% and from 39.4% to 6.1% respectively). Mild adverse reaction (nausea) was observed in 1/33 patient. In conclusion our study shows that cefadroxil is an effective, well-tolerated and safe agent in the urinary tract infections prophylaxis. Prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections in children with cefadroxil on alternate night regimen might reduce the cost of the treatment.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) because the effect of CPB on serum drug levels is poorly understood. Current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. Few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. This study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin in CPB surgery. METHODS: This prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent CABG surgery. We compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. RESULTS: Serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the MIC90, for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. The serum levels fell below the MIC90 for Enterobacter, Serratia, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSIONS: Serum cefazolin levels during CPB remained consistently above the MIC for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder. Additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.
TI  - Is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  - There is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. Is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? Seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital day surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. Surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. Of the 731 children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin preparation and on completion of the operation. Staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by Escherichia coli (19%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%), while S. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. The efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. In only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (S. aureus and S. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. Cultures taken at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly S. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). Children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and had passed urine. The wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. Follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the Southampton Wound Assessment Scale. Ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. Our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. Routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. Only 1.5% of postoperative cases will require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Assessment of PEO/PTMO multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane blends as coating materials for urinary catheters: in vitro bacterial adhesion and encrustation behavior.
AB  - The effective long-term use of indwelling urinary catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated infection and encrustation. In this study, the suitability of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based multiblock copolymer/segmented polyurethane (SPU) blends as coating materials for the commercial urinary catheters was assessed by measuring swellability, bacterial adhesion, and encrustation behavior. When exposed to PBS (pH 7.4), the blends absorbed a significant amount of water, which was proportional to the copolymer content. It was demonstrated from bacterial adhesion tests that compared to bare SPU, the blend surfaces could significantly reduce the adhesion of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and S. epidermidis; the number of adherent bacteria correlated with the amount of copolymer additive. indicating that the swellability of the blends affected bacterial adhesion. Of the bacteria studied, the greatest effect of the copolymer additive was observed in S. epidermidis adhesion, in which there was an 85% decrease compared to bare SPU with a small amount of copolymer additive as low as 5% based on a dried blend. By using an artificial bladder model, allowing the catheter to be blocked by encrustation, it was revealed that the blend surfaces could effectively resist encrustation. The duration of patency was extended up to 20 +/- 3.1 h on the blend surface containing 10% of the copolymer additive, whereas the silicone-coated catheter, a control, required the least time for blockage, 7.8 +/- 3.1 h. The superior characteristics of the blends compared to other surfaces might be attributed to their PEO-rich surfaces, produced by the migration of PEO phase in the copolymer chain of the blends in an aqueous environment, and provide promising potential as a coating material on the urinary catheter for long-term catheterization.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [Can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). A microbiological diagnosis can be made by examination of a urine sample, and in Danish family practice the diagnosis of UTI is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. These methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. The aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. No prior instruction in testing procedure was given. As the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the Department of Microbiology, University of Southern Denmark, were used. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. The corresponding figures for urine culture were 95% and 96%. The morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified correctly in terms of their motility. DISCUSSION: The results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus O-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. To reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. This study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% o-phenylphenol. METHODS: The organisms used were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228), and from our clinical collection (Proteus mirabilis CH 14, Klebsiella oxytoca CH 22, Serratia liquefaciens CH 90). MIC and MBC were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. The contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. RESULTS: The results showed that MIC values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. The MBC values were similar or higher than the MIC. The disinfectant solution killed E. coli and C. albicans already after 10 min, but for S. aureus 30 min was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that this solution attained the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - [Experimental study of photodynamic effect on bacterial wound microflora].
AB  - The in vitro study of the influence of photodynamic action (with the use of photosensitizer "Photosens", laser and non-laser irradiation) on the strains of the main representatives purulent wound microflora was carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis cultures have been isolated from wound secretions and identified. The photosensitizer was shown to produce no bactericidal effect by itself. Irradiation with laser and non-laser light sources induced a sharp decrease in the number of viable cells in the cultures under study. The irradiation of the photosensitizer led to its activation, manifested in bactericidal action. The results thus obtained confirm good prospect of using photodynamic therapy for the treatment of purulent wounds.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - Influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  - The available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. Nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. In this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. Bacterial counts were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. A total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. An increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of S. aureus. The largest average growth increase was obtained with E. coli. The largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with S. marcescens. Our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced by humen wet cerumen. In vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of gemifloxacin in experimental models of pyelonephritis and wound infection.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (SB-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of Gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis) and Gram-positive wound infection resulting from Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. Gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. Oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. Around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. In the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (P < 0.01) compared with no treatment. No comparator agent had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. Notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (P < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against E. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were inferior (P < 0.01) against P. mirabilis infection. In the S. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (P < 0.01). Results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (P > 0.05). Gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (P < 0.01). No comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against S. pyogenes or S. aureus infections. These data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of Gram-negative urinary tract infection and Gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - The facilitating effect of cigarette smoke on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the tracheal lumen in rats and the improving influence of supplementary vitamin E on this process.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the direct influence of cigarette smoke on the bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and the effect of supplementary vitamin E on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the trachea of rats that do not have the chronic airway pathology associated with smoking. METHODOLOGY: Thirty male Wistar albino rats, weighing approximately 250 g, were used as experimental animals. A 0.1 mL bacterial suspension containing six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenza, Peptostreptococci spp.), isolated previously from pharynx of rats, were instilled into the trachea of three groups of rat (10 control, 10 cigarette smoke-treated and 10 cigarette smoke- and vitamin E-supplemented rats). The smoke-treated rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 days prior to and after intratracheal instillation. The third group of rats were given vitamin E supplements (100 mg/kg per day). Tracheobronchial lavage samples of all rats were quantitatively cultured after 3 days from the instillation. RESULTS: The colony numbers of isolated bacteria were significantly higher in cigarette smoke-treated rats than in the control group and in the smoke- and vitamin E-supplemented rats (P < 0.05). Only S. aureus and S. epidermidis were isolated from vitamin E-supplemented rats, while instilled all six bacterial species were isolated from the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that smoking impairs the elimination of bacteria or facilitates colonization of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of rats. Supplementary treatment with vitamin E reduces the effect of cigarette smoke; however, some bacteria may be resistant to this action of vitamin E.
TI  - In vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of the external eye. Pure reference strain cultures of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. Serial twofold dilutions of 2% HPMC, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. One hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. After 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. After 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. C. albicans and P. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. P. acnes and P. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. S. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. S. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. The viability of P. aeruginosa in HPMC dilutions needs to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of HPMC may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [Use of pefloxacin in the treatment of patients with purulent wounds of soft tissues].
AB  - Pefloxacin was used in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infection in a dose of 400 mg orally twice a day for 10-12 days. As the monotherapy it was applied to 15 patients. 7 patients with clinical signs of non-clostridial anaerobic infection were treated with pefloxacin in combination with intravenous metronidazole. Pefloxacin was highly efficient in 96 per cent of the cases with extensive posttraumatic purulent wounds with and without bone affection, acute purulent wounds of the soft tissue, purulent wounds of the soft tissues in diabetic patients, trophic or decubitus ulcer. 266 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp, were tested and 75 to 100 per cent of them was shown to be susceptible to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the same time the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The pathogen eradication and eradication with superinfection in the cases treated with pefloxacin amounted to 92 per cent. The drug tolerance was good. No clinically significant adverse events were recorded.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Activities of LL-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  - Human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (HNP-1 to HNP-4) and the alpha-helical peptide LL-37. We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - An infection inhibiting urinary catheter material.
AB  - Catheter associated bacteriuria is a common infection in hospitals and nursing homes. An infection inhibiting catheter material for fabricating urinary catheters is being developed. The material consists of silicone rubber elastomer compounded with chlorhexidene gluconate (CHG) matrix. The antibiotic is released in sustained fashion over at least 4 weeks. A method was established for adding CHG to silicone rubber. To protect the CHG, it is suspended in a water soluble wax that also modulates CHG release from the elastomer. It was found that CHG is randomly dispersed in the elastomer and that the primary release mechanism is by diffusion. The antibacterial activity of the material with a range of 0.1 to 5% CHG by weight was examined using in vitro zone inhibition testing. The new material demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against three pathogens tested (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis.). The release rate of CHG was measured in vitro using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With 5% CHG loading, the antibiotic was released at a steady rate of approximately 8.4 mg/cm2/day for periods extending beyond 4 weeks. This new material for urinary catheters has the potential to provide protection against infection and surface colonization.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151 consecutive CSF bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. Treatment decisions associated with individual CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with CSF specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. Treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial therapy based on the reporting of CSF culture isolates. Thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. Three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from 34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (Candida tropicalis, Proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second CSF specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. Thus, only a single isolate (3%; Staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. In contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; Cryptococcus neoformans, 10; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; Streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). We conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from CSF specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of CSF broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.
TI  - [The photometric determination of the antilysozyme activity of microorganisms].
AB  - The method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of Micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. The new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ALA of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ALA. The elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - This study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. The anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. Then, the sample of ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. Thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. Fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. The cultural rate was 60.9%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus viridans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae. Conversely, only three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. The results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus more accurate.
TI  - A simple artificial urine for the growth of urinary pathogens.
AB  - A simple artificial urine medium (AUM) has been developed which provides conditions similar to that found in human urine. AUM solidified with agar enabled the recovery of a wide range of urease-positive and -negative urinary pathogens. Liquid AUM supported growth at concentrations of up to 10(8) cfu ml-1, as found in normal urine. Reproducible, steady-state growth also occurred over many generations in continuous culture. AUM was capable of forming crystals and encrustations resembling those found in natural urinary tract infections. The medium is a suitable replacement for normal urine for use in a wide range of experiments modelling the growth and attachment of urinary pathogens in the clinical environment.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humours  of patients by different topical application modes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humour. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients undergoing cataract extraction received 0.3% ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin eye drops by two different administration modes with different frequencies and intervals of application. At the beginning of cataract extraction (0.5-3 h after the last drop), 50-100 microliters aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber and immediately stored at -80 degrees C. Antibiotic concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Generally, topical ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded aqueous humour levels higher than topical norfloxacin. The highest concentrations of all tested fluoroquinolones were measured after using an application mode, in which one drop was given every 15 min between 0600 hours and 0800 hours, prior to operation. When applied by this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 0.380 (+/- 0.328) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.033-1.388 micrograms.ml-1), norfloxacin 0.182 (0.118) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.038-0.480 microgram.ml-1) and ofloxacin 0.564 (0.372) microgram.ml-1 (range 0.064-1.455 micrograms.ml-1). These mean concentrations were above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90), concentrations required for inhibition of 90% of pathogen strains in vitro of gram-negative bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the pathogen causing eye infections most frequently, were reached by 67.5% of patients after ofloxacin and by 41% after ciprofloxacin, but never after norfloxacin treatment. CONCLUSION: Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humour concentration. This fluoroquinolone may be an useful ophthalmic agent for topical antibacterial management, but it does not seem to be prophylactically effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomanas aeruginosa.
TI  - [Development of resistance to difuracil (PAP-49) in bacteria and its activity in  combination with other antibacterial drugs].
AB  - Possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or N-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(N'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (PAP-49) in Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. It was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. The most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. During the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (E.coli) or was even somewhat higher (S. aureus and Streptococcus sp.). After that a new increase of the resistance was observed. The most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in Streptococcus sp. and the least marked in Staphylococcus sp. and E.coli. Combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to S.epidermidis, S. pneumonase, E.coli and P.mirabilis. The most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.
TI  - Risk of microbial contamination with multiple use of 5-fluorouracil vials.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. METHODS: Ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-FU were determined for each organism. Organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-FU (50 mg/ml) and, after timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees C. Plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. RESULTS: The MICs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-FU used by some clinics. After incubation in 5-FU for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis-were still viable. CONCLUSION: 5-FU has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-FU vials are used in multiple dose fashion.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - The associated microflora to the larvae of human bot fly Dermatobia hominis L. Jr. (Diptera: Cuterebridae) and its furuncular lesions in cattle.
AB  - The microflora associated to furuncular lesions, larvae and pupae of Dermatobia hominis, as well as the relationships between parasite, host and microflora associated, as a comprehensive microsystem, has been studied. One hundred and two furuncular myiasis due to D. hominis larvae in several breeds of cattle were studied and the following bacterial species were significant: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. warneri, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Closely related, the microflora associated to 141 samples from first, second, third instar larva and both external surface and larval cavities has been studied. The representative associated microflora to the larvae were: S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. hycus and Moraxella phenylpiruvica, Moerella wisconsiensis, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, M. phenylpiruvica, M. wisconsiensis, P. mirabilis and P. rettgeri were the representative microflora associated to 64 pupae of D. hominis.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995.

TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - Variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact DAPI-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  - As current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) are attractive. In this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic acids are used to identify bacterial cells. Bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with SdFFF if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant. The effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. Specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. Specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. Specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. Such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the SdFFF technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. Moreover, they have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.
TI  - Endophthalmitis in patients with retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the treatment and outcomes of patients presenting with concurrent endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients presenting with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification between 1990 and 1994. RESULTS: Five patients were identified with culture-proven endophthalmitis and retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. In all patients, coagulase-negative staphylococci were cultured from the vitreous fluid. One patient also had positive cultures for Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. The interval between cataract surgery and treatment ranged from 5 days to 6 months. Echography was beneficial in showing retained lens fragments in five of five patients when media opacities obscured the view of the fundus. Four patients had vitrectomy and removal of retained lens fragments during their initial treatment. The fifth patient was treated with intravitreal antibiotics alone and continued to have marked inflammation, eventually requiring vitrectomy for removal of the retained lens fragments. A final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in four of the five patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients may present with endophthalmitis in the setting of retained lens fragments after phacoemulsification. In such cases, the preferred initial management may be pars plana vitrectomy, removal of retained lens fragments, and injection of intraocular antibiotics. In eyes with endophthalmitis and opaque media, echography is a useful screening modality.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Evidence that orthotopic transposition following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation corrects overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - An overgrowth of pathogenic organisms occurs following rat heterotopic small bowel transplantation. This study assessed whether the bacterial microflora return to normal following subsequent orthotopic transposition of the graft. After 14 days the heterotopic graft was placed into continuity following resection of 15 cm of the host midintestinal loop. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the intraluminal bacteria were performed studying the resected host intestine, the heterotopic graft at 14 days, and the graft 14 days after transposition. A group of normal rats were used as controls. An overgrowth of Staphylococcus epidermidis evident in the heterotopic graft at 14 days returned to a more normal bacterial profile following orthotopic transposition. These findings suggest that early interposition of a small bowel graft into an orthotopic position may prevent an alteration in the small bowel ecology toward potentially pathogenic organisms capable of translocation.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  - In laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. The absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. In a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. In a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990.

TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. Prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  - Wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. Over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. Seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. Seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. Forty of 63 (64%) infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with Staphylococcus epidermidis (29%), Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (17%), Escherichia coli (11%) and Proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. Only 7 of 42 (17%) noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only S aureus, S epidermidis and Corynebacterium species isolated. Ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. Rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. Emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. Therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.
TI  - Nonpuerperal breast infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We undertook a microbiological study of purulent specimens from women  with symptomatic breast abscesses. METHODS: Fifty-one purulent samples were collected in 2 periods (December 1991-April 1992 and January 1994-June 1994) from nonpuerperal breast abscesses in 44 patients attending our hospital. RESULTS: One of the most frequently isolated microorganisms was Proteus mirabilis (9 patients, 20.4%), present as a pure culture in all but 1 specimen (isolated together with Peptostreptococcus spp.). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 10 specimens, 6 of which were post-tumorectomy abscesses. Polymicrobial anaerobic flora were isolated in 11 specimens (21.5%); Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 (8%); and Streptococcus milleri,Alcaligenes sp., and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 1 specimen each. The 7 remaining samples (13.7%) were negative bacteriological cultures. CONCLUSIONS: We draw attention to the frequent isolation of P. mirabilis in recurrent and torpid breast abscesses in 4 women in whom surgery was necessary in addition to antibiotic treatment.
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - [Experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  - The role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological factor in the development of bladder cancer. The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with UTI at the Kyushu University Hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mM) in a growth medium (pH 7.2) at 37 degrees C. Of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microM NO2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of E. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microM) could be detected. Various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. The effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. The mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees C was assayed by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test (using TA100 or TA98 with S9-mix). The mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing S. marcescens or P. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. Potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an XAD-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 3 for 4 hrs. The potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. The mutagen formation at an optimal pH 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. It was noted that even at a physiological pH 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. The mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 6. Mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. The levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of Bridelia ferruginea (Euphorbiaceae).
AB  - Water and ethanol extracts of Bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. The extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus lactis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella sp. The zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. Sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. The Gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the Gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of a siderophore. 3. The activity of deferoxamine in vitro and its influence on the effect of antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of deferoxamine (DFO) both per se and in combination with the reductant ascorbic acid (AA) was determined against 10 E. coli strains, 5 P. mirabilis strains, and 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci. In terms of interaction, the influence of DFO on the activities of cephalothin and gentamicin was furthermore investigated against the same panel of strains employing a macrobroth dilution technique and killing-curve kinetics. The MICs of cephalothin and gentamicin were lowered for one half of the strains. Moreover, DFO prolonged the generation times of logarithmic growth phase considerably, especially when the reductant AA was present. The interactions between DFO or DFO+AA and subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were established by the application of growth constants, and resulted in synergy for 15 out of 25 strains with cephalothin and 9 out of 25 strains with gentamicin.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - The effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  - The effect of a direct electric current (10 microA) on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was investigated. When the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. The zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. Zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. Bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were similarly affected by the application of a 10 microA electric current. A negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. The results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. This may offer a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase enzyme production in bacteria isolated from women with postpartum endometritis.
AB  - One hundred eighty-four postpartum patients with the diagnosis of endomyometritis underwent intrauterine culturing. Beta-Lactamase production was tested using nitrocephin-impregnated discs in 278 bacterial isolates from patients with postpartum endometritis. beta-Lactamase production was found to be present in 149 of 278 (54%) isolates tested: 0 of 39 Streptococcus faecalis (0%), 22 of 41 Escherichia coli (54%), 66 of 68 Bacteroides bivius (97%), 0 of 13 Proteus mirabilis (0%) and 15 of 42 Staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). Anaerobes, as a group, had the highest rate of beta-lactamase production, 94 of 102 (93%), followed by gram negatives, 34 of 84 (40%), then gram positives, 21 of 91 (23%). However, it was the beta-lactamase produced by the gram-negative bacteria that was most responsive to the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The frequent isolation of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria from patients with postpartum endometritis raises concern about the use of antibiotics not resistant to these enzymes. Therefore, antibiotics combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor may have potential as single-agent therapy in obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - Continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  - Bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. Adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. In E. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. On the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as S. epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - A sequential study of intravenous and oral fleroxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study enrolled patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in  a trial to determine the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with intravenous fleroxacin (first 3 days) followed by oral fleroxacin, for a total course of 7-14 days, both administered at a dosage of 400 mg once a day. We enrolled 68 patients with complicated UTIs or acute pyelonephritis, 32 of whom were evaluable for bacteriologic and clinical efficacy. The pathogens isolated included Escherichia coli, 15; enterococci, 9; miscellaneous, 15. Intravenous fleroxacin was given for a mean of 3.2 days, followed by oral fleroxacin for a mean of 5.3 days. A total of 27 patients were clinically cured (84%), two improved, and three failed. A total of 26 patients were bacteriologically cured (81%), and six failed (19%). The bacteria that were not eradicated included enterococci, 4; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1; and Pseudomonas species, 1. One enterococcal isolate became resistant to fleroxacin. Four patients were bacteremic (E. coli, 3; Proteus mirabilis, 1); the pathogen was eradicated in all cases. Two patients developed urinary enterococcal superinfections. A total of 12 patients experienced 16 adverse reactions remotely, possibly, or probably related to fleroxacin (insomnia, 3; dizziness, 2; miscellaneous, 11). One patient had a grand mal seizure after aspirating gastric contents; the seizure was thought to be only remotely related to the study drug. Fleroxacin was discontinued in two patients because of adverse effects (phlebitis at intravenous access site, 1; anxiety and insomnia, 1). Only minor and asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities were observed. All clinical and laboratory abnormalities resolved with discontinuation of the study drug. Fleroxacin is a safe and effective antibiotic for sequential intravenous and oral treatment of acute pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs. Enterococci may be problematic pathogens, as reported with other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. Of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). The organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. Of the organisms isolated, 77% were Gram positive cocci, 15% Gram negative rods and 8% Candida. No blockage of the stents occurred. All of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. None of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections while the stent remained in place. In vitro experiments demonstrated the ability of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. Clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. The high recovery rate of Gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. The findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with Gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.
TI  - A novel electrical method for the prevention of microbial colonization of intravascular cannulae.
AB  - An electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. The device produced an electrical current (10 microA) in both carbon-impregnated and 'Hydrocath' cannulae. In-vitro models were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. The electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. Effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - Microbial adherence on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces.
AB  - Infection remains a major complication following the use of implanted biomaterials. Often these infections are caused by low-virulence organisms or by a mixture of organisms (polymicrobial). In this study two methods were used to quantitate the bacteria which had adhered to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) samples. The bacteria were eluted from the sample using an ultrasonic cleaner. The number eluted was then counted by colony counts, which determines viable organisms and by particle counting which counts both viable and nonviable organisms. A known adherent strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and a strain of Proteus mirabilis were used. In general the adherence of S. epidermidis was greater than that of Proteus. When the two organisms were used together, there was an alteration in the adherence pattern which generally increased the adherence of Proteus and had no effect or decreased the adherence of S. epidermidis. The use of both quantitation techniques provided important information on the adherence of organisms to PMMA to which gentamicin had been added. It was evident that organisms did adhere to the PMMA plus gentamicin samples but were not viable when eluted. The amount of adherence to PMMA plus gentamicin was similar to that of PMMA alone at 30 min but was markedly decreased at 24 h. There was a considerable dead biofilm mass on the PMMA plus gentamicin samples which might be a significant promoter of late infections by providing a surface attractive to other strains of bacteria.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Comparative in vitro susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to pefloxacin and 14 antibiotics].
AB  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin against 782 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients (July-September 1991) in Wroclaw was compared with that of 14 antibiotics (4 aminoglycosides and 10 beta-lactamase). The most susceptible to pefloxacin were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (96.0%), Klebsiella (94.4%), Proteus mirabilis (93.8%) and Escherichia coli (92.7%). The least susceptible proved to be: nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (46.5%), and among them Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3% weakly sensitive, 0% sensitive strains). It was found that over 80% of Gram-negative rods were susceptible to pefloxacin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The most active against staphylococci were netilmicin (92.6%), pefloxacin (89.4%) and amikacin (82.5%).
TI  - [Role of bacterial metabolism in transformation of non-mutagenic compounds into mutagens. II. Participation of bacteria producing urease in degradation of pesticides--urea derivatives].
AB  - Participation of bacteria producing urease: Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus  epidermidis in degradation of pesticides--urea derivatives, was investigated. Four new compounds were studies: N-/(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl/N'-(2-cyanoethyl)-urea (IPO 6584), N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N'-ethylurea (PO 6236), N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl), N'-propyl-urea (IPO 6237), N-(2-hydroxyethyl), N-methyl-N'-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-urea (IPO 3102), pesticide reference standard--thiram fungicide--tetramethyl-bis-thiocarbamyl disulfide, and rodenticide-alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU). Investigated compounds were incubated with cells of P. mirabilis 4508 ans S. epidermidis CCM 2448 and commercial preparation of urease from beans. Mutagenicity of resulting metabolites was then studies by the Ames test. All compounds were decomposed by bacteria used in this study, as well with beans urease with different activity. Reaction products did not exhibit mutagenic activity for test strains S. typhimurium his- TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - Biofilm and scleral buckle-associated infections. A mechanism for persistence.
AB  - Scleral buckle infections tend to be persistent as well as resistant to antimicrobial treatment. Often, scleral buckle infections require removal of the buckling elements for resolution. To determine if bacteria are able to persist on scleral buckles by elaborating a glycocalyx matrix or biofilm that offers protection against host defenses and antimicrobial treatment, the authors cultured 28 scleral buckle elements removed for infection and extrusion. Bacteria were isolated from 18 elements (64%). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (8), Staphylococcus aureus (3), corynebacteria (3), Mycobacterium chelonei (3), and Proteus mirabilis (3). Eleven (65%) of 17 buckles evaluated with scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria encased in biofilm. Biofilm was demonstrated on the surfaces and ends of solid silicon elements. In the silicon sponges, biofilm also extended into the matrix of the sponges. The authors believe that bacterial production of biofilm offers an explanation for the persistence of scleral buckle infections and their ability to withstand antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.
TI  - Effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis on adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and gentamicin-containing PMMA.
AB  - The goals of this study were to determine 1) effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis adherence and biofilm production on adherence of the opportunistic pathogens Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA); 2) if the biofilm killed by autoclaving altered adherence of other organisms; 3) if adherence of S. epidermidis to gentamicin-containing PMMA altered adherence of the opportunistic pathogens P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa to gentamicin-containing PMMA. Results show that biofilms formed by S. epidermidis, whether alive or dead, significantly increased adherence of Pseudomonas. Adherence of Proteus was significantly increased on dead biofilms and increased, but not significantly (p = less than 0.1), on live ones. Greatest adherence seen in the study was to autoclaved biofilms. Significant adherence of Proteus and Pseudomonas was found on gentamicin-containing PMMA specimens, which were preincubated with S. epidermidis for formation on the biofilm. These results indicate that a biofilm is formed on PMMA-gentamicin specimens and this may impair the ability of gentamicin to kill other organisms.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical PPR: isolation and identification.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic West African dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. From a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. The percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: Staphylococcus 44.0%; Streptococcus 22.67%; Neisseria 12.00%; Pasteurella 10.67%; Pseudomonas 4.00%; Proteus 4.00% and Corynebacterium 1.33%. A further break-down using biochemical tests revealed that Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67% of the total bacteria isolates; Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; Streptococcus viridans 18.67%; Streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; Neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; Proteus mirabilis 2.67%; Proteus rettgeri 1.33%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; Pasteurella multocida 4.00%; Pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and Corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - The effect of protein and urine on uropathogen adhesion to polymer substrata.
AB  - Uropathogenic adhesion was measured using a range of polymer materials with differing surface tension properties. Experiments were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (controls), Tamm Horsfall protein (THP), and human urine with quantitation by image analysis. The results showed that THP did not bind to the polymer materials and therefore did not act as a receptor surface for type 1 fimbriated Escherichia coli. However, the THP did interfere with adhesion by binding directly to these organisms as well as to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and, to a lesser extent, Proteus mirabilis. Incubation of the uropathogens in THP and urine resulted in altered adhesion profiles to polymer surfaces, with no single trend apparent. The results emphasize that fluid components, particularly proteins, and substratum surface tension influence bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to urethral catheters.
AB  - Closed sterile catheter drainage has markedly reduced the incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infections. Infections that occur during closed drainage must ascend by colonizing the catheter or urethra. Our study compared adherence by different bacterial species to different catheter surfaces. We found no bacteria adhering to the hydrophilic catheter surface. Of the gram-negative bacteria Proteus mirabilis showed the greatest adherence to the other catheters and it, like most bacteria, showed the most marked adherence to the red rubber catheter.
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - We treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. Four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. All recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. At the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. The bacterial species isolated were S. epidermidis, group D streptococcus, P. acnes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. All patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. Factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. A single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. Patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of the main opportunistic pathogenic aerobic bacteria].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 1421 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. was studied. Gentamicin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and ristomycin proved to be the antibiotics of choice in treatment of purulent inflammatory diseases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus. For antibiotic therapy of infections caused by gram-negative organisms gentamicin and polymixin might be recommended.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Monoadduct forming photochemical reagents for labeling nucleic acids for hybridization.
AB  - We describe the synthesis of three angelicin derivatives which can be used for labeling nucleic acids with biotin. These compounds were used to label nucleic acids in the presence of lysed cell constituents. The resulting labelled nucleic acids show hybridization to a genus specific probe for E. coli. The relative comparison of sensitivity indicates that a polyamine linker is better than a polyethylene oxide linker between the biotin and angelicin moieties.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of lomefloxacin activity in Colombia.
AB  - As part of the worldwide in vitro program to determine the antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, our study tested susceptibility of bacterial isolates from hospitals in Medellin, Colombia. A total of 504 bacterial isolates were obtained from patients at three different centers. For Enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 micrograms/ml inhibited 100% of the indole-positive Proteus and Salmonella spp.; 1 microgram/ml inhibited 100% of Shigella and Citrobacter, 2 microgram/ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacter spp., E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates tested. The MIC90 for Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. was 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and 2 micrograms/ml for S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus. The MIC90 of Streptococcus spp. were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for all isolates tested. Considering that 97.8% were susceptible to concentrations of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of lomefloxacin, this new quinolone offers potential in the therapy of a variety of systemic infections, especially in patients with multiply resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Evaluation of the treatment with oral ciprofloxacin: experience with 24 patients].
AB  - We have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). Two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. In most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. Only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. Seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. The isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: E. coli (9), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). There were only two gram positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The overall clinical response rate was 91%. Gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. Colonization by Candida or Enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. Four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. Ciprofloxacin appears as an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including severe enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Urease activity of bacteria in urine].
AB  - Urea splitting bacteria are related to the formation of struvite or apatite. We investigated the urease activity of bacteria by two methods; the direct measurement of urease activity of viable bacteria and sonicated bacteria from amounts of ammonia by the indophenol method, and the measurement of urease activity by alkalization of infected urine. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had moderate activity of urease, and Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus epidermidis had the most powerful activity. P. mirabilis caused the strongest alkalization in infected urine.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The frequency of isolating urinary infection germs at a community practice and their sensitivity to various antibiotics].
AB  - Nine hundred and thirty one urine's specimens of patients affected by urinary infection have been studied by pathology practising in different towns in France. The most frequently germs retrieved are: Escherichia coli 76%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, Klebsiella 5%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 2%. Were studied Gram negative rods sensibility to ampicillin (A), cephalosporin 1st generation (C), nalidixic acid (Nal), gentamicin (G), norfloxacin (Norf); Gram positive cocci resistance to oxacillin (Oxa), erythromycin (E), pristinamycin (P), gentamicin (G), norfloxacin (Norf). For E. coli: the resistance was 24% A, 2% C1, 0.1% G, 4% Nal, 0.1% Norf. For Klebsiella: the resistance was respectively 96% A, 12% C1, 10% Nal, 18% G., 4% Norf. For P. mirabilis: 11% A, 3% C1, 0% Nal, 9% G, 0% Norf. E. coli strains cephalo R; Gram negative rods Genta R or quinolone R; staphylocoque oxa R or pristina R have been checked by HIA Begin microbiology laboratory. Discrepancies in results have been analysed. This study enabled the participants to improve their bacteriological technic, antibiogramm's reading, results' interpretation.
TI  - In vitro activity of the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole compared  with that of other chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  - For many years now, the combination trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole (active ingredients of Bactrim) has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, Haemophilus influenza, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Citrobacter. In this comparative study, the antibacterial activity of the combination against 2,229 gram-negative and 1,338 gram-positive strains encountered in domiciliary practice was tested and compared with that of other commonly used antimicrobials. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined in microtitre plates using serial dilutions. With regard to the gram-negative strains, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole, with an MIC90 of less than 2 mg/l for most isolates, was the most active substance apart from norfloxacin. The combination also had a powerful inhibitory effect on gram-positive strains, the MIC90 being between 2 and 4 mg/l for all strains except Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Is pelvic inflammatory disease an indication for treatment with ciprofloxacin?
AB  - This pilot study was carried out on 23 gynaecological patients suffering from salpingitis, salpingitis and pelviperitonitis, Douglas' abscess, and vaginal stump abscess. 21 courses were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The diagnoses had been established mainly by pelviscopy and by clinical gynaecological examinations. The dosage was 2 X 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h for 7.6 (5-11) days. Cervical smears collected before therapy revealed the most common pathogens to be Escherichia coli and staphylococci, followed by Proteus mirabilis and streptococci. Clinically ciprofloxacin produced a complete cure in 16 patients (76%), and a clear improvement in four patients (19%). One patient left hospital before completing the therapy. Laboratory tests did not reveal any pathological findings, and ophthalmological examinations (fundoscopy, visus, colour perception) on 16 patients, before and after treatment, likewise did not show any changes. In one patient, therapy had to be discontinued after three days because of pruritic exanthema and vertigo. A second patient complained of strong pain behind the eyes and headache. In both patients these symptoms disappeared completely on discontinuation of treatment. The study showed clinical efficacy of orally administered ciprofloxacin in pelvic inflammatory disease.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - The in-vitro assessment of a collagen/vicryl (polyglactin) composite film together with candidate suture materials for potential use in urinary tract surgery. III. Adherence of bacteria to the material surface.
AB  - A Collagen/Vicryl (Polyglactin) composite membrane (developed for use in urinary  tract surgery) has been incubated in cultures of radioactively labelled urinary tract pathogens vis Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis for up to 1 h. For comparison, collagen film, Vicryl mesh, and a number of absorbable and non-absorbable sutures were similarly tested. Following incubation, samples were also examined by scanning electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions employed, only minimal adherence of the micro-organisms to the collagen coated Vicryl mesh, its two individual components, as well as Vicryl and nylon sutures was observed. Significantly greater numbers of bacteria, however, adhered to silk and Chromic Catgut. The results suggest that adherence of microorganisms to the prosthesis even in infected urine is unlikely to develop into a microcolony of bacteria. However, it should be emphasised that great care must be exercised when extrapolating from the in-vitro to the in-vivo situation.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Endotoxin provocation of experimental renal cystic disease.
AB  - Germ free rats provide a unique model in which to assess biological response to environment. In 48 germ-free male, Sprague-Dawley rats we examined the consequences of oral exposure to nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a nephrotoxin; to Staphylococcus epidermidis and bacillus species, non-endotoxin-containing bacteria; to Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, endotoxin-containing bacteria; and injected E. coli endotoxin on peripheral leukocyte counts and renal morphology. Morphological changes were evaluated by light microscopy and scored blindly on a 0 to 4+ scale for 15 parameters of renal structure. Means of these renal "pathology scores" correlated with counts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The highest counts and scores were found in rats given NDGA and exposed to endotoxin, either by injection or by oral feeding of endotoxin-containing bacteria. Counts and scores were lower in the absence of endotoxin and with non-endotoxin-containing bacteria, given alone or in combination with either NDGA or endotoxin. Results exclude bacterial colonization and intrarenal accumulation of NDGA as causes of nephropathy. They indicate that endotoxin and NDGA act synergistically to provoke renal damage in the germ free NDGA-fed rat and suggest that leukocytes are involved in the process.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
AB  - The effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. Human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. In contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris against bacterial isolates from clinical specimens.
AB  - Chlorhexidine/EDTA/Tris was more active compared with chlorhexidine against the following species of organisms: Acinetobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Providence species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis, when tested in isosensitest agar. The addition of 20% serum to the medium reduced its effectiveness mainly against Providence species, Proteus species, and Streptococcus faecalis. However, the potential for this solution as a bladder instillation or topical antiseptic should be considered because of its reduced side effects compared with chlorhexidine alone, and its increased general effectiveness against all isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Comparison of cefixime and co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. A double-blind general practice study.
AB  - Five hundred and twenty-eight patients with presumptive acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) were randomly assigned to receive cefixime 400 mg once daily, cefixime 200 mg twice daily or co-trimoxazole 2 tablets twice a day for 10 days; 477 completed at least 5 days of therapy. Of the patients 342 (65%) had positive baseline urine cultures, yielding 353 pathogens. A microbiological response was determined for 280 pathogens (79%), eradication being observed in over 94% of isolates; 153 pathogens (43%) were sensitive to both cefixime and co-trimoxazole and eradication was observed in over 96% of cases. Clinical response correlated well with microbiological response. The incidence of diarrhoea and stool changes was higher (P less than 0.005) in the patients who received cefixime once daily than in the other groups. There was a significantly higher incidence of stool changes with cefixime twice daily than with co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.05), but these did not necessitate discontinuation of therapy. Nausea was commoner with co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.05). The majority of pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and staphylococci. Approximately 24% of E. coli were resistant in vitro to co-trimoxazole (P less than 0.005). Cefixime 200 mg twice daily is an effective and safe alternative to co-trimoxazole in the management of acute uncomplicated UTI.
TI  - Response of bacterial antigen in palmoplantar pustulosis.
AB  - Motilities of leukocytes in response to bacterial antigens or sera were examined  in tissues from patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Accelerated migration towards bacterial antigens was detected in the case of Staphylococcus epidermidis in 9 of 19 patients, to Propionibacterium acnes in 5 of 19, to Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus in 3 of 19, while no acceleration was found in neutrophils from the controls. A significantly accelerated migration of normal lymphocytes in response to both patients' and control sera was nil. Inhibition of migration of guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells mixed with lymphocytes from PPP patients was detected in 12 out of 14 patients with the addition of S. epidermidis antigen and 8 of 14 with the addition of P. acnes antigen, while no such inhibition was detected in all 7 controls. The accelerated migration of neutrophils and inhibition of macrophages may participate in the development of PPP.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies of cefotiam in neonates and premature infants].
AB  - The effect of cefotiam (CTM) on neonates and premature infants was examined in basic and clinical studies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CTM against 190 clinically isolated strains kept by this department were investigated. This drug was found to have a strong antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, although some strains were resistant. The CTM was given to 0-3, 4-7, and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and we studied changes in serum CTM levels over time. Mean serum CTM levels were 62.3 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 16.4 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after the injection, with the half-life of 3.6 hours, for the 0-3 day-old premature infants. They were 38.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 10.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 2.9 hours, for the 0-3 day-old neonates. Those levels were 22.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.9 hours, for the 4-7 day-old neonates, and 51.8 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 1.0 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, with the half-life of 1.1 hours, for the greater than or equal to 8 day-old neonates. The CTM was given to 0-3 and greater than or equal to 8 day-old premature infants and neonates by 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at the dose of 20 mg/kg, and changes in serum CTM levels after the infusion were followed. The 0-3 day-old premature infant (there was only one subject) had a peak serum CTM level of 21.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after the start of the infusion (that is, at the time of its completion), with the level decreased to 8.6 micrograms/ml at 7 hours and the half-life was 5.4 hours. The mean peak serum CTM level in 0-3 day-old neonates were 36.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, which decreased to a mean of 7.0 micrograms/ml at 7 hours; the half-life was 2.3 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of bacteria in the tympanic cavity and the mastoid antrum in chronic otitis media.
AB  - Materials collected from the tympanic cavity before operation and from the mastoid antrum during operation of 58 discharging ears of patients with chronic otitis media were cultured, and the bacteria in these two cavities were compared. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism in the tympanic cavity, and S epidermidis in the mastoid antrum. Anaerobic bacteria were found only in the mastoid antrum of patient with cholesteatoma. In 32 (55 per cent) of the 58 ears examined, bacteria were detected in both the tympanic and mastoid cavities. In 17 ears (53 per cent), the bacterial strains in the two cavities differed. The results indicate the necessity of bacteriologic examination of the mastoid cavity during operation to select antibiotics for postoperative treatment.
TI  - Characterization of a Haemophilus sp. isolated from a rabbit with conjunctivitis.
AB  - A case of conjunctivitis in a rabbit caused by a Haemophilus sp. is described. This was the only organism that was isolated in large numbers from the infected eye. The uninfected eye of the same rabbit contained Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Proteus mirabilis and a Neisseria sp. Effects of infection with live Haemophilus sp. isolated from the subject rabbit was studied in the eyes of rabbits and mice. Swabbing live organisms in the normal rabbit eye produced blepharitis within 48 hours. Signs of blepharitis started to disappear after 10 days without treatment. No reaction was noted in the control eye (swabbed with sterile saline) of the rabbit. Swabbing live organisms or sterile saline in the normal mouse eye failed to produce visible lesions up to 4 weeks. Evidence suggests that the Haemophilus sp. was pathogenic for rabbits but not for mice.
TI  - Self-disinfecting plastics for intravenous catheters and prosthetic inserts.
AB  - A disinfectant (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether: Irgasan, Ciba-Geigy) was incorporated into plastic washers fabricated from ethylvinyl acetate (EVA), polyethylene, polypropylene or TPX. Plastics containing 0.2 and 2% Irgasan gave zones of inhibition on nutrient and blood agar plates seeded with micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis or Candida albicans) even after thorough washing. Exceptionally, C. albicans was inhibited only by 2% Irgasan, and EVA gave good inhibition only against the staphylococci. Similar washers of each plastic were implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of rabbits; before insertion each was washed, had thread woven into it and was surrounded by a plasma clot containing 2 X 10(8) Staph. aureus. All the plastics without Irgasan gave rise to abscesses, none of the plastics impregnated with 2% Irgasan did, though from 2 out of 12 sites small numbers of Staph. aureus were isolated at post mortem. Using either clinical or bacteriological criteria, the results were highly significant (P less than 0.00001 and P less than 0.001 respectively), demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in preventing plastic-associated infection.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - [Clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  - In a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). All the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone or in combination with surgical intervention. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. The 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had MICs between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. The MICs for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the MICs for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. One S. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (MIC 16 mg/l). The tolerability was good. Phlebitis was observed in one case only. Based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - Imipenem is a new broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, which when administered  with cilastatin may be a suitable alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside and either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole as therapy for intraabdominal infections. The clinical and microbiologic results for 164 assessable patients given imipenem/cilastatin for intraabdominal infections are reported. Only three of 416 bacterial strains isolated prior to therapy from intraabdominal infection sites were resistant to imipenem (one of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of Morganella morganii, and one of the Fusobacterium varium). Resistance acquired during treatment was reported in four cases: for three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for one strain of Proteus mirabilis. Of 412 strains susceptible to imipenem prior to therapy, 359 were eradicated during treatment. The frequency of clinical cure or improvement was 91%. Imipenem/cilastatin seems to be a useful alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside with either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics in American hospitals.
AB  - A total of 5,825,243 strains of bacteria were isolated in 242 American hospitals  during a period of twelve years (1971 to 1982). The susceptibility to antibiotics of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp. Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. did not change significantly during this period of time. The susceptibility to tetracycline for E. coli and S. aureus increased. Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed a decrease in susceptibility.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - Aminoglycoside resistance among blood culture isolates.
AB  - A total of 633 blood culture isolates were collected from 1981 to 1982 from seven major Finnish hospitals, including all university central hospitals. Susceptibility of the strains to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and netilmicin was determined by the Sensititre microtiter procedure. Resistance against any of these agents occurred in 1.3 to 6.5% of all strains studied. In the Turku University Central Hospital, an increased number of tobramycin- and gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were found; the frequency of strains resistant to tobramycin was 57% and to gentamicin was 29% versus frequencies of 16 and 18%, respectively, which were observed in the other hospitals. An explanation for this might be a change in the use of aminoglycosides in the Turku University Central Hospital; within 3 years, 1979 to 1981, the consumption of tobramycin and amikacin had increased 330 and 290%, respectively, whereas the use of gentamicin had decreased to 24% of that in the beginning of the period. Resistance against tobramycin was mediated by enzymes APH(2")-AAC(6') and ANT(4').
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activity of azlocillin and carbenicillin against 856 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - Eight hundred and fifty-six strains of more than ten species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp and Acinetobacter spp, were tested by the disc diffusion method against azlocillin and carbenicillin. Azlocillin was found to be superior to carbenicillin against Pseudomonas spp, and more than 90% of the tested strains had minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values well below the serum levels attainable after recommended doses of azlocillin. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Gram-positive cocci, however, azlocillin seemed to have little to offer.
TI  - [Concept of class in relation to first-generation cephalosporins].
AB  - The authors consider differences in answer of the first generation cephalosporins against several strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and suggest a revision of the "class" concept as regards sensitivity response of the above mentioned cephalosporins.
TI  - [Some components of preputial bacterial flora in the ram].
AB  - During the reproductive period the AA have carried on bacteriological researches  in the preputial cavity in eight sardinian rams, without pathological processes, living in eight flocks in the country around Sassari, in order to detect the bacteriological flora. This flora could interfere both with fertility and with conservation of seminal material for artificial insemination. Three withdrawals have been carried on before, during and after the reproduction season. E.coli, P. mirabilis, Staph. epidermidis have been found in the varius examined subjects. The AA stress that the same bacterium which had been isolated in the first withdrawal. Moreover in some subjects the bacteriological flora had increased. The AA stress how these data can be useful in order to control the flock fertility and in order to improve the technology of conservation of seminal material.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  - Since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Alcaligenes faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. Addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. However, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). Ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. Growth in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). Addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. The results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.
TI  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine and the antimicrobial agents gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cefalothin, cefotiam and cefsulodin.
AB  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid and gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, cefotiam or cefsulodin, used against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was determined by measuring the effect of the drugs and combination of drugs on growth of the bacteria in an automated turbidimeter. The combination of drugs was considered to be synergistic when the growth inhibiting effect of the combination was greater than that of the combined action of each of the drugs separately. Deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid together with either gentamicin or cefsulodin showed synergy in 10 out of 10, and 5 out of 6 cultures respectively, whereas deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid with chloramphenicol, cephalothin or cefotiam was synergistic in 6 out of 14, 5 out of 11, and 3 out of 6 cultures. This synergistic effect was much lower when microorganisms were incubated with deferoxamine combined with the various antibiotics but without ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid alone had no synergistic effect. When deferoxamine was saturated with iron, its antibacterial effect was completely abolished.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - Isolation of Clostridium pseudotetanicum from a patient with gas gangrene.
AB  - Clostridium pseudotetanicum was isolated along with Serratia marcescens, Proteus  mirabilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis from a patient suffering from gas gangrene who had been injured in the right leg by a power cultivator. Experimental infection of the hind leg of mice with C. pseudotetanicum and the three kinds of aerobic bacteria did not produce any different macroscopic finding in the infection site, compared with aerobic bacterial injection, except for some enlargement of the involved tissue and some slightly altered histolytic findings. Ampicillin, rifampin, and tinidazole were the most active antimicrobial agents against C. pseudotetanicum.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Bacteremia in a Veterans Administration Medical Center (1961-1981).
AB  - Laboratory data on blood cultures were reviewed for the period 1961-1981. Blood cultures accounted for 18% of all bacterial cultures. Nine percent of all blood cultures were positive for growth, including pathogens and contaminants. Of these, 21% wer contaiminants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common contaminant while Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently occurring pathogens, respectively. Four percent of all positive blood cultures, involving pathogens, had multiple organisms with E. coli the most common. There was no drastic change in the frequency of occurrence of Gram negative or positive isolates over the years, but certain pathogens like Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp. and Group A Streptococci were more common from 1971-81 than 1961-70. One percent of all patients with positive blood cultures had the same organism for two months or longer. Analysis of these longer occurring infections yielded a mean of 15, median of 7 and range of 2-87 months. E. coli was the most common pathogen in these chronic infections, followed by S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively.
TI  - Use of rifampin for the treatment of serious staphylococcal and gram-negative bacillary infections.
AB  - The use of rifampin combined with other antimicrobial agents for the treatment of 40 serious bacterial infections against which other treatment regimens had failed was reviewed. Seven of 17 staphylococcal infections (16 due to Staphylococcus aureus and one due to Staphylococcus epidermidis) were cured, as were 16 of 23 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. In vitro tests of interaction between rifampin and other antibiotics produced variable results. However, eight rifampin-resistant strains (six of S. aureus, one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one of Proteus mirabilis) emerged during combination therapy in seven patients; the drugs involved were rifampin plus vancomycin in three instances, rifampin plus gentamicin in two, rifampin plus colistin in one, and rifampin plus pristinamycin in one. Thus, while rifampin produced a dramatic beneficial effect in some patients with serious bacterial infections, the emergence of resistant strains, even with dual drug therapy, was identified as a potential problem.
TI  - Evidence for a slowing in trimethoprim resistance during 1981--a comparison with  earlier years.
AB  - Two thousand seven hundred bacterial strains, isolated during 1981 from urine specimens both from patients in hospital and general practice, were examined for resistance to trimethoprim. The incidence of such resistance was 13% in the hospital isolates and 5.8% in the general practice strains. High level resistance (MIC greater than 1 mg/ml) was present in 75-90% of the resistant strains. With the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis, almost all the trimethoprim-resistant strains were also resistant to sulphonamide. In 410 strains from sputum specimens the incidence of resistance was 5.4%. Disc testing for the determination of sensitivity of urine isolates is best carried out using a 5 micrograms disc, while for sputum isolates our present experience indicates that a 1.25 micrograms disc is most appropriate. Our results indicate that the rate of increase in the acquisition of resistance to trimethoprim appears to have slowed down compared with the period 1975-1977, and that almost all this resistance is now high level. The introduction of trimethoprim alone for therapeutic use appears to have little if any effect on the incidence of trimethoprim resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - The relationship of disc position to zone-of-inhibition size in the disc-agar diffusion test.
AB  - One hundred sixteen clinical isolates of Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were tested against cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefamandole and piperacillin by disc-agar diffusion. Zones-of-inhibition of discs dropped near the center of the plate were compared with those dropped near the periphery. In 28% of the comparisons the inner and outer zones differed by 2 mm or more. Of those, the inner zone was larger 2.5 times more often than the outer zone. Results suggest that the chances of obtaining a susceptible result are greater when discs are placed near the center as opposed to the periphery of the plate.
TI  - Infections associated with subclavian Uldall catheters.
AB  - During a 12-month period, the use of a subclavian vein Uldall catheter (UC) for hemodialysis or plasmapheresis in 27 patients was studied prospectively. Ten patients had ten UC site infections. Organisms associated with these infections included Staphylococcus epidermidis (five), Staphylococcus aureus (four), Proteus mirabilis (two), and Enterococcus (one). The four S aureus infections occurred 1, 2, 4, and 9 days after UC insertion, whereas the five S epidermidis infections occurred 6, 17, 17, 26, and 97 days after insertion. Five patients had associated bacteremias; in one of these patients, the bacteremia was the major cause of death. The incidence of UC site infection and bacteremia based was higher than the incidence of infection reported with any other type of vascular access for hemodialysis. Further studies are necessary to define whether the UC should be routinely employed for temporary vascular access.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - [Treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal injuries].
AB  - Augmentin, a formulation of amoxycillin trihydrate 250 mg and sodium clavulanate  125 mg per tablet (A-CS) (Augmentin; Beecham), was used in treating 29 episodes of urinary tract infection occurring in 26 patients admitted to the Spinal Unit of the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital, Pretoria. Patients who had a urinary bacterial cell count of more than 105 of the same amoxycillin-resistant organism before and after the oral administration of amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 48 hours, received 2 A-CS 375 mg tablets orally, 3 times a day at the start if a meal for 5 days. The 29 strains of amoxycillin-resistant organisms treated in this study were: Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The bacteriological success rate 24 hours after therapy was 100% and 8 days after therapy 69%, dependent on patient management. In patients on free drainage and managed with condoms a bacteriological success rate of 55,5% was recorded and in patients managed by intermittent catheterization a bacteriological success rate of 75% was recorded. Side-effects were minimal; 1 patient complained of dizziness and no instances of nausea or vomiting were reported. Haematological, renal and hepatic monitoring before and after A-CS-therapy revealed no drug-related toxicity.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Postoperative pseudophakic bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  - Five patients who had postoperative pseudophakic bacterial endophthalmitis were treated with topical, periocular, and systemic antibiotics. Four patients also received intravitreal antibiotics and oral corticosteroids. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Proteus mirabilis. Final visual acuities ranged from 6/7.5 (20/25) to no light perception. Response to treatment and final visual acuity did not appear to be related to retention or removal of the intraocular lens.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteriuria in pregnancy].
AB  - The authors present the results of a bacteriological urine analysis of 1774 pregnant women controlled in the Gynecological Dispensary Pescenica in Zagreb. In 2824 examined urine specimens sterile urinocultures were found in 67.6% and bacteriuria in 32.4%. Significant findings of bacteriuria were recorded in 10.5% and insignificant ones in 21.9% of the specimens. The most common bacteria were E. coli (45.24%), then Staphylococcus albus epidermidis (17.4%), Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus (14.64%), Proteus mirabilis (9.39%), and Enterococcus (5.24%). Urine specimens were taken by the dip slide method. A rather high percentage of significant asymptomatic bacteriurias (10.5%) suggests the early detection and therapy in urinary infections as the best prevention of pyelonephritis gravidarum and gestosis. A routine bacteriological urine analysis in pregnant women should be one of the factors included in prenatal care.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin against 7,312  clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefoxitin and cephalothin was tested against 7,312  clinical isolates of aerobic pathogens. Cefoxitin was found to have a broad spectrum of activity. Among the gram-positive cocci, 99.1% of Staphylococcus aureus, 94.4% of Staphylococcus epidermidis and 98.1% of streptococci group B had a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 microgram/ml or less, while only 4.6% of enterococci were sensitive to this concentration of cefoxitin. Among the gram-negative rods 94.4% of Escherichia coli, 89.3% of Klebsiella spp., 97.3% of Proteus mirabilis, 97.4% of Proteus vulgaris and 79.3% of Proteus morganii were sensitive to 16 microgram/ml of cefoxitin or less. The effect of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was negligible. Cefoxitin was less active than cephalothin against gram-positive cocci, the difference being most pronounced against enterococci. Cephalothin was also found to be more active than cefoxitin against P. mirabilis, while cefoxitin was superior to cephalothin against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., P. vulgaris and P. morganii.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Trimethoprim resistance in Finland after five years' use of plain trimethoprim.
AB  - A total of 1388 urinary bacterial pathogens were tested for resistance to plain trimethoprim after five years' use of this drug for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. Samples were obtained in Turku, Finland, where use of the drug is much greater than in other parts of Finland. Resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l; agar-dilution method) occurred in 20.3% of strains isolated from outpatients and 39.8% of strains isolated from inpatients. Escherichia coli and Micrococcus showed low incidences of resistance (11% and 13% respectively in ouptatients and 23% and 19% respectively in inpatients); Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis occupied an intermediate position; and Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella were resistant in 41-76% of cases. Similar incidences of resistance were observed to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. These findings together with the rare occurrence of side effects and convenient dosage confirm the usefulness of plain trimethoprim for urinary tract infection.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - [Microfloral study of bull seminal fluid stored at low temperatures].
AB  - Hundred twenty three samples of bull semen fluid frozen at 196 degrees C including 83 plastic ampules, 20 granules and 20 plastic straws obtained from the containers of the insemination stations of 10 farms from the Sofia district were investigated. Two hundred twelve strains were isolated and identified as: Escherichia coli--25 strains, Hafnia--16 strains, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Proteus mirabilis--9 strains of each. The remaining Gram-negative genera and species were more rarely encountered. Gram positive bacteria: Micrococcus--19 strains, Staphylococcus aureus--17 strains, Staph. epidermidis--15 strains, Bacillus cereus--15 strains, B. subtilis--12 strains. Other representatives of Gram-positive bacteria were also found but in lower percentages. Least bacteria were observed in semen fluid frozen in plastic straws and most--in plastic ampules which were mainly used until recently for cow insemination. It was established that the same bacteria isolated by other authors from fresh sperm were encountered in semen fluid stored at minus temperatures. The conclusion is made that semen fluid stored at low temperature is contaminated with bacteria. It is only natural that these bacteria are introduced in cow genitals by insemination.
TI  - [Basic and clinical examinations of CS-1170 in pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - 1. CS-1170 was administered for the purpose of prophylaxis during cardiac catheterization in patients with heart disease, and its blood levels were measured. 2. The mean blood level (Moni-Trol I standard) after one intravenous shot of 20 mg/kg was 53.6 mcg/ml in catheterized children aged below 6 and 66.9 mcg/ml in catheterized children aged above 10 at 30 minutes, and 1.95 mcg/ml and 5.2 mcg/ml respectively at 6 hours. 3. The mean half life of the blood level was 1.09 hours in catheterized children aged below 6, 1.37 hours in catheterized children aged above 10, and 0.71 hours in infections children. 4. The urinary excretion seemed satisfactorily high although there was a great variation. 5. The clinical efficacy was 88.9%. 6. The bacteriological efficacy was 100% for E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus and was 0% for Staphylococcus epidermidis. 7. Although GOT and GPT were elevated in one case as a side effect, they rapidly returned to normal after discontinuation of administration.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of Proteus, Pseudomonas pyocyanea and staphyloccoci isolated from scleroma and ozena patients].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 292 strains of Proteus, 60 strains of Ps, aeruginosa, 309 strains of S. aureus and 88 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients with scleroma and ozena was studied. The cultures of Pr. mirabilis were sensitive to aminoglucosides (54.9-96.2 per cent) and Pr. morganii were sensitive to levomycetin (81.5 per cent) and neomycin (92.6 per cnet). Sensitivity of Pr. vulgaris and Pr. morganii was reliably higher (p less than 0.001) than that of Pr. mirabilis. The strains of Pr. morganii were less sensitive to monomycin (P less than 0.001) and streptomycin (p less than 0.01) as compared to the cultures of other Proteus species tested. The strains of Ps. aeruginosa were sensitive only to gentamicin (90 per cent) and neomycin (81.1 per cent). Most of the strains of S. aureus (85.4-100 per cent) were sensitive to oleadomycin, erythromycin, olemorphocycline, tetraolean, oxacillin, methicillin ceporin, lincomycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and gentamicin. Benzylpenicillin (90.8 per cent of the sensitive strains), ampicillin (67.1 per cent), tetracycline (66.7 per cent), levomycetin (68.6 per cent) and streptomycin (38.1 per cent) were less effective. Antibacterial therapy in cases with scleroma and ozena should be directed not only against causative agents of the diseases but also against the microbes developing due to disbacteriosis. Combination of parenteral and local use of the antibiotics in the treatment of chronic clebsiellesis decreased the isolation rate of Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa in the patients.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - A study of skin diseases in dogs and cats. II. Microflora of the normal skin of dogs and cats.
AB  - A study of the microflora of the normal skin was undertaken in 10 dogs and 10 cats. Swabs were taken from the surface of the skin at 7 different sites (Fig. 1). Micrococcus spp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Acinetobacter spp. were found consistently in both species. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 9 dogs and 4 cats, and staphylococcus epidermidis from 7 dogs and 5 cats. Beta-hemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas spp., and Alcaligenes spp. were found sporadically.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the female rat genital tract.
AB  - A study of the genital microflora in virgin female rats of reproductive age has demonstrated that alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella pneumotropica, diphtheroid bacilli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Proteus mirabilis are the predominant genital organisms. The pH of the rat vagina was demonstrated to be near neutrality. It is suggested that the higher pH in the rat vagina as compared to the human vagina may account for some of the differences between human and rat genital microflora.
TI  - [Experience in use of amoxicillin for treatment of acute cystitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Seventeen cases of acute simple cystitis were treated by oral administration of amoxicillin at a daily dose of 1.0 g (250 mg X 4 in a day) for consecutive 7 days, and the following results were obtained. 1. Amoxicillin was remarkably effective in 11 of total 17 cases, effective in 2, slightly effective in 2 and non-effective in 2. 2. In terms of effect against isolated bacteria, amoxicillin was remarkably effective against 6 of 11 strains of E. coli, effective against 2, slightly effective against 2 and non-effective against 1, remarkably effective against 2 of 3 strains of Proteus mirabilis and non-effective against 1, and remarkably effective against one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis. 3. There was no severe side effect specially to be mentioned.
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
