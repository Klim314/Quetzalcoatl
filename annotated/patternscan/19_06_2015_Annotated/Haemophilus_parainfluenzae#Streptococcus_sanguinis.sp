TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s  ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == [infective endocarditis--a review of 21 cases in last 10 years].
AB  == twenty one cases of infective endocarditis in last 10 years were re-evaluated by  duke's criteria. fourteen strains of streptococcus viridans, 4 of enterococcus faecalis, 1 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were isolated from blood culture. as to the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 8 strains of streptococci, imipenem revealed the lowest mic value, following penicillin g, ceftriaxon not equal to ampicillin, vancomycin and gentamicin. one strain of them was penicillin-resistant (0.8 micrograms/ml). serum inhibitory test (sit) and serum bactericidal test (sbt) were undergone for 6 cases. the assay was efficient to determine penicillin-tolerance of causative bacterium. vegetations were observed  in 18 cases of 21 by the echo-cardiography, especially transesophageal echocardiography had better diagnostic sensitivity compared to transthoracic echocardiography. however, it took 12 weeks from the first febrile episode to achieve definite diagnosis. one of reasons to take such a long time to reach diagnosis was that major causative organism was s. sanguis, whose inflammatory reaction to the host was said to be strikingly weak.

TI  == effect of titanium on selected oral bacterial species in vitro.
AB  == titanium granules were tested for their antibacterial effect on strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, haemophilus parainfluenzae, fusobacterium spp. and prevotella intermedia in comparison with amalgam and two of its components, copper and tin. glass beads were used as controls. the number of viable bacteria was estimated in samples exposed to the various materials for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h, respectively, and the viable counts were  related to the baseline value. titanium showed low antibacterial effect on the species tested. copper and amalgam showed an expressed toxicity to all species and differed significantly from titanium and glass particles. gram positive streptococcus spp. and a. naeslundii showed a lower susceptibility to the metals  than the gram negative species. the antibacterial effect of copper and amalgam test particles on s. sanguis and p. intermedia was significantly decreased in the presence of serum. this study showed that some metals have a toxic effect in vitro on oral bacteria, a fact that may play a role in plaque formation when these materials are used for dental restorations. titanium did not have a similar antibacterial effect.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == purification and characterization of an outer membrane protein adhesin from haemophilus parainfluenzae hp-28.
AB  == outer membranes were isolated from haemophilus parainfluenzae hp-28 by a mild extraction method followed by sephadex g-150 gel filtration chromatography. the first peak (pool 1) recovered contained an activity which inhibited adherence of  hp-28 cells to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of pool 1 revealed a dominant protein band of 34 kda. the sds-page-purified 34-kda protein was excised from the gel and used for antibody preparation in rabbits. the antiserum produced was analyzed by immunoblot and was shown to be monospecific for the 34-kda protein. anti-34-kda protein antibody was purified from the rabbit antiserum by protein a-sepharose 6mb affinity chromatography. this antibody was then cross-linked to protein a-sepharose 6mb to construct a second affinity column. the 34-kda proteins were purified from outer membranes by this affinity chromatography. the 34-kda protein was homogeneous, as confirmed by sds-page, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase chromatography analyses. fab and fc fragments of the purified anti-34-kda protein antibodies were prepared by papain  digestion, followed by carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. fab fragments from the anti-34-kda protein antibody and the affinity-purified 34-kda protein both showed significant inhibition of parent h. parainfluenzae hp-28 cell adherence to experimental salivary pellicle and to streptococcus sanguis sa-1.

TI  == utilization of a continuous streptococcal surface to measure interbacterial adherence in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cell-to-cell interactions are essential for the formation of dental plaque. a continuous layer of streptococcus sanguis sa-1 cells fixed to a solid surface has been used to evaluate interactions among this bacterium, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and streptococcus sobrinus. s. sanguis cells were attached to a falcon 3001 tissue culture plates or bovine enamel chips, coated with a biological adhesive. scanning electron microscopy of the chips showed the streptococci as a contiguous surface. radiolabeled bacteria were used to measure  a second-species interbacterial adherence to the streptococcal-coated culture plates. strains of h. parainfluenzae known to coaggregate (strain hp-28) and not  to coaggregate (strains hp-42 and hp-80), in suspension with s. sanguis strain sa-1, were studied for adherence. ten-fold-higher numbers of coaggregating strain hp-28 adhered in vitro to the streptococcal layer than did the non-coaggregating  strains. s. sobrinus strain 6715 did not show appreciable adherence to the s. sanguis surface. saliva did not affect the adherence of coaggregating or non-coaggregating h. parainfluenzae strains to s. sanguis strain sa-1. bovine enamel chips, coated with streptococci, mounted on modified orthodontic appliances and placed in the mouths of three volunteers, facilitated the measurement of interbacterial adherence in vivo of streptomycin-resistant strains of h. parainfluenzae (hp-28r or hp-42r). suspensions of bacteria were placed into the mouth, distributed throughout, and expectorated. after 15 or 120 minutes, the appliance with the chips was removed, the chips sonified, and colony-forming units (cfu) of streptomycin-resistant haemophili determined per chip.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nitrate- and nitrite-reducing bacteria in the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == the microbial composition of samples of gastric juice from eight achlorhydric patients was determined by aerobic and rigorously anaerobic culture techniques. bacteria from 16 genera were commonly isolated, but representatives of only three genera, (streptococci, neisseriae and haemophili) were isolated from every patient. nitrate and nitrite were both reduced by veillonellae, haemophili, staphylococci, corynebacteria, lactobacilli, flavobacteria and fusobacteria, but  the potential rate of nitrate reduction by suspensions of veillonellae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and members of the enterobacteriaceae were up to ten times more rapid than the rate of nitrite reduction. conversely, although all neisseria spp. reduced nitrite only some strains reduced nitrate. streptococci did not reduce nitrate. streptococcus sanguis reduced nitrite when grown with haematin; other streptococci did not reduce nitrite. bacterial nitrate and nitrite reduction were active over the ph range 6-8, similar to the ph range of the achlorhydric stomach. from a knowledge of the composition of the bacterial flora and their potential rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction under prevailing conditions, predictions were made about the tendency of nitrite to accumulate during nitrate reduction. studies of the transient accumulation of nitrite by mixed cultures of h. parainfluenzae and n. subflava were consistent with these predictions. haemophili and veillonellae could be responsible for the accumulation of nitrite in the gastric juice of some patients, whereas streptococci and neisseriae would tend to remove nitrite from the stomach as rapidly as it formed.

TI  == nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. suspensions of veillonella parvula and haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing neisseria subflava or streptococcus sanguis. the maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. this ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. these results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.

TI  == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and  veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.
