TI  == non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  == the magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (nsa) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). children below the 6  months age group bear less risk of acquiring nsa infection. under certain situations, metronidazole combats nsa infections in a better way than other antibacterials. the bacteriology of nsa infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. the species of normal cervix  (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. out of the 22 species of nsa isolated, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidaminococcus fermentans and peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. others were peptococcus niger, gaffkya anaerobia, lactobacillus bulgaricus, actinomyces bovis, bacteroides oralis, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. the weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. the umbrella of antibacterials reduced gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. the facultative anaerobes staph aureus, staph epidermidis, kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  == the maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus prevotii, 3% in ruminococcus albus, 4% in acidaminococcus fermentans, peptococcus niger and megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in peptococcus magnus. the biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt  tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid  identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.

TI  == susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria isolated from animals with ovine foot rot  to 28 antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the agar dilution method was used to determine the inhibitory activities of 28 antimicrobial agents against 35 strains of the genus peptostreptococcus, 4 strains of the species peptococcus niger, 20 strains of the species megasphaera elsdenii, 7 strains from the species acidaminococcus fermentans, 8 strains of the genus clostridium, 11 strains of the genus eubacterium, and 1 strain of the species propionibacterium acidipropionici, all of which were isolated from 125 clinical cases of ovine foot rot between january 1987 and december 1988. the three unreidopenicillins studied proved to be the most active antimicrobial agents, with a high percentage of strains being susceptible at a concentration of 64 micrograms/ml. penicillin g, ampicillin, and the three cephalosporins studied  also had good activity. fosfomycin showed a high degree of activity among the 116 anaerobic bacteria tested.

TI  == the biotin-dependent sodium ion pump glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase from fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum). comparison with the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == membrane preparations of fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein).  the enzyme was solubilized with 2% triton x-100 in 0.5 m nacl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-sepharose. the activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on na+ (km = 3 mm) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria acidaminococcus fermentans and clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent km for na+ (1 mm) and  were not stimulated by phospholipids. in addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium  ion. by incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic  sodium ion pump was reconstituted. the enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kda), beta (33 kda), gamma (19 kda), and delta (16 kda) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). the subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. with an antiserum  directed against the decarboxylase from a. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from peptostreptococcus  asaccharolyticus could be detected on western blots.

TI  == a sodium ion gradient as energy source for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus.
AB  == the determination of enzymatic activities in cell-free extracts of acidaminococcus fermentans and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus led to a refined scheme for the pathway of glutamate fermentation via (r)-2-hydroxyglutarate to acetate and butyrate. from the ratio of these products  the amount of atp generated by substrate level phosphorylation was calculated. growth experiments with the organisms including clostridium symbiosum and clostridium tetanomorphum indicated that a sodium gradient contributed additional energy for growth. the high growth yields found in organisms containing the biotin dependent sodium pump glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase could be reduced by the sodium ionophor monensin. in p. asaccharolyticus energy equivalent up to 0.6 mol  atp per mol of glutaconyl-coa decarboxylated was conserved via the na+ gradient.  the data may explain the growth promoting effects of monensin in cattle.

TI  == [cefotiam passage into the maxillary sinus tissues].
AB  == clinical study was made on cefotiam (ctm) and the following results were obtained. tissue concentrations of ctm were determined 1 hour after intravenous injection (ctm 1 g) in chronic sinusitis and maxillary cyst. concentrations of ctm were 16.53 micrograms/g, 13.26 micrograms/g in mucosa of the maxillary sinus, maxillary cyst, respectively. antibacterial activity of ctm was measured on escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, aerococcus, acidaminococcus fermentans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius; that were isolated from pus of maxillary sinus. the highest mic on them was 3.13 micrograms/ml.
