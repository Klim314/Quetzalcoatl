TI  == co-production of esbl and ampc beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of a. baumannii and a. lwoffii in a tertiary care hospital from northern india.
AB  == background: acinetobacter baumannii is an important cause of health care associated infections which are difficult to control and treat, because of widespread antimicrobial resistance which is possessed by this organism. aims: the aim of the present study was to know the prevalence of esbls and ampc beta-lactamases in clinical isolates of acinetobacter spp. which were cultured from various clinical specimens by using different phenotypic methods. settings and design: study was conducted over a period of one year at the microbiology department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. a total of 100 consecutive, non-duplicate strains of acinetobacter species which were isolated from various clinical samples were included. materials and methods: all the isolates were identified by standard microbiological procedures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by kirby-bauer disc diffusion technique. isolates which showed reduced susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins were tested for esbl production by clsi double disc synergy method and also by using sulbactam as an inhibitory agent. isolates which showed reduced susceptibilities  to cefoxitin were tested for ampc detection by doing ampc disc test. statistical  analysis: spss, version 17 was used to calculate p-value. if the p-value was <0.05, it was considered to be significant. results: out of 100 isolates, 82 were acinetobacter baumannii and 18 were acinetobacter lwoffii. esbl were mentioned in 4% of the acinetobacter isolates and in 77% of the isolates by using clavulanic acid and sulbactam as inhibitory agents respectively. ampc beta-lactamase production was detected in 60% isolates of acinetobacter spp. co-production of both esbl and ampc enzymes were seen in 29% of the acinetobacter strains. conclusion: failure in detecting beta-lactamases contributes to their uncontrolled spread and therapeutic failures. hence, these beta-lactamases should be detected routinely and they should be reported to clinicians in time, so that  inappropriate use of antibiotics can be stopped in time.

TI  == prevalence of metalo- beta-lactamase-producing (mbl) acinetobacter species in a tertiary care hospital.
AB  == background and objectives: acinetobacter causes a wide variety of illness in debilitated and hospitalized patients. carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter is  an emerging problem and is a cause of concern as many nosocomial infections with  acinetobacter are resistant to most other antibiotics. the present study was aimed to study metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) production in acinetobacter species.  materials and methods: during one year prospective study, all isolates of acinetobacter obtained from various clinical samples like respiratory, pus, blood and others were included. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by standard kirby bauer disk diffusion method. metallo beta-lactamase (mbl) detection was done by imipenem-edta combined disk method. results: among 1017 isolates, 964 were a. baumannii, 48 were a. lwoffii and 5 were a. hemolyticus. out of these, majority of the isolates were obtained from respiratory samples, followed by pus. a .baumannii showed high level of resistance to cephalosporins,  cotrimoxazole and piperacillin. a .lwoffii and a. hemolyticus showed lesser resistance to all antibiotics. imipenem resistance was observed in 389 (40.3 %) isolates of a.baumannii and mbl activity was seen in 80.3% of isolates. mbl positive isolates of a. baumannii showed higher resistance as compared to mbl negative isolates. conclusion: this study demonstrated that multidrug resistant strains of acinetobacter are common in tertiary care hospitals. unwarranted and unrestricted usage of antibiotics is associated with emergence of resistance in nosocomial pathogens. regular monitoring and documentation of carbapenem resistant is crucial in developing strategies to control infection due to these bacteria.

TI  == comparison between phenotypic and pcr for detection of oxa-23 type and metallo-beta-lactamases producer acinetobacter spp.
AB  == background: resistance to carbapenems is developing around the world and can cause many problems for treatment of patients. production of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) is one of the main mechanism for this type of resistance. so, detection of mbl-producer microorganisms can prevent the spread of this type of resistance. materials and methods: in this study 94 acinetobacter spp. were investigated. resistance to imipenem was conducted after purification and identification. combination disc (cd) and double disc synergy test (ddst) were performed for phenotypic detection of mbl and the molecular pcr method was done for vim-1, vim-2, imp-1 and oxa-23 genes. results: according to tsi, sim and oxidation-fermentation (of) test and pcr assay 93 acinetobacter baumannii and one strain acinetobacter lwoffii were identified. 85% of them were resistant to imipenem. 34% of them have a positive combination disc test (cd) while double disc synergy test (ddst) was negative for all of them. the vim-1, vim-2 and imp-1 genes were not detected in pcr molecular method, however in 74% of strains with positive results in combination disc, were positive for the oxa-23 gene after pcr test. this study shows that the blaoxa-23 resistance determinant may become an emerging therapeutic problem. discussion: according to the results, it seems that combination disc does not have enough specificity for detection of mbl-producer acinetobacter and using double disc synergy test (ddst) can be more convenient.

TI  == identification of 50 class d beta-lactamases and 65 acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases in acinetobacter spp.
AB  == whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 103 acinetobacter strains belonging to 22 validly named species and another 16 putative species allowed detection of genes for 50 new class d beta-lactamases and 65 new acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases (adc). all oxacillinases (oxa) contained the three typical motifs of class d beta-lactamases, stfk, (f/y)gn, and k(s/t)g. the phylogenetic tree drawn from the oxa sequences led to an increase in the number of oxa groups  from 7 to 18. the topologies of the oxa and rpob phylogenetic trees were similar, supporting the ancient acquisition of blaoxa genes by acinetobacter species. the  class d beta-lactamase genes appeared to be intrinsic to several species, such as acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter pittii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and acinetobacter lwoffii. neither blaoxa-40/143- nor blaoxa-58-like genes were detected, and their origin remains therefore unknown. the phylogenetic tree analysis based on the alignment of the sequences deduced from blaadc revealed five main clusters, one containing adc belonging to species closely related to a. baumannii and the others composed of cephalosporinases from the remaining species. no indication of blaoxa or blaadc transfer was observed between distantly related species, except for blaoxa-279, possibly transferred from acinetobacter genomic species 6 to acinetobacter parvus. analysis of beta-lactam  susceptibility of seven strains harboring new oxacillinases and cloning of the corresponding genes in escherichia coli and in a susceptible a. baumannii strain  indicated very weak hydrolysis of carbapenems. overall, this study reveals a large pool of beta-lactamases in different acinetobacter spp., potentially transferable to pathogenic strains of the genus.

TI  == gene-silencing antisense oligomers inhibit acinetobacter growth in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == background: peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (ppmos) are synthetic dna/rna analogues that silence expression of specific genes. we studied whether ppmos targeted to essential genes in acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii are active in vitro and in vivo. methods: ppmos were evaluated in vitro using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and viability assays, and in vivo using murine pulmonary infection models with intranasal ppmo  treatment. results: mics of ppmos ranged from 0.1 to 64 microm (approximately 0.6-38 microg/ml). the most effective ppmo tested was (rxr)4-acpp, which is targeted to acpp. (rxr)4-acpp reduced viability of a. lwoffii and a. baumannii by >10(3) colony-forming units/ml at 5-8 times mic. mice treated with >/=0.25 mg/kg  of (rxr)4-acpp survived longer and had less inflammation and bacterial lung burden than mice treated with a scrambled-sequence ppmo or phosphate-buffered saline. treatment could be delayed after infection and still increase survival. conclusions: ppmos targeted to essential genes of a. lwoffii and a. baumannii were bactericidal and had mics in a clinically relevant range. (rxr)4-acpp increased survival of mice infected with a. lwoffii or a. baumannii, even when initial treatment was delayed after infection. ppmos could be a viable therapeutic approach in dealing with multidrug-resistant acinetobacter species.

TI  == complete genome analysis of three acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates in china for insight into the diversification of drug resistance elements.
AB  == background: the emergence and rapid spreading of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii strains has become a major health threat worldwide. to better understand the genetic recombination related with the acquisition of drug-resistant elements during bacterial infection, we performed complete genome  analysis on three newly isolated multidrug-resistant a. baumannii strains from beijing using next-generation sequencing technology. methodologies/principal findings: whole genome comparison revealed that all 3 strains share some common drug resistant elements including carbapenem-resistant bla oxa-23 and tetracycline (tet) resistance islands, but the genome structures are diversified  among strains. various genomic islands intersperse on the genome with transposons and insertions, reflecting the recombination flexibility during the acquisition of the resistant elements. the blood-isolated bjab07104 and ascites-isolated bjab0868 exhibit high similarity on their genome structure with most of the global clone ii strains, suggesting these two strains belong to the dominant outbreak strains prevalent worldwide. a large resistance island (ri) of about 121-kb, carrying a cluster of resistance-related genes, was inserted into the atpase gene on bjab07104 and bjab0868 genomes. a 78-kb insertion element carrying tra-locus and bla oxa-23 island, can be either inserted into one of the tnib gene in the 121-kb ri on the chromosome, or transformed to conjugative plasmid in the  two bjab strains. the third strains of this study, bjab0715, which was isolated from spinal fluid, exhibit much more divergence compared with above two strains.  it harbors multiple drug-resistance elements including a truncated abar-22-like ri on its genome. one of the unique features of this strain is that it carries both bla oxa-23 and bla oxa-58 genes on its genome. besides, an acinetobacter lwoffii adeabc efflux element was found inserted into the atpase position in bjab0715. conclusions: our comparative analysis on currently completed acinetobacter baumannii genomes revealed extensive and dynamic genome organizations, which may facilitate the bacteria to acquire drug-resistance elements into their genomes.

TI  == epidemiology of bacteremia caused by uncommon non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: prevalence of bacteremia caused by non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria (nfgnb) has been increasing over the past decade. although many studies  have already investigated epidemiology of nfgnb bacteremia, most focused only on  common nfgnb including pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (ab). knowledge of uncommon nfgnb bacteremia is very limited. our study aimed to  investigate epidemiology and identify factors associated with uncommon nfgnb bacteremia. methods: this observational study was conducted at a university hospital in thailand during july 1, 2007-dec 31, 2008. all patients who had at least one blood culture positive for nfgnb and met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome within 24 hours before/after obtaining the blood culture were enrolled. the nfgnb isolates that could not be satisfactorily identified by the standard biochemical assays were further characterized by molecular sequencing methods. to identify factors associated with uncommon nfgnb  bacteremia, characteristics of patients in the uncommon nfgnb group were subsequently compared to patients in the common nfgnb group (ab and pa bacteremia). results: our study detected 223 clinical isolates of nfgnb in 221 unique patients. the major causative pathogens were ab (32.7%), followed by pa (27.8%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (5.4%), acinetobacter lwoffii (4.9%) and burkholderia pseudomallei (2.7%). infection-related mortality was 63.0% in the ab group, 40.3% in the pa group and 17.4% in the uncommon nfgnb group. factors associated with uncommon nfgnb bacteremia (or [95% ci]; p-value) were male sex (0.28 [0.14-0.53]; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired infection (0.23 [0.11-0.51]; p < 0.001), recent aminoglycosides exposure 0.23 [0.06-0.8]; p = 0.01), primary bacteremia (6.43 [2.89-14.2]; p < 0.001]), catheter related infection (4.48 [1.54-13.06]; p < 0.001) and recent vancomycin exposure (3.88 [1.35-11.1]; p = 0.02). conclusions: our distribution of causative pathogens was slightly different from other studies. the common nfgnb group had a remarkably higher id-mortality than the uncommon nfgnb group. knowledge of factors associated with  uncommon nfgnb bacteremia would help physicians to distinguish between low vs. high risk patients.

TI  == emerging threat of multidrug resistant bugs--acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (mdr) acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) constitute a worldwide pandemic. without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. methods: this study was conducted to identify the status of mdr acinetobacter spp. and mrsa in a tertiary care centre of nepal. sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following  standard microbiological methods recommended by the american society for microbiology (asm). double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in acinetobacter isolates. methicillin resistance in s. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. results: different genomespecies of acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and a. lwoffii.  around 95% of acinetobacter isolates were mdr, while 12.9% were esbl-producer. of the total 33 isolates of s. aureus, 26 (78.8%) were mdr and 14 (42.4%) were methicillin resistant. conclusions: a large number of mdr acinetobacter spp. and  mrsa has been noted in this study. the condition is worsened by the emergence of  esbl producing acinetobacter spp. hence, judicious use of antimicrobials is mandatory in clinical settings. moreover, there should be vigilant surveillance of resistant clones in laboratories.

TI  == bla(imp) and bla(vim) mediated carbapenem resistance in pseudomonas and acinetobacter species in india.
AB  == introduction: the emergence and rapid spread of blaimp and blavim metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) producing gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial  infections are of concern worldwide due to limited treatment options. methodology: a total of 179 nonreplicate, consecutive, carbapenem resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (61), acinetobacter baumannii (116), acinetobacter lwoffii (1) and pseudomonas stutzeri (1) isolated from patients hospitalized for 48 hours or more were included in the study. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) to imipenem and meropenem were determined and interpreted according to clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines. the modified hodge test (mht) and inhibitor potentiated disk diffusion tests with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) were used for screening of carbapenamases and mbl production respectively. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed for the detection of mbl (blavim and blaimp) genes. gene sequencing was performed for representative isolates. results: mht was positive in 94.4% (n = 169). mbl screening with edta was positive in 80.4% (n = 144). mbl genes bla vim and bla imp were detected in 92 (51.4%) isolates. bla vim alone was detected in 89 isolates while two isolates had bla imp alone. one isolate had both bla vim and bla imp. among the p. aeruginosa, 36 carried the mbl gene. in a. baumannii, 54 carried the mbl gene. bla vim was found in p. stutzeri and a. lwoffii isolates. conclusion: carbapenem  resistance in p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii is chiefly mediated by mbl production. the common mbl gene is the blavim.

TI  == comparison of the virulence potential of acinetobacter strains from clinical and  environmental sources.
AB  == several acinetobacter strains have utility for biotechnology applications, yet some are opportunistic pathogens. we compared strains of seven acinetobacter species (baumannii, ab; calcoaceticus, ac; guillouiae, ag; haemolyticus, ah; lwoffii, al; junii, aj; and venetianus, av-rag-1) for their potential virulence attributes, including proliferation in mammalian cell conditions, haemolytic/cytolytic activity, ability to elicit inflammatory signals, and antibiotic susceptibility. only ah grew at 10(2) and 10(4) bacteria/well in mammalian cell culture medium at 37 degrees c. however, co-culture with colonic epithelial cells (ht29) improved growth of all bacterial strains, except av-rag-1. cytotoxicity of ab and ah toward ht29 was at least double that of other test bacteria. these effects included bacterial adherence, loss of metabolism, substrate detachment, and cytolysis. only ab and ah exhibited resistance to killing by macrophage-like j774a.1 cells. haemolytic activity of ah and av-rag-1  was strong, but undetectable for other strains. when killed with an antibiotic, ab, ah, aj and av-rag-1 induced 3 to 9-fold elevated ht29 interleukin (il)-8 levels. however, none of the strains altered levels of j774a.1 pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta, il-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). antibiotic susceptibility profiling showed that ab, ag and aj were viable at low concentrations of some antibiotics. all strains were positive for virulence factor genes ompa and epsa, and negative for mutations in gyra and parc genes that convey fluoroquinolone resistance. the data demonstrate that av-rag-1, ag and al lack some potentially harmful characteristics compared to other acinetobacter strains tested, but the biotechnology candidate av-rag-1 should be  scrutinized further prior to widespread use.

TI  == antibacterial effects on acinetobacter species of commonly employed antineoplastic agents used in the treatment of haematological malignancies: an in vitro laboratory evaluation.
AB  == although about 75-80% of neutropenic fevers are thought to be caused by infections, a causal organism can be confirmed microbiologically or suspected clinically in only 30-50%, and even fewer of these cases (16%) have a documented  bacteraemia. the cause of neutropenic fever in the remaining cases remains elusive. the reasons for this failure may be due to the difficulty in recovering  low numbers of organisms, fastidious organisms which fail to grow using conventional culture media, the presence of non-culturable organisms, or the presence of inhibitory substances in specimens. previously, the authors showed the presence of acinetobacter in peripheral blood of febrile neutropenic patients with a haematological malignancy, using 16s rdna polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  and sequencing techniques. however, conventional culture was unable to detect these organisms. hence, it was felt necessary to examine the antibacterial properties of four antineoplastic agents used in the treatment of haematological  malignancy, namely bleomycin, cisplatin, doxorubicin and vincristine. a total of  56 wild-type acinetobacter including seven species (a. calcoaceticus [n=17], a. septicus [n=11], a. baumannii [n=10], a. johnsonii [n=7], a. lwoffii [n=8] a. haemolyticus [n=2] and a. radioresistens [n=1]) were examined for their susceptibility to the four antineoplastic agents at therapeutic concentration. no inhibition was observed, but inhibition was seen at higher concentrations of both bleomycin and doxorubicin. time to detection of blood culture bottles containing  separate antineoplastic agents (i.e., bleomycin and doxorubicin) was compared to  that containing saline using a paired t-test. samples containing doxorubicin at 1 pg/ml were shown to have a mean time to detection of 21.8 h (range: 15.6-31.4 h). bottles containing saline had a mean time to detection of 22.9 h (range: 18.2-31.3 h). statistical analysis showed no significant difference (p=0.3361) between time to detection for blood culture bottles containing doxorubicin at achievable plasma concentration and corresponding negative controls. with regard  to bleomycin (300 miu/ml), the mean time to detection was 27.29 h (range: 20.2-38.4 h) in the test bottles, with mean time to detection in the saline negative controls of 22.56 h (range: 17.0-30.1 h). paired t-test gave p=0.000451, hence a significant difference in time to detection for blood cultures containing therapeutic levels of bleomycin. overall, the antineoplastic agents vincristine,  cisplatin or doxorubicin did not have any inhibitory effects on the acinetobacter organisms examined. at worst, therapeutic concentrations of bleomycin may delay automated detection of an acinetobacter bacteraemia by a mean time of 5.9 h.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == identification of the naturally occurring genes encoding carbapenem-hydrolysing oxacillinases from acinetobacter haemolyticus, acinetobacter johnsonii, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus.
AB  == carbapenem resistance is increasingly being reported among acinetobacter species, and results mostly from the expression of acquired carbapenem-hydrolysing oxacillinases (chdls). several acinetobacter species intrinsically possess chromosomal chdl genes: acinetobacter baumannii (bla(oxa-51) ), acinetobacter radioresistens (bla(oxa-23) ), and acinetobacter lwoffii (bla(oxa-134) ). we aimed to identify the progenitors of novel chdl-encoding genes for identification of potential reservoirs. we performed pcr screening using degenerated internal primers designed from a sequence alignment of the known chdls (oxa-23, oxa-40, oxa-51, oxa-58, oxa-134, and oxa-143) applied to a collection of 50 acinetobacter strains belonging to 23 different species. two strains of acinetobacter johnsonii, one strain of acinetobacter calcoaceticus and two strains of acinetobacter haemolyticus were found to harbour, respectively, the totally novel bla(oxa-211) -like, bla(oxa-213) -like and bla(oxa-214) -like genes. in addition, the complete genomes of those three species available in genbank, i.e. one a. johnsonii genome, four a. calcoaceticus genomes, and one a. haemolyticus genome,  were analysed and found to be positive for the presence of bla(oxa211) -like, bla(oxa-213) -like and bla(oxa-214) -like genes, respectively. the beta-lactamases oxa-211, oxa-213 and oxa-214 are diverse, with amino acid identities ranging from 53% to 76%, as compared with the naturally occurring oxa-51-like chdl from a. baumannii. these beta-lactamases showed a peculiar hydrolysis profile, including mostly penicillins and carbapenems. regarding bla(oxa-23) in a. radioresistens and bla(oxa-134) in a. lwoffii, these genes were not expressed (or expressed at a non-significant level) in their host. detection  of these beta-lactamase genes might be used as a useful tool for accurate identification of these acinetobacter species.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance profiles of acinetobacter species isolated from several clinical samples between 2007-2010].
AB  == this study was aimed to investigate the changes in antibiotic resistance profiles of acinetobacter spp. in our hospital during a four-year period. the study included a total of 465 non-duplicate acinetobacter spp. isolated from various samples sent from intensive care (n= 274, 58.9%), inpatient (n= 141, 30.3%) and outpatient (n= 49, 10.5%) units of our hospital between 2007 and 2010. sample distribution was as follows: 184 tracheal aspirates (39.5%), 70 blood (15.3%), 92 (19.8%) wound, 40 urine (8.6%), 24 sputum (5.1%), 22 (4.7%) bronchial lavage and  22 (4.7%) other (catheter tip, cerebrospinal fluid, thorasynthesis material) samples. the isolates were identified as a.baumannii (n= 340, 73.1%), a.lwoffii (n= 64, 13.7%) and acinetobacter spp. (n= 61, 13.1%). the susceptibility profiles were investigated by kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. overall, the results indicated an increase in resistance against all tested drugs since 2007. a steady increase of resistance from 2007 to 2009, followed by a tendency to decrease in 2010 was also noted for all drugs, except for ceftazidime (caz), trimethoprim-sulfomethoxazole (sxt), netilmicin (net), imipenem (ipm), meropenem  (mer) and gentamicin (cn). net, ipm, cefepime and mer resistance rates increased  regularly from 2007 to 2010. caz resistance followed a fluctuating course, while  cn resistance displayed a decreasing trend since 2009. according to the statistical analyses (x2 and fishers exact test), there was a regular resistance  increase between 2007-2009 except for amikacin (ak), sxt and pip. resistance rates were also increased for ak and pip, but only between 2007 and 2009; as well as for piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcilin-clavulanate, net, mer and ipm between  2008 and 2009. a significant increase from 2008 to 2010 was observed for net; and a significant resistance decrease in 2010 was noted for only sultamicillin, cefotaxime, cn and tobramycin (tob) (p< 0.05). as of 2010, the results indicated  high resistance rates against ciprofloxacin [resistance rate (rr): 79%], net (rr: 60%) and all beta-lactam drugs, including carbapenems (mean rr: 80%). moreover, there was a progressive increase in resistance to carbapenems and net, two very important treatment alternatives. tigecycline (rr: 5.5%), tob (rr: 19%), cn (rr:  34%) and cefoperazone-sulbactam (rr: 38%) appeared to remain as relatively effective treatment choices. the resistance rates of inpatient and outpatient isolates which were usually lower than those of the intensive care unit isolates, also displayed a noteworthy increase over the past four years. evidently, pan-resistant acinetobacter spp. will become a serious health problem in the near future, unless efficient and appropriate precautions are taken.

AB  == background: meropenem is empirically used as a last resort for the treatment of infections by non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb). minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined using agar or broth dilution methods is widely used for testing meropenem resistance. however, it is not possible in resource-poor settings. aim: a prospective study was performed to evaluate the reliability of kirby-bauer disk diffusion (kbdd) method for detecting meropenem resistance among nfgnb. materials and methods: a total of 146 nfgnb consisting of 56 acinetobacter baumannii, 24 acinetobacter lwoffii, 48 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 18 pseudomonas spp. were included in the study. all the isolates were tested  simultaneously by both kbdd method and agar dilution method. results: very major  errors were not observed with a. baumannii, a. lwoffii and p. aeruginosa, while other pseudomonas spp. showed a very major error rate of about 5.6%. the major error rates observed with a. baumannii, a. lwoffii, p. aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. were 1.8%, 0%, 2.1% and 28.6%, respectively. all the isolates showed a good  correlation between zone diameters (kbdd method) and mics (agar dilution method). the sensitivity and specificity of kbdd method for detecting meropenem resistance was above 90% for all the nfgnb except pseudomonas spp. conclusions: the kbdd method can be reliably used for routine testing of meropenem resistance in a. baumannii, a. lwoffii and p. aeruginosa. however, further studies are needed before employing this technique for detecting meropenem resistance in pseudomonas spp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and cytotoxic effects of magnolia dealbata and its active  compounds.
AB  == multi-drug resistance is of great concern for public health worldwide and necessitates the search for new antimicrobials from sources such as plants. several magnolia (magnoliaceae) species have been reported to exert antimicrobial effects on sensitive and multidrug-resistant microorganisms. however, the antimicrobial properties of magnolia dealbata have not been experimentally evaluated. the antimicrobial effects of an ethanol extract of magnolia dealbata seeds (mde) and its active compounds honokiol (hk) and magnolol (mg) were tested  against the phytopathogen clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis and several human multi-drug resistant pathogens using the disk-diffusion assay. the  effects of mde and its active compounds on the viability of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were evaluated using mtt assay. mde and its active compounds had antimicrobial activity (inhibition zone > 10 mm) against c. michiganensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter lwoffii, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and trichosporon belgeii. the results suggest that m. dealbata and its active compounds have selective antimicrobial effects against drug-resistant fungal and gram (-) bacteria and exert minimal toxic effects on human pmbc.

TI  == clinical impact and molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance in non-baumannii  acinetobacter.
AB  == species of acinetobacter other than acinetobacter baumannii are involved in nosocomial infections. acinetobacter lwoffii, acinetobacter genomospecies 3 and acinetobacter genomospecies 13tu are found in community- and nosocomial-acquired  infections as well as in neonatal intensive care units. the non-baumannii acinetobacter are normally highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin and tigecycline. carbepenems show good activity  although resistant isolates have been reported. resistance to beta-lactams other  than carbapenems is associated with overexpression of chromosomal cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase acquisition, whereas resistance to carbapenems involves acquisition of carbapenemases. quinolone resistance is related to gyra and/or parc mutations but overexpresion of efflux proteins also plays an important role. with the development of novel and more accurate typing methodologies, an increase in infections caused by non-baumannii  acinetobacter might be observed in the future.

TI  == biofilm formation by acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from urinary tract  infection and urinary catheters.
AB  == fifty acinetobacter isolates were obtained from urinary tract infections and urinary catheter samples. analytical profile index assays identified 47 isolates  as acinetobacter baumannii and three as acinetobacter lwoffii. six a. baumannii isolates (a1-a6) displayed hydrophobicity indices >70%. twenty isolates exhibited lectin activity. biofilm formation by these isolates was compared with those with low hydrophobicity index values (a45-a50). biofilms on different surfaces were confirmed by light microscopy, epifluorescence microscopy and by obtaining scanning electron microscope images. biofilm production was maximal at 30 degrees c, ph 7.0 in a medium with 5.0 g l(-1) nacl, and its efficiency was reduced on urinary catheter surfaces at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration concentrations  of colistin. plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance was observed in selected isolates of a. baumannii and experiments of conjugation and transformation showed the occurrence of gene transfer. plasmid curing was used to examine the function  of plasmids. five plasmids of a. baumannii a3 were cured but no differences were  observed between wild-type and plasmid-cured strains with respect to the biofilm  formation capabilities. the prevalence of a. baumannii strains with biofilm mode  of growth could explain their ability to persist in clinical environments and their role in device-related infections.

TI  == species identification and molecular characterization of acinetobacter spp. blood culture isolates from norway.
AB  == objectives: the study investigated the species distribution, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and genotypic resistance characteristics of 113 consecutive blood culture isolates of acinetobacter species collected between 2005 and 2007 throughout norway. methods: species identification was performed by partial rpob sequence analysis, and verified by 16s rdna and reca sequence analyses. susceptibility testing was performed by agar disc diffusion and etest.  distribution of oxa carbapenemase genes and epidemic clonality of acinetobacter baumannii isolates were detected by pcr assays. analyses of blaoxa-51-like variants and quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) were done by sequencing. results: the most prevalent species in the collection were acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 13tu (46.9%) and acinetobacter gen. sp.  3 (19.5%), followed by a. baumannii (8.8%) and acinetobacter lwoffii/acinetobacter gen. sp. 9 (7.1%). carbapenem resistance was observed in one blaoxa-23-like-positive a. baumannii isolate. quinolone resistance was detected in five isolates from the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex, of which two had point mutations in the qrdrs, including one novel parc  mutation. none of the a. baumannii isolates belonged to european/international clones i, ii or iii. six blaoxa-51-like variants, including two novel variants, were identified. conclusions: acinetobacter gen. sp. 13tu and acinetobacter gen.  sp. 3 were predominant in norwegian blood cultures, in contrast to in other countries where a. baumannii has dominated. the study demonstrated the importance of genotypic identification to determine the exact epidemiology of non-baumannii  acinetobacter species.

TI  == in vivo selection of a missense mutation in ader and conversion of the novel blaoxa-164 gene into blaoxa-58 in carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii isolates from a hospitalized patient.
AB  == the mechanism of stepwise acquired multidrug resistance in acinetobacter baumannii isolates from a hospitalized patient was investigated. thirteen consecutive multidrug-resistant isolates were recovered from the same patient over a 2-month period. the vitek 2 system identified the isolates as meropenem-sensitive acinetobacter lwoffii; however, molecular identification showed that the isolates were a. baumannii. etest revealed that the isolates were meropenem resistant. the presence of oxacillinase (oxa)-type enzymes were investigated by sequencing. the clonal relatedness of isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). expression of the genes encoding the efflux pumps adeb and adej was performed by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr). the aders two-component system was sequenced. all isolates had identical pfge fingerprints, suggesting clonal identity. the first six isolates were positive for the novel bla(oxa-164) gene. the following seven isolates, recovered after treatment with a combination of meropenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and co-trimoxazole showed an increase of >7-fold in adeb mrna transcripts and a missense mutation in bla(oxa-164), converting it to bla(oxa-58). sequencing revealed a novel mutation in ader. these data illustrate  how a. baumannii can adapt during antimicrobial therapy, leading to increased antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == strains belonging to the genus acinetobacter and their plant growth-promoting properties have been reported in the literature. however, there is a paucity of information on the diversity of acinetobacter species associated with the wheat rhizosphere. in the present investigation, acinetobacter species diversity was assessed in the rhizosphere of wheat from three agricultural fields where different varieties were cultivated. the acinetobacter species diversity was assessed by dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) of 16s rrna gene pcr products amplified from total soil dna using genus-specific primers. ac. calcoaceticus, ac. baumannii, ac. lwoffii, ac. baylyi and acinetobacter sp. were  detected in the rhizosphere of wheat. prevalence of acinetobacter species in the  rhizosphere of wheat was also investigated by a cultivation-dependent approach. ac. calcoaceticus, ac. baumannii, ac. lwoffii and acinetobacter sp. were isolated on selective media from the same samples. in vitro characterization of acinetobacter isolates revealed that majority of these bacteria exhibited plant growth-promoting traits such as nitrogen fixation, siderophore production and mineral solubilization. these acinetobacter strains may play a favorable role in  plant growth promotion while residing in the rhizosphere of wheat.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance and existence of metallo-beta-lactamase in acinetobacter species isolated from adult patients].
AB  == acinetobacter spp. are the frequent causes of nosocomial infections which are difficult to treat due to multidrug resistance. the aim of this study was to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities and the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases in acinetobacter spp. isolated from patients admitted to  hacettepe university adult hospital. a total of 124 acinetobacter spp. isolates were included in the study. antibiotic susceptibilities against imipenem (imp), meropenem (mer), ceftazidime (caz), ciprofloxacin (cip) and aztreonam (azt) were  studied by microdilution susceptibility testing according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. multidrug-resistant isolates (mdr) were further tested for susceptibility against colistin by microdilution, and against amikacin (an), piperacillin-tazobactam (pip-taz), cefepime (fep), ceftriaxone (cro), tetracycline (tet), trimetoprim-sulfomethoxazole (sxt) and mezlocillin (mez) by disk diffusion method according to clsi guidelines. each isolate was also tested for metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) production by using imp  and edta combined disk diffusion test and molecular analysis for bla(imp-1) and bla(vim-2) genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). among 124 non-duplicate isolates, 72 were identified as acinetobacter baumannii and 52 as acinetobacter lwoffii. minimum inhibitor concentration 50 (mic50) and minimum inhibitor concentration 90 (mic90) values of the isolates were 32 and 128 microg/ml for imp, 16 and 32 microg/ml for mer, 128 and 256 microg/ml for cip, 64 and 256 microg/ml for caz, 128 and 256 microg/ml for azt, respectively. forty-three (34.7%) isolates were susceptible to imp. overall, 51 (41%) acinetobacter spp. were found to be resistant to > or = 3 antibiotics belonging to different antimicrobial classes and defined as mdr. colistin mic50 and mic90 values were 2 and 8 microg/ml, respectively and the rate of colistin resistance was 27.5% in mdr isolates. the resistance rates for an, pip-taz, fep, cro, tet, sxt and mez were 80.4%, 98%, 92.2%, 100%, 100%, 86.3% and 86.3%, respectively. among 124 isolates, 64 (51.6%) yielded positive result by imp-edta combined disk  test, and all the isolates were negative in terms of the tested mbl genes by pcr. these data revealed high level resistance among the acinetobacter population in our hospital. the high rate of carbapenem resistance and increasing colistin resistance among acinetobacter isolates should be surveyed cautiously. the increasing incidence of multidrug resistant acinetobacter spp. emphasizes the need for new and effective treatment options.

TI  == endemic and epidemic acinetobacter species in a university hospital: an 8-year survey.
AB  == the prevalence of the currently known acinetobacter species and related trends of antimicrobial resistance in a dutch university hospital were studied. between 1999 and 2006, acinetobacter isolates from clinical samples were collected prospectively. isolates were analyzed by amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting. for species identification, a profile similarity cutoff level of  50% was used, and for strain identification, a cutoff level of 90% was used. susceptibility for antimicrobial agents was tested by disk diffusion by following the clsi guideline. the incidences of acinetobacter isolates ranged from 1.7 to 3.7 per 10,000 patients per year, without a trend of increase, during the study years. twenty different species were distinguished. acinetobacter baumannii (27%) and acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 (26%) were the most prevalent. other species seen relatively frequently were acinetobacter lwoffii (11%), acinetobacter ursingii (4%), acinetobacter johnsonii (4%), and acinetobacter junii (3%). one large cluster of a. baumannii, involving 31 patients, and 16 smaller clusters of various species, involving in total 39 patients, with at most 5 patients in 1 cluster, occurred. overall, 37% of the a. baumannii isolates were fully susceptible to the tested antibiotics. there was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) trend of decreasing susceptibility. a. baumannii was the acinetobacter species causing the largest burden of multiple-antibiotic resistance and transmissions in the hospital.

TI  == simple screening tests for detection of carbapenemases in clinical isolates of nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background & objective: the production of carbapenemases is an important mechanism responsible for the carbapenem resistance. a simple and inexpensive testing method for screening of carbapenemase producers is essential. a prospective study was undertaken to detect metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) and ampc beta-lactamases in nonfermentative gram negative bacteria and to evaluate the various methods for detection of carbapenemases and mbls. methods: a total of 100 acinetobacter spp. (78 a. baumannii and 22 a. lwoffii) and 140 pseudomonas spp. (103 p. aeruginosa and 37 other pseudomonas spp.) were screened for meropenem resistance by kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. modified hodge test, edta disk synergy (eds) test and ampc disk test were used for the detection of carbapenemases, mbls and ampc beta-lactamases, respectively. results: forty six (59.0%) a. baumannii, 7 (31.8%) a. lwoffii, 32 (31.1%) p. aeruginosa and 7 (18.9%) pseudomonas spp. were resistant to meropenem. among the 32 meropenem resistant p. aeruginosa, 15 (46.9%) were ampc beta-lactamase producers, 16 (50.0%) mbl producers by eds test, but only 9 (28.1%) found positive for carbapenemases by modified hodge test. among the 46 meropenem resistant a. baumannii, 31 (67.4%) were ampc beta-lactamase producers, 3 (6.5%) mbl producers, but only 1 (14.3%) was positive for carbapenemases by modified hodge test. one p. aeruginosa was positive for carbapenemase by modified hodge test, but was negative for mbl and ampc beta-lactamase. interpretation & conclusion: mbl production is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance among pseudomonas species but not among acinetobacter species. eds is more sensitive for detection  of mbls than modifi ed hodge test. both edta-meropenem and edta-ceftazidime combination must be used to detect all the mbl producers. carbapenemases other than mbl may also be responsible for carbapenem resistance. ampc beta-lactamase is also a contributory factor for carbapenem resistance among the isolates in the hospital.

TI  == nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli infections in a tertiary care hospital in kolar, karnataka.
AB  == aim: nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb), which are saprophytic in nature, have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens. they exhibit resistance not only to beta lactam and the other groups of antibiotics, but also  to carbapenems. this study was undertaken to identify the nonfermenters isolated  from various clinical samples, to assess their clinical significance, to know the type of healthcare-associated infections they caused, and to know their anti-microbial sensitivity pattern. materials and methods: the nonfermenters were identified using a standard protocol that included tests for motility, oxidase production, oxidation-fermentation test for various sugars, gelatin liquefaction, and growth on 10% lactose agar. the clinical significance was assessed by using various criteria and susceptibility testing was performed with the help of the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. results: a total of 193 nfgnb were isolated from 189 clinical specimens. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common nonfermenter, accounting for 53.8%, followed by acinetobacter baumannii (22.2%),  and pseudomonas fluorescens (10.8%). other significant nfgnb isolated were: sphingobacterium species (5.2%), acinetobacter lwoffii (3.1%), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.6%). p. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem (94%), cefoperazone (70%), amikacin (69%), and ticarcillin (63%). a. baumannii showed 100% sensitivity to imipenem and 70% sensitivity to piperacillin. conclusion: p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii were the common nfgnb isolated in our study from patients of, urinary tract infection, bacteremia, surgical site infections, and ventilator associated pneumonia. p. aeruginosa showed good sensitivity to imipenem, amikacin, and cefoperazone while a. baumannii showed good sensitivity to imipenem and piperacillin.

TI  == validation of partial rpob gene sequence analysis for the identification of clinically important and emerging acinetobacter species.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus acinetobacter are ubiquitous in soil and water. only a few species, including acinetobacter baumannii, and the unnamed acinetobacter genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 and 13tu, which together with the soil organism acinetobacter calcoaceticus are combined in the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii (acb) complex, have been recognized as important nosocomial infectious  agents. the ecology, epidemiology and pathology of most species are not yet well  established. lack of practical and accurate methods limits routine identification of clinical isolates and thus hampers precise identification of those of the acb  complex and other acinetobacter species of possible clinical significance. we previously identified a 350 bp highly variable zone on the rpob gene which appeared to be a promising target for rapid molecular identification. in the present study, we validated this method for accuracy on a collection of reference strains belonging to a. calcoaceticus (5 strains), acinetobacter gen. sp. 3 (29 strains), a. gen. sp. 13tu (18 strains), a. baumannii (30 strains) and one strain each of a. radioresistens, a. gen. sp. 15tu, a. gen. sp. 10, a. gen. sp. 11, a. gen. sp. 'between 1 and 3' and a. gen. sp. 14tu=13bj. this represents the largest analysis to date that compares a large number of well-identified strains of the acb complex to assess the intra- and interspecies variation within this complex.  all were correctly identified with 98.9-100 % intraspecies relatedness based on partial rpob sequence analysis. we then applied this tool to identify 99 acinetobacter clinical isolates from four public hospitals in marseille, france.  all isolates could easily be identified to species as they were separated into 13 species sequence types with a sequence variance of 0-2.6% from their respective type strains. of these 99 isolates, 10 were a. haemolyticus, 52 were a. baumannii, 27 were a. gen. sp. 3, 5 were a. schindleri, 1 was a. lwoffii, and 1 was a. gen. sp. 13tu. three were provisionally identified as a. gen. sp. 9. this  is the first work to identify all specimens of a set of clinical acinetobacter isolates at species level using rpob sequence analysis. our data emphasize the recognition of a. schindleri as an emerging cause of acinetobacter-related infection and confirm that a. gen. sp. 3 is the second most commonly isolated acinetobacter species after a. baumannii in patients.

TI  == galleria mellonella as a model system to study acinetobacter baumannii pathogenesis and therapeutics.
AB  == nonmammalian model systems of infection such as galleria mellonella (caterpillars of the greater wax moth) have significant logistical and ethical advantages over  mammalian models. in this study, we utilize g. mellonella caterpillars to study host-pathogen interactions with the gram-negative organism acinetobacter baumannii and determine the utility of this infection model to study antibacterial efficacy. after infecting g. mellonella caterpillars with a reference a. baumannii strain, we observed that the rate of g. mellonella killing was dependent on the infection inoculum and the incubation temperature postinfection, with greater killing at 37 degrees c than at 30 degrees c (p = 0.01). a. baumannii strains caused greater killing than the less-pathogenic species acinetobacter baylyi and acinetobacter lwoffii (p < 0.001). community-acquired a. baumannii caused greater killing than a reference hospital-acquired strain (p < 0.01). reduced levels of production of the quorum-sensing molecule 3-hydroxy-c(12)-homoserine lactone caused no change in a. baumannii virulence against g. mellonella. treatment of a lethal a. baumannii infection with antibiotics that had in vitro activity against the infecting a. baumannii strain significantly prolonged the survival of g. mellonella caterpillars compared with treatment with antibiotics to which the bacteria were  resistant. g. mellonella is a relatively simple, nonmammalian model system that can be used to facilitate the in vivo study of host-pathogen interactions in a. baumannii and the efficacy of antibacterial agents.

TI  == [electron microscopic analysis of biofilm on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates and the relationship between bilofilm and lower respiratory infection].
AB  == objective: mechanical ventilation support is a very important method for the salvage of serious patients. however, it can result in the formation of an adherent matrix of bacteria on the surfaces of implanted materials which is termed "biofilm". biofilm is dense bacterial communities attached to a solid surface and surrounded by an exopolysaccharide matrix. one of the most important  features of bacterial biofilm is their resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune system components. as a consequence, diseases involving biofilm are generally chronic and difficult to treat. the present study was conducted to explore the relationship between ett-biofilm and the lower respiratory infection  by observing microbial colonization and associated biofilm accumulation on the surface of endotracheal tubes (etts) removed from neonates treated with intubated mechanical ventilation. methods: twenty neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation (from january to june in 2005) were recruited into this study. clinical data about lower respiratory infection for each case were collected. etts were collected at the first time of extubation. a sterile control tube was also processed. for each ett, a 1-cm-long cross-sectional segment was divided into two portions for both scanning electron microscopy (sem) and aerobic/anaerobic cultures. the presence of biofilm on the surface of etts were examined by sem, meanwhile, bacteria harvested from the surface of etts and the secretions of lower respiratory tract were isolated, identified and assessed on antimicrobial susceptibility, respectively. results: the diagnosis on admission of the twenty cases included: neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (10), meconium aspirate syndrome (2), severe asphyxia (2), pneumatothorax (2), severe pneumonia (1), scleredema neonatorum (1), inborn pulmonary hypoplasia (1) and recurrent apnea (1). thirteen cases did not present symptoms and signs of lower respiratory infection before mechanical ventilation. however, during the mechanical ventilation process, symptoms and signs of lower respiratory infection presented and lasted until extubation. nine of the above mentioned thirteen cases (70%) had the same duration of tube use as mechanical ventilation duration (mean: 3.6 days). observation by sem showed that colonization was time dependent and the incidence of microbial colonization increased when the duration of tube use exceeded one days (12/20). there were no obvious bacterial colonies except that some amorphous material was noted in 5 of 20 etts as early as one day of tube use. up to 2 days of tube use (4/20), attached bacterial colonization was seen embedded in amorphous material (3/4). up to 3 days (7/20), a layer of biofilm formation presented on etts (5/7). furthermore, biofilm architecture became more  mature and complex if the duration exceeded 3 days. neither bacteria nor biofilm  formation was seen on the control ett. the results of aerobic/anaerobic cultures  showed that there were 14 cultures from etts (normal flora grew in 4) and 7 pathogens were isolated; 13 cultures from the secretions of lower respiratory tract (normal flora grew in 1) and 10 pathogens were isolated. seven samples had  the same pathogen both on the surface of etts and in the secretions of lower respiratory tract, which accounted for 50% of the positive cultures from etts, including xanthomonas maltophilia (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), acinetobacter lwoffii (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1) and normal flora (1). the gram-negative  bacteria isolated from the surface of etts and the secretions of lower respiratory tract presented multi-resistance to antibiotics. conclusions: the ett-biofilm develops into mature and complex form with the duration of tube use increase. this study provides evidence that there is correlation between microbial colonization, biofilm formation on the surface of etts and the lower respiratory infection in neonates who were intubated and ventilated for a prolonged period. ett-biofilm could also be a possible source of the recurrent infection. increased attention must be paid to modification of the ett to prevent or substantially reduce biofilm formation.

TI  == characterization and changing minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of acinetobacter species from a tertiary care setup.
AB  == 128 isolates of acinetobacter species from admitted and outdoor patients were subjected to biotyping and resistotyping. resistance phenotype analysis included  nine antibiotics and two betalactam inhibitor combination drugs. in 100 strains of acinetobacter spp. ciprofloxacin, amikacin, cefotaxime and cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was done by agar dilution using nccls 2002 criteria. in forty-nine isolates mic level was determined by e-strip also. extended spectrum beta lactamase (esbl) production was detected by double disc synergy technique. inducible beta lactamases (ibl's) were detected by disc approximation method. the relationship between biotypes and resistance phenotype  was analyzed. majority of isolates (93.75%) were from admitted patients. the biotyping revealed acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex (87.2%) to be the predominant species and they were isolated from tracheal aspirates of patients with ventilator associated pneumonia. by kirby bauer disc diffusion antimicrobial sensitivity testing acinetobacter spp. were most sensitive to the combination of drug cefoperazone-sulbactam (95.6%) followed by meropenem (94.6%), piperacillin-tazobactam (92.6%). on screening incidence of imipenem nonsensitive acinetobacter spp. (insa) was (5.4%). acinetobacter spp. were typable by six resistance phenotypes and six biotypes. most common (66.6%) resistant phenotype of a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex was susceptible to cefoperazone-sulbactam and or meropenem and or piperacillin-tazobactam. esbl production was seen in 6% and ibl (inducible beta lactamase) production was seen  in 7% of acinetobacter spp. the mic90 for ciprofloxacin was =256 microg/ml, cefotaxime 512 microg/ml, cefepime 512 microg/ml, and amikacin 32 microg/ml. multidrug resistance was seen in more than 90% of a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex and 20% of acinetobacter lwoffii. acinetobacter spp. has other emerging novel mechanism of resistance that requires continuous research. simpler, reproducible and reliable methods of biotyping and their subsequent correlation with resistotyping are more cost effective than molecular methods, which are available only in reference laboratories.

TI  == experimental infection of human body lice with acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the human body louse is currently recognized as a vector of rickettsia prowazekii, borrelia recurrentis, and bartonella quintana. previous studies have  reported the isolation of acinetobacter baumannii from the body lice of homeless  patients. to study how the body louse acquires a. baumannii, we infected a rabbit by infusing 2 x 10(6) colony-forming units of the louse strain of a. baumannii. two hundred body lice were infected by feeding on the bacteremic rabbit and compared with 200 uninfected lice and two groups of 200 lice feeding on rabbits infected either with another strain of a. baumannii or a. lwoffii. each louse group received maintenance feedings once a day on another seronegative rabbit. body lice that fed on rabbits infused with each acinetobacter species demonstrated a generalized infection. the body lice did not transmit their infection to the nurse rabbit by bite while feeding or to their progeny (eggs and larvae). the lice excreted living acinetobacter species within their feces. only  the louse strain of a. baumannii was pathogenic for the body louse. an increased  mortality rate was observed between the second and third days post-infection; however, they remained infected for their lifespan.

TI  == adult acinetobacter meningitis and its comparison with non-acinetobacter gram-negative bacterial meningitis.
AB  == between january 1999 and december 2003, 81 cases of single pathogen-related culture-proven gram-negative adult bacterial meningitis were identified at chang  gung memorial hospital-kaohsiung. of these 81 cases, acinetobacter infection was  found in 13 cases. clinical and laboratory data of these acinetobacter meningitis patients were studied and were compared with those of other 68 non-acinetobacter  gram-negative bacterial meningitis (gnbm) patients. of the 13 implicated acinetobacter strains, a. baumannii was the most common (12), and the other was a. lwoffii (1). eleven of these 13 cases were due to a post-neurosurgical infection. the results of the antibiotic susceptibility test of the 13 acinetobacter strains from cerebrospinal fluid included ceftriaxone, (1/13, 8%),  ciprofloaxin (6/13, 46%), ceftazidime (6/13, 46%), cefepime (7/13, 54%), ampicillin-subtactam (7/13, 54%), imipenem (12/13, 92%) and meropenem (12/13, 92%). one strain with pan-drug resistant a. baumannii (pdrab) emerged in 2003. a  statistically significant difference between acinetobacter meningitis and non-acinetobacter gnbm included hydrocephalus and ceftazidime-resistance. a mortality rate was 30% (4/13), and 7 of the other 9 survivals had severe neurologic deficits. the emergence of acinetobacter infections in adult post-neurosurgical infections, multiple antibiotic resistant characteristics, and the emergence of pdrab strain remained a challenge of the initial management of this specific meningitis. use of carbapenem, especially meropenem, could be considered as one of the initial empiric antibiotics chosen for the management of adult post-neurosurgical meningitis.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == acinetobacter bacteraemia in a teaching hospital, 1989-1998.
AB  == background: the mortality rate from bacteraemia is one of the highest among infections in hospitals, especially in the intensive care unit (icu). recently, an increase in nosocomial bacteraemia caused by gram-negative resistant pathogens has been observed. in this work we review the clinical and laboratory findings of adult patients with acinetobacter bacteraemia in order to identify risk factors associated with mortality. methods: a retrospective review of the medical records of patients with acinetobacter bacteraemia identified by blood cultures from the  diagnostic microbiology laboratory was conducted between january 1989 and march 1998. results: we identified 59 cases of acinetobacter bacteraemia. most of the infections (71%) were nosocomial; the majority occurred in the department of internal medicine (28.8%), followed by haematology (27%) and the icu (23%). a. lwoffii was isolated in 52.5% of cases and a. baumannii in 47.5%. the related mortality was 17%. staying in the icu was associated with a. baumannii bacteraemia (p<0.004). an intravascular catheter was the leading source of infection (37%). main risk factors were mechanical ventilation (28%), parenteral  nutrition (23%) and the presence of a urinary catheter (22%). in the multivariate analysis the independent prognostic factors for mortality were the presence of shock (p<0.05) and the severity of the underlying disease, according to the classification of mccabe (p<0.05). conclusions: the incidence of acinetobacter bacteraemia has increased in the last decade, mainly since 1995. the development  of septic shock and the severity of the underlying disease appear to be associated with an increase in mortality.

TI  == cerebrospinal meningitis with the presence of acinetobacter spp.
AB  == the study was conducted on 16 strains of acinetobacter sp. which were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. the diagnostic material was analysed with the use of automatic bact/alert system (organon teknika). the analysis was performed in the  department of microbiology, medical university in bydgoszcz. api 20ne system (biomerieux) enabled the identification of 14 strains (87.5%) as a. baumannii, 1  strain as a. haemolyticus and 1 strain as a. lwoffii. the micro-organisms were isolated from patients whose age ranged between 4 and 66 years. these patients were treated in the departments of neurosurgery (75.0%), neurology (18.8%) and intensive therapy (6.2%). the infection of cerebrospinal fluid was caused by injury and subsequent exposure to the bacteria present in external environment. antibiotic-sensitivity of these micro-organisms was evaluated with the help of disc-diffusion method, observing standardisation conditions outlined by nccls. all the strains proved sensitive to carbapenems, 15 strains were sensitive to netilmicin, 7 strains--to tobramycin and 7 strains--to amikacin. all the strains  displayed multiple resistance. the only exception was a. haemolyticus. the use of two-discs allowed for the detection of esbls in 7 a. baumannii strains. positive  results were most frequently obtained after the combination of sublactam and aztreonam. due to microscopic resemblance between acinetobacter spp., and bacteria of neisseria, moraxella and haemophilus genus, microbiological diagnostics should not be restricted to microscopic assessment of cerebrospinal fluid and quick serological tests evaluating the antigens of the most frequent aetiological factors. considering multiple resistance of acinetobacter spp. to antibiotics, the treatment should be based on sensitivity tests and the ability of a given antibiotic to penetrate into cerebrospinal fluid. in our opinion, both reasonable antibiotic policy as well as observing the principles of hygiene and monitoring infections play equally important roles in the prevention of infections with acinetobacter spp. such combined measures may help to prevent the spreading of multiple resistant strains in hospital environment.

AB  == genomic species diversity among 147 acinetobacter clinical isolates not belonging to the a. calcoaceticus- a. baumannii (acb) complex was investigated by phenotypic and genotypic identification methods. the isolates were obtained between 1991 and 1999 from numerous diagnostic laboratories in the czech republic and were studied by numerical probabilistic identification using two biochemical  frequency matrices and amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra). their final identification was derived from the combined phenotypic and ardra results. in total, 102 isolates were unambiguously (n = 89) or presumptively (n = 13) identified as a. lwoffii (n = 63), genomic species 13bj/14tu (n = 9), a. johnsonii (n = 7), a. haemolyticus (n = 6), a. junii (n = 5), and other genomic species (n < 5 isolates each). forty-five isolates could not be identified as belonging to any described species. among the unidentified isolates two large groups of non-glucose-acidifying, nonhemolytic, and non-gelatinase-producing isolates were distinguished. these groups, designated phenon 1 (n = 17) and phenon 2 (n = 15), had distinctive phenotypic features and novel ardra profiles,  which suggests that they represent hitherto undescribed acinetobacter species. phenon 2 included mainly clinically insignificant isolates from outpatients, while phenon 1 comprised clinically relevant isolates mostly from the blood of hospitalized patients, and its precise taxonomic definition may therefore be of medical importance. overall, the development of practical methods for identification required for the elucidation of the biological significance of the (genomic) species within the genus acinetobacter remains a challenging task.

AB  == one of the important factors contributing to the pathogenicity of bacteria is the presence of adhesins on cell surface, which facilitate colonisation in the macroorganism. the presence and type of adhesins occurring in four species of the genus acinetobacter: a. baumannii (184), a. junii (59), a. lwoffii (65) and a. haemolyticus (22) was determined by haemagglutination test with a 3% suspension of fresh, tannic acid-treated of guinea pig, cow and human group o and ab erythrocytes, with or without the addition of one of sugar inhibitors (d-mannose, alpha-methylmannopyranoside, d-galactose-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-fucose and d-ribose). in strains from all species, adhesines of the mannose-resistant (mr) type dominated. the mannose-sensitive (ms) type was present solely on the surface of one a. lwoffii strains. a. baumannii (36), a. junii (8), a. lwoffii (11) and a. haemolyticus (4) exhibited mannose-resistant hemagglutination in relation to fresh erythrocytes and that reaction was restrained by d-galactose, d-galactose and l-fucose (no other inhibitor used restrained it). the results achieved prove  that cell adhesines other than those of mr type must be present on the cell surface. additional adhesines occurred mainly in strains isolated from the respiratory and urinary tract infection simples, but were not found in isolates from blood cultures.

TI  == acinetobacter bacteremia in hong kong: prospective study and review.
AB  == the epidemiological characteristics of 18 patients with acinetobacter bacteremia  were analyzed. patients (mean age, 55.5 years) developed bacteremia after an average of 14.1 days of hospitalization. fifteen of 16 patients survived bacteremia caused by acinetobacter baumannii. cultures of blood from the remaining two patients yielded acinetobacter lwoffii. most patients (78%) resided in the general ward, while four patients (22%) were under intensive care. genotyping by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction analysis and the temporal sequence of isolation were more useful than phenotyping by antimicrobial susceptibility in the determination of the source of bacteremia, and the intravascular catheter was the leading infection source (39% of cases). the possibility of an association of glucose with the pathogenesis of acinetobacter infection was raised.

TI  == effect of desiccation on the ultrastructural appearances of acinetobacter baumannii and acinetobacter lwoffii.
AB  == an acinetobacter baumannii isolate survived desiccation beyond 30 days and an acinetobacter lwoffii isolate up to 21 days. for both species, desiccation resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of round cells (a baumannii, 40% to 80%; a lwoffii, 51% to 63%) and a significant decrease in rod shaped cells (a baumannii, 58% to 13%; a lwoffii, 46% to 34%). electronmicroscopic examination showed that there was also a corresponding significant increase in the cell wall  thickness (a baumannii, up to 53%; a lwoffii, up to 26%). desiccated a baumannii  cells became more electron-dense and had significantly thicker cell walls (x1.3)  than those of a lwoffii. cell wall structures of a baumannii strains with different abilities to resist desiccation deserve further study.

TI  == exceptional desiccation tolerance of acinetobacter radioresistens.
AB  == the taxonomy of the genus acinetobacter, which includes several important nosocomial pathogens, has been confused due to a lack of discriminatory phenotypic characteristics for identification. molecular methods such as amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) now enable the accurate identification of species. ten clinical isolates of acinetobacter radioresistens  had genospecies confirmed by ardra but the apj 20ne system, commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories, mis-identified them as acinetobacter lwoffii. desiccation resistance of acinetobacter spp. is an important attribute for their  survival in the clinical environment. we investigated the ability of a. radioresistens to survive desiccation using an established glass surface model and compared the results to a. lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii. the 10 strains of a. radioresistens were extremely resistant to desiccation and survived for an average of 157 days at 31% relative humidity (rh). in contrast, two strains of a. lwoffii and three strains of a. baumannii survived for an average of three and 20 days respectively, at 31% rh, which was used as an approximation  to climatic conditions in uk hospitals. a. radioresistens is thus well adapted for survival in the hospital environment and carriage on human skin and yet it is reported less frequently than a. lwoffii amongst clinical isolates. cases of a. radioresistens infection may be under-reported due to mis-identification as a. lwoffii and further studies that use molecular identification methods are required to elucidate the role of a. radioresistens in human disease.

TI  == identification of acinetobacters on blood agar in presence of d-glucose by unique browning effect.
AB  == a positive phenotypic characteristic of glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters was demonstrated with blood agar containing d-glucose. glucose-oxidizing acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter genospecies 3, acinetobacter lwoffii, and  acinetobacter genospecies 13 sensu tjernberg and ursing caused a unique brown discoloration of media supplemented with 5% blood (of horse, sheep, or human origin) and an aldose sugar (0.22 m d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-xylose,  or lactose). the browning effect was not observed when a ketose sugar (d-fructose or sucrose) was substituted for the aldose sugar or under high osmolarity in the  presence of mannitol, glycerol, or sodium chloride. other gram-negative nonfermenters (non-glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters, pseudomonas aeruginosa, other pseudomonas spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, flavobacterium spp., and moraxella spp.) did not cause similar discoloration. this novel browning effect may serve as an alternative trait for identifying glucose-oxidizing acinetobacters.

TI  == distribution of acinetobacter species on human skin: comparison of phenotypic and genotypic identification methods.
AB  == at least 19 genomic species are recognized as constituting the genus acinetobacter. however, little is known about the natural reservoirs of the various members of the genus. an epidemiological study was therefore performed to investigate the colonization with acinetobacter spp. of the skin and mucous membranes of 40 patients hospitalized in a cardiology ward and 40 healthy controls. single samples were obtained once from each of nine different body sites, i.e., forehead, ear, nose, throat, axilla, hand, groin, perineum, and toe  web. identification of acinetobacter isolates was achieved by using phenotypic properties and was compared to identification by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. selected isolates were further investigated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ribotyping, and dna-dna hybridization. plasmid profile analysis was used for epidemiological typing. thirty patients (75%) and 17 controls (42.5%) were found to be colonized with acinetobacter spp., and the colonization rates of patients increased during their hospital stay. the most frequently isolated species were acinetobacter lwoffii (47%), a. johnsonii (21%), a. radioresistens (12%), and dna group 3 (11%). in contrast, a. baumannii and dna group 13tu, the most important nosocomial acinetobacter spp., were found only rarely on human skin (0.5 and 1%, respectively) and their natural habitat remains to be defined. a good correlation between phenotypic and genotypic methods for identification of acinetobacter spp. was observed, and only two isolates could not be assigned to any of the known dna groups.

TI  == discrimination of acinetobacter genomic species by aflp fingerprinting.
AB  == aflp is a novel genomic fingerprinting method based on the selective pcr amplification of restriction fragments. the usability of this method for the differentiation of genomic species in the genus acinetobacter was investigated. a total of 151 classified strains (representing 18 genomic species, including type, reference, and field strains) and 8 unclassified strains were analyzed. by using  a single set of restriction enzymes (hindiii and taqi) and one particular set of  selective pcr primers, all strains could be allocated to the correct genomic species and all groups were properly separated, with minimal intraspecific similarity levels ranging from 29 to 74%. strains belonging to genomic species 8  (acinetobacter lwoffii sensu stricto) and 9 grouped together in one cluster. the  closely related dna groups 1 (acinetobacter calcoaceticus), 2 (acinetobacter baumannii), 3 and 13tu (sensu tjernberg & ursing 1989) were clearly distinguishable, with intraspecific linkage levels above 50%. strains of the independently described genomic species 13bj (sensu bouvet & jeanjean 1989) and 14tu linked together at a relatively low level (33%). although a previous dna-dna hybridization study seemed to justify the unification of these genomic species, aflp analysis actually divides the 13bj-14tu group into three well-separated subgroups. finally, four unclassified strains obtained from diverse sources and origins grouped convincingly together, with a similarity linkage level of approximately 50%. these strains showed no similarities in their aflp patterns with any of the other 155 strains studied and may represent a thus-far-undescribed acinetobacter species. based on these results, aflp should be regarded as an important auxiliary method for the delineation of genomic species. furthermore, because aflp provides a detailed insight into the infraspecific structure of acinetobacter taxa, the method also represents a highly effective means for the confirmation of strain identity in the epidemiology of acinetobacters.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of acinetobacter strains based on the nucleotide sequences  of gyrb genes and on the amino acid sequences of their products.
AB  == partial nucleotide sequences of the gyrb genes (dna gyrase b subunit genes) of 15 acinetobacter strains, including the type and reference strains of genomic species 1 to 12 (a. calcoaceticus [genomic species 1], a. baumannii [genomic species 2], acinetobacter genomic species 3, a. haemolyticus [genomic species 4], a. junii [genomic species 5], acinetobacter genomic species 6, a. johnsonii [genomic species 7], a. lwoffii [genomic species 8], acinetobacter genomic species 9, acinetobacter genomic species 10, acinetobacter genomic species 11, and a. radioresistens [genomic species 12]), were determined by sequencing the pcr-amplified fragments of gyrb. the gyrb sequence homology among these acinetobacter strains ranged from 69.6 to 99.7%. a phylogenetic analysis, using the gyrb sequences, indicates that genomic species 1, 2, and 3 formed one cluster (87.3 to 90.3% identity), while genomic species 8 and 9 formed another cluster (99.7% identity). these results are consistent with those of dna-dna hybridization and of biochemical systematics. on the other hand, the topology of  the published phylogenetic tree based on the 16s rrna sequences of the acinetobacter strains was quite different from that of the gyrb-based tree. the numbers of substitution in the 16s rrna gene sequences were not high enough to construct a reliable phylogenetic tree. the gyrb-based analysis indicates that the genus acinetobacter is highly diverse and that a reclassification of this genus would be required.

TI  == evaluation of the ability of a commercial system to identify acinetobacter genomic species.
AB  == a collection of 130 acinetobacter strains identified by dna hybridization to 18 different genomic species was used to assess the ability of the api 20ne system (biomerieux, france) to identify acinetobacter genomic species and to determine its accuracy. fifty-eight (87%) of the 67 strains of genomic species defined in the database (version 5.1) were identified to the appropriate genomic species. the acinetobacter baumannii strains and the acinetobacter haemolyticus strains were all identified correctly. three of five acinetobacter junii strains, three of eight acinetobacter johnsonii strains, and 11 of 13 acinetobacter lwoffii strains were also identified correctly. the 58 correctly identified strains represented 45% of the total 130 strains. thirty-six of the 72 inappropriately identified strains were designated acinetobacter baumannii. thirty-one of these 36 strains belonged to genomic species 1 (acinetobacter calcoaceticus), 3, or 13tu. analysis of the profiles showed that the api system does not discriminate between genomic species 1, 2, 3, and 13tu. lumping of these groups into the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex in the api 20ne database would make the system considerably more accurate. incorporation of these data into the database may improve identification of the remaining genomic species, including some that are not defined. however, the discriminative power of the tests in the api galleries is insufficient for correct identification of all acinetobacter genomic species.

TI  == characterization of the chromosomal cephalosporinases produced by acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates.
AB  == the beta-lactamases produced by acinetobacter lwoffii ula-501, acinetobacter baumannii ula-187, and a. baumannii ac-14 strains were purified and characterized, and their kinetic interactions with several beta-lactam molecules, including substrates and inhibitors, were studied in detail. the three enzymes appeared to be cephalosporinases with different acylation efficiencies (kcat/km ratio values), and their hydrolytic activities were inhibited by benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, and cefotaxime, which did not behave as substrates. carbenicillin was a substrate for the beta-lactamase from a. lwoffii  ula-501, whereas it acted as a transient inactivator of the enzymes produced by the two a. baumannii strains. clavulanic acid was unable to inactivate the three  beta-lactamases, whereas sulbactam behaved as an inactivator only at a high concentration (1 mm) which is difficult to achieve during antibiotic therapy. analysis of the interaction with 6-beta-iodopenicillanic acid also allowed us to  better discriminate the three beta-lactamases analyzed in the present study, which can be included in the group 1 functional class (5).

AB  == the amikacin resistance gene acc(6')-ig of acinetobacter haemolyticus bm2685 encoding an aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase was characterized. the gene was identified as a coding sequence of 438 bp corresponding to a protein with a calculated mass of 16,522 da. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that it was the fourth member of a subfamily of aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases. the resistance gene was not transferable either by conjugation to escherichia coli or to acinetobacter baumannii or by transformation into acinetobacter calcoaceticus. plasmid dna from strain bm2685 did not hybridize with an intragenic aac(6')-ig probe. these results suggest a chromosomal location for this gene. the gene was detected by dna hybridization in all 20 strains of a. haemolyticus tested but not in 179 other acinetobacter strains, including a. baumannii, a. lwoffii, a. junii, and a. johnsonii and genospecies 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of which 162 were amikacin resistant. the probe did not hybridize in dot blot assays with dnas purified from members of the families enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae that encode 6'-n-acetyltransferases. these data suggest that the aac(6')-ig gene is species specific and may be used to identify a. haemolyticus.

AB  == a study of d-glucose oxidation by acinetobacter species was carried out. glucose-oxidizing strains were found distributed among almost all acinetobacter species. 14c-glucose oxidation kinetics by non-proliferating cells with separation of oxidation products (14c-gluconate) by deae-cellulose paper chromatography was studied. inhibition of glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) activity by 11 carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharides) and determination of the kinetic parameters showed that glucose oxidation was due to the action of membrane-bound  gdh (inactive in vivo on disaccharides). on the basis of gdh inhibition patterns  obtained, two groups were individualized. the first group of strains (identified  as a. calcoaceticus, a. baumannii, a. lwoffii, a. johnsonii and acinetobacter species 3, 9, 10 and 11) showed a greater affinity for glucose than the second group (a. haemolyticus, a. junii and acinetobacter species 6 and 12). restoration of gdh activity after addition of pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq) was studied in 187 strains previously found unable to oxidize glucose. gdh activity of 150 out of 166 strains identified as a. baumannii, a. johnsonii, a. lwoffii and acinetobacter species 11 and 12 was restored. eighteen of 21 strains identified as a. haemolyticus and acinetobacter species 6 were unable to produce acid from glucose after addition of pqq. our results confirm that the former taxonomic scheme for the genus acinetobacter (2 species differing only by glucose oxidation) is untenable and that, accordingly, identification of acinetobacter strains at the species level must be performed using more modern methods, i.e. carbon source utilization tests.

TI  == transferable amikacin resistance in acinetobacter spp. due to a new type of 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii bm2580 resistant to kanamycin and structurally related antibiotics, including amikacin, was isolated from a clinical specimen. a phosphocellulose paper-binding assay and dna annealing studies indicated that resistance to aminoglycosides in bm2580 was due to synthesis of a new type of 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. the gene conferring resistance to kanamycin-amikacin in this strain was carried by a 63-kilobase plasmid, pip1841,  self-transferable to a. baumannii, a. haemolyticus, and a. lwoffii but not to escherichia coli. the aminoglycoside resistance gene of pip1841 was cloned in e.  coli, where it was expressed.

TI  == identification and biotyping of clinical isolates of acinetobacter.
AB  == a total of 343 acinetobacter strains, most isolated from hospital patients, were  identified using a 16-test system (acid production from glucose, gelatin hydrolysis and utilization of 14 carbon sources) associated with tests for growth at 37, 41 and 44 degrees c. of 299 nosocomial isolates, 253 were identified as a. baumannii, 20 as acinetobacter genospecies 3, 8 as a. haemolyticus, 8 as a. lwoffii, 4 as a. johnsonii and 6 as other (presently) unnamed species. a biotyping system based on the utilization of levulinate, citraconate, l-phenylalanine, phenylacetate, 4-hydroxybenzoate and l-tartrate allowed recognition of 17 biotypes among 247 a. baumannii isolates. this biotyping system should be useful in epidemiological studies of acinetobacter strains.
