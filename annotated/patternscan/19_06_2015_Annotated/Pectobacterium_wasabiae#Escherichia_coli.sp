TI  == cloning, expression, and characterization of a new phytase from the phytopathogenic bacterium pectobacterium wasabiae dsmz 18074.
AB  == the soft rot bacterium pectobacterium wasabiae is an economically important pathogen of many crops. a new phytase gene, appa, was cloned from p. wasabiae by  degenerate pcr and tail-pcr. the open reading frame of appa consisted of 1,302 bp encoding 433 amino acid residues, including 27 residues of a putative signal peptide. the mature protein had a molecular mass of 45 kda and a theoretical pi of 5.5. the amino acid sequence contained the conserved active site residues rhgxrxp and hdtn of typical histidine acid phosphatases, and showed the highest identity of 48.5% to phym from pseudomonas syringae. the gene fragment encoding the mature phytase was expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3), and the purified recombinant phytase had a specific activity of 1,072+/-47 u/mg for phytate substrate. the optimum ph and temperature for the purified phytase were ph 5.0 and 50 degrees c, respectively. the km value was 0.17 mm, with a vmax of 1,714 micromol/min/mg. this is the first report of the identification and isolation of  phytase from pectobacterium.
