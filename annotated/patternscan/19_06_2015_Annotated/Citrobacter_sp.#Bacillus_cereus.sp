TI  == [analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  == the selective culture method and pcr-dgge technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system  constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. the results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. the upgma cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season  were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. five different sequences (df1-df5) were obtained through blast analysis and retrieval. the closest known origin groups were located as escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., proteus sp., klebsiella oxytoca, and burkholderia sp. respectively. the blastx comparison test showed that df1 closely related to the activities of the mycobacterium bacillus and the bacillus amyloliquefaciens, df2 functioned as a conservative potential atp binding protein, df3 related to the activities of the  bacillus cereus spore, df4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and df5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.

TI  == akara ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  == akara ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp). the akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. there was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. the critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. it may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of haccp was not contaminated. several bacterial isolates, namely; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus sp. and shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two  to nine. seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 used for fermentation of air-dried crop straws].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 in fermented crop straw. methods: total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis. all these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of sfc-2. results: (1) phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16s rdna gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacterfreundii, klebsiella terrigena and citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == identification of nif genes in n2-fixing bacterial strains isolated from rice fields along the yangtze river plain.
AB  == the aim of this research was to identify nifh and nifhdkye ' genes in twenty strains of n2-fixing heterotrophic bacteria isolated from rice fields in the yangtze river plain. southern hybridization of the total dna from each strain was performed with the klebsiella pneumoniae nifhdkye ' gene probe (6.2 kb eco ri fragment from psa30) and the azospirillum brasilense nifh gene probe (0.6 kb eco  ri-hin diii fragment from phu8). we found that eco ri fragments of total dna from aeromonas hydrophila hy2, bacillus azotoformans fd, bacillus licheniformis nch1,  nch5, wh4, bacillus brevis nc2, bacillus pumilus nc12, bacillus cereus nch2, citrobacter freundii hy5, hy9, derxia gummosa hz5, pseudomonas mendocina hz1 and  pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes wh3 were positively hybridized with both of the probes. agrobacterium radiobacter hy17, corynebacterium sp. hy12, yz and pseudomonas sp. hy11 had eco ri fragments hybridized with the k. pneumoniae nifhdkye ' gene probe. an eco ri fragment of total dna from bacillus megaterium yy4 was positively hybridized to the a. brasilense nifh gene probe. no hybridization sign was found in the total dna fragments from alcaligenes cupidus  yy6 and corynebacterium sp. nc11 hybridized with either of the gene probes. the data provide the number and size of ecori fragments of the total dna hybridized with the nif gene probes for these strains of rarely studied species, suggesting  additional evidence for n2 fixing and nif gene diversity of n2-fixing bacteria in rice fields along the yangtze river plain.
