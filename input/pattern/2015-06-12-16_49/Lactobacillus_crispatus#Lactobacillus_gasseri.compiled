TI  - Screening of Probiotic Candidates in Human Oral Bacteria for the Prevention of Dental Disease.
AB  - The oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. However, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. Nowadays, probiotics are expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. This study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. We screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects. These bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. We then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. As a result, Lactobacillus crispatus YIT 12319, Lactobacillus fermentum YIT 12320, Lactobacillus gasseri YIT 12321, and Streptococcus mitis YIT 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. These candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.
TI  - Identification of culturable vaginal Lactobacillus species among reproductive age women in Mysore, India.
AB  - A healthy vaginal environment is predominated by certain Lactobacillus species, which lead to the prevention of infections of the reproductive tract. This study examined the characteristics of cultivable Lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Between November 2011 and Sept 2013, 139 women attending a women's clinic in Mysore, India were diagnosed for BV in a cross-sectional study. BV was diagnosed using Amsel's criteria: homogeneous vaginal discharge, vaginal pH > 4.5, production of amines, and presence of 'clue' cells. Those with three or more of the characteristics were considered to have BV. Vaginal swabs were then cultured in Rogosa agar, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth. Gram-positive lactobacilli generating 600- 800bp amplicon by16 sRNA were further characterized by sequencing. Cultivable vaginal samples were obtained from 132 (94.9%) women. According to Amsel criteria, 83(62.1%) women were healthy and 49(37.1%) women had BV. Eleven different Lactobacillus species were isolated from 47 women. The common lactobacilli species found in this sample included L. crispatus (39.6%), L. gasseri (45.8%), and L. jensenii (14.6%). Lactobacilli were isolated from 39 healthy and 8 women with BV. L. gasseri was cultured from 18.8% of healthy and 6.1% of women with BV. The presence of L. reuteri was significantly associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p-value = 0.026). These results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population. Our findings showed lactobacilli species present in healthy vagina of women in India do not differ from those reported from other countries.
TI  - Comparison of detection methods for vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - Vaginal lactobacilli offer protection against microbiota imbalance and genitourinary tract infections. We compared vaginal lactobacilli in 50 Estonian women of child-bearing age applying culture-based methods, quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS). The culture-based methods found three different lactobacilli: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus gasseri. Using NGS revealed the presence of L. crispatus in 76%, Lactobacillus iners in 52%, L. jensenii in 47% and L. gasseri in 33% of the samples. According to qPCR, L. iners was present in 67% and L. crispatus in 64% of the samples. The proportions of L. crispatus revealed by qPCR and NGS were in good correlation (R=0.79, P<0.001), while that of L. iners correlated poorly (R=0.13, Pnot greater-than0.05). Good concordance for L. crispatus was also found between the results of the culture-based method and qPCR. Finally, good overlap between the results of the culture-based method and NGS was revealed: in case of a positive NGS result for L. crispatus, the same species was isolated in 95% of samples. The corresponding percentages were 82% for L. jensenii and 86% for L. gasseri. Our data indicate fairly general concordance of the three methods for detecting vaginal lactobacilli, except for L. iners. This points out the importance of standardisation of techniques, and the respective studies should involve cultures applying a medium suitable for the fastidious L. iners.
TI  - Lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health.
AB  - The human body is colonized by a vast number of microorganisms collectively referred to as the human microbiota. One of the main microbiota body sites is the female genital tract, commonly dominated by Lactobacillus spp., in approximately 70% of women. Each individual species can constitute approximately 99% of the ribotypes observed in any individual woman. The most frequently isolated species are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus iners. Residing at the port of entry of bacterial and viral pathogens, the vaginal Lactobacillus species can create a barrier against pathogen invasion since mainly products of their metabolism secreted in the cervicovaginal fluid can play an important role in the inhibition of bacterial and viral infections. Therefore, a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota appears to be a good biomarker for a healthy vaginal ecosystem. This balance can be rapidly altered during processes such as menstruation, sexual activity, pregnancy and various infections. An abnormal vaginal microbiota is characterized by an increased diversity of microbial species, leading to a condition known as bacterial vaginosis. Information on the vaginal microbiota can be gathered from the analysis of cervicovaginal fluid, by using the Nugent scoring or the Amsel's criteria, or at the molecular level by investigating the number and type of Lactobacillus species. However, when translating this to the clinical setting, it should be noted that the absence of a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota does not appear to directly imply a diseased condition or dysbiosis. Nevertheless, the widely documented beneficial role of vaginal Lactobacillus species demonstrates the potential of data on the composition and activity of lactobacilli as biomarkers for vaginal health. The substantiation and further validation of such biomarkers will allow the design of better targeted probiotic strategies.
TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - Lactobacillus gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, for growth in milk.
AB  - Lactobacillus gasseri is a widespread commensal lactic acid bacterium inhabiting  human mucosal niches and has many beneficial effects as a probiotic. However, L. gasseri is difficult to grow in milk, which hurts usability for the food industry. It had been previously reported that supplementation with yeast extract or proteose peptone, including peptides, enables L. gasseri to grow well in milk. In this study, our objective was to confirm peptide requirement of L. gasseri and evaluate efficacy of peptide release by enzymatic proteolysis on growth of L. gassei in milk. Three strains of L. gasseri did not grow well in modified DeMan, Rogosa, Sharpe broth without any nitrogen sources (MRS-N), but addition of a casein-derived peptide mixture, tryptone, promoted growth. In contrast, little effect was observed after adding casein or a casein-derived amino acid mixture, casamino acids. These results indicate that L. gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, among milk-derived nitrogen sources for growth. Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131T hardly had growth capacity in 6 kinds of milk-based media: bovine milk, human milk, skim milk, cheese whey, modified MRS-N (MRSL-N) supplemented with acid whey, and MRSL-N supplemented with casein. Moreover, treatment with digestive proteases, particularly pepsin, to release peptides made it grow well in each milk-based medium. The pepsin treatment was the most effective for growth of strain JCM 1131T in skim milk among the tested food-grade proteases such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, calf rennet, ficin, bromelain, and papain. As well as strain JCM 1131T, pepsinolysis of milk improved growth of other L. gasseri strains and some strains of enteric lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus reuteri. These results suggest that some relatives of L. gasseri also use peptides as desirable nitrogen sources, and that milk may be a good supplier of nutritious peptides to enteric lactobacilli including L. gasseri after peptic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. This is the first report showing peptide requirement of L. gasseri and efficacy of pepsinolysis on the growth of L. gasseri and its relatives in milk. This study would contribute to increasing usability of L. gasseri and its relatives as probiotics in dairy foods.
TI  - Rapid species-level identification of vaginal and oral lactobacilli using MALDI-TOF MS analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host. Specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection. The presence of Lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries. Despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods. This study evaluated rapid MALDI-TOF MS analysis of vaginal and oral Lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16S rDNA analysis. RESULTS: Both methods were used to analyze 77 vaginal and 21 oral Lactobacillus isolates. The concordance of both methods was at 96% with five samples discordantly identified. Fifteen different Lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily L. iners, L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. gasseri. In the oral samples 11 different species were identified, mostly L. salivarius, L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei. Overall, the species found belonged to six different phylogenetic groups. For several samples, MALDI-TOF MS analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification. However, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16S rDNA analysis result. CONCLUSION: MALDI-TOF MS analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level. Even though some results were ambiguous while 16S rDNA sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases. Thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Homogeneity of the vaginal microbiome at the cervix, posterior fornix, and vaginal canal in pregnant Chinese women.
AB  - The vaginal microbiome is an emerging concern in prenatal health. Because the sampling process of vaginal microbiota may pose potential risks for pregnant women, the choice of sampling site should be carefully considered. However, whether the microbial diversity is different across various sampling sites has been controversial. In the present study, three repeated swabs were collected at the cervix (C), posterior fornix (P), and vaginal canal (V) from 34 Chinese women during different pregnancy stages, and vaginal species were determined using the Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA tag sequences. The identified microbiomes were classified into four community state types (CSTs): CST I (dominated by L. crispatus), CST II (dominated by L. gasseri), CST III (dominated by L. iners), and CST IV-A (characterized by a low abundance of Lactobacillus, but with proportions of various species previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis). All individuals had consistent CST at the three sampling sites regardless of pregnancy stage and CST group. In addition, there was little heterogeneity across community structures within each individual, as determined by LEfSe, indicating high vaginal microbiome homogeneity at the three sampling sites. The present study also revealed different beta diversity during pregnancy stages. The vaginal microbiome variation among women during trimester T1 (9 +/- 2.6 weeks) is larger than that of non-pregnant women and women from other trimesters, as demonstrated by the UniFrac distance (P < 0.05). In particular, the present study is the first one that demonstrates the notably difference of vaginal microbiome of postpartum women compare to women in gestation. These results will be useful for future studies of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy.
TI  - Lactobacilli inactivate Chlamydia trachomatis through lactic acid but not H2O2.
AB  - Lactobacillus species dominate the microbiome in the lower genital tract of most  reproductive-age women. Producing lactic acid and H2O2, lactobacilli are believed to play an important role in prevention of colonization by and growth of pathogens. However, to date, there have been no reported studies characterizing how lactobacilli interact with Chlamydia trachomatis, a leading sexually transmitted bacterium. In this report, we demonstrate inactivation of C. trachomatis infectivity by culture media conditioned by Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii, known to be dominating organisms in the human vaginal microbiome. Lactobacillus still cultures produced lactic acid, leading to time- and concentration-dependent killing of C. trachomatis. Neutralization of the acidic media completely reversed chlamydia killing. Addition of lactic acid into Lactobacillus-unconditioned growth medium recapitulated the chlamydiacidal activity of conditioned media. The H2O2 concentrations in the still cultures were found to be comparable to those reported for the cervicovaginal fluid, but insufficient to inactivate chlamydiae. Aeration of Lactobacillus cultures by shaking markedly induced H2O2 production, but strongly inhibited Lactobacillus growth and lactic acid production, and thus severely affected acidification, leading to significantly reduced chlamydiacidal efficiency. These observations indicate lactobacilli inactivate chlamydiae primarily through maintaining acidity in a relatively hypoxic environment in the vaginal lumen with limited H2O2, which is consistent with the notion that women with higher vaginal pH are more prone to sexually transmitted C. trachomatis infection. In addition to lactic acid, formic acid and acetic acid also exhibited potent chlamydiacidal activities. Taken together, our findings imply that lowering the vaginal pH through engineering of the vaginal microbiome and other means will make women less susceptible to C. trachomatis infection.
TI  - The female urinary microbiome: a comparison of women with and without urgency urinary incontinence.
AB  - Bacterial DNA and live bacteria have been detected in human urine in the absence  of clinical infection, challenging the prevailing dogma that urine is normally sterile. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a poorly understood urinary condition characterized by symptoms that overlap urinary infection, including urinary urgency and increased frequency with urinary incontinence. The recent discovery of the urinary microbiome warrants investigation into whether bacteria contribute to UUI. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to classify bacterial DNA and expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) techniques to isolate live bacteria in urine collected by using a transurethral catheter from women with UUI and, in comparison, a cohort without UUI. For these cohorts, we demonstrated that the UUI and non-UUI urinary microbiomes differ by group based on both sequence and culture evidences. Compared to the non-UUI microbiome, sequencing experiments revealed that the UUI microbiome was composed of increased Gardnerella and decreased Lactobacillus. Nine genera (Actinobaculum, Actinomyces, Aerococcus, Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, Gardnerella, Oligella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were more frequently cultured from the UUI cohort. Although Lactobacillus was isolated from both cohorts, distinctions existed at the species level, with Lactobacillus gasseri detected more frequently in the UUI cohort and Lactobacillus crispatus most frequently detected in controls. Combined, these data suggest that potentially important differences exist in the urinary microbiomes of women with and without UUI, which have strong implications in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of UUI. Importance: New evidence indicates that the human urinary tract contains microbial communities; however, the role of these communities in urinary health remains to be elucidated. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is a highly prevalent yet poorly understood urinary condition characterized by urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. Given the significant overlap of UUI symptoms with those of urinary tract infections, it is possible that UUI may have a microbial component. We compared the urinary microbiomes of women affected by UUI to those of a comparison group without UUI, using both high-throughput sequencing and extended culture techniques. We identified statistically significant differences in the frequency and abundance of bacteria present. These differences suggest a potential role for the urinary microbiome in female urinary health.
TI  - Interplay between the temporal dynamics of the vaginal microbiota and human papillomavirus detection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to describe the temporal relationship between vaginal microbiota and human papillomavirus (HPV) detection. METHODS: Thirty-two reproductive-age women self-collected midvaginal swabs twice weekly for 16 weeks (937 samples). Vaginal bacterial communities were characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes and clustered into 6 community state types (CSTs). Each swab was tested for 37 HPV types. The effects of CSTs on the rate of transition between HPV-negative and HPV-positive states were assessed using continuous-time Markov models. RESULTS: Participants had an average of 29 samples, with HPV point prevalence between 58%-77%. CST was associated with changes in HPV status (P<.001). Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated CSTs had the fastest HPV remission rate, and a low Lactobacillus community with high proportions of the genera Atopobium (CST IV-B) had the slowest rate compared to L. crispatus-dominated CSTs (adjusted transition rate ratio [aTRR], 4.43, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-17.7; aTRR, 0.33, 95% CI, .12-1.19, respectively). The rate ratio of incident HPV for low Lactobacillus CST IV-A was 1.86 (95% CI, .52-6.74). CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal microbiota dominated by L. gasseri was associated with increased clearance of detectable HPV. Frequent longitudinal sampling is necessary for evaluation of the association between HPV detection and dynamic microbiota.
TI  - A simple identification method for vaginal secretions using relative quantification of Lactobacillus DNA.
AB  - In criminal investigations there are some cases in which identifying the presence of vaginal secretions provides crucial evidence in proving sexual assault. However, there are no methods for definitively identifying vaginal secretions. In the present study, we focused on Lactobacillus levels in vaginal secretions and developed a novel identification method for vaginal secretions by relative quantification based on real time PCR. We designed a Lactobacillus conserved region primer pair (LCP) by aligning 16S rRNA gene sequences from major vaginal Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus jensenii), and selected the human specific primer pair (HSP) as an endogenous control for relative quantification. As a result, the DeltaCt (DeltaCt=Ct[LCP]-Ct[HSP]) values of vaginal secretions (11 out of 12 samples) were significantly lower than those of saliva, semen and skin surface samples, and it was possible to discriminate between vaginal secretions and other body fluids. For the one remaining sample, it was confirmed that the predominant species in the microflora was not of the Lactobacillus genus. The DeltaCt values in this study were calculated when the total DNA input used from the vaginal secretions was 10pg or more. Additionally, the DeltaCt values of samples up to 6-months-old, which were kept at room temperature, remained unchanged. Thus, we concluded in this study that the simple DeltaCt method by real time PCR is a useful tool for detecting the presence of vaginal secretions.
TI  - Comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the US.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to HIV infection and shedding. We assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the United States. METHODS: Genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from 46 US women (36 HIV-infected, 10 HIV-uninfected) and 40 Rwandan women (18 HIV-infected, 22 HIV-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) Nugent scores. Species of Lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. Prevalence of genera and Lactobacillus species were compared using Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Overall the seven most prevalent genera were Lactobacillus (74%), Prevotella (56%), Gardnerella (55%), Atopobium (42%), Sneathia (37%), Megasphaera (30%), and Parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing Rwandan to US women, except for Megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). Additionally, Rwandan women had higher frequencies of Mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and Eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of Lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and Allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with US women. The prevalence of Mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in HIV-infected Rwandan women (39%), compared to HIV-infected US women (6%), HIV-uninfected Rwandan (9%) and US (10%) women. The most prevalent lactobacillus species in both Rwandan and US women was L. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by L. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), L. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), L. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and L. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: We found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and Lactobacillus species in Rwandan and US women. Further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.
TI  - Comparative functional genomics of Lactobacillus spp. reveals possible mechanisms for specialization of vaginal lactobacilli to their environment.
AB  - Lactobacilli are found in a wide variety of habitats. Four species, Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners, and L. jensenii, are common and abundant in the human vagina and absent from other habitats. These may be adapted to the vagina and possess characteristics enabling them to thrive in that environment. Furthermore, stable codominance of multiple Lactobacillus species in a single community is infrequently observed. Thus, it is possible that individual vaginal Lactobacillus species possess unique characteristics that confer to them host-specific competitive advantages. We performed comparative functional genomic analyses of representatives of 25 species of Lactobacillus, searching for habitat-specific traits in the genomes of the vaginal lactobacilli. We found that the genomes of the vaginal species were significantly smaller and had significantly lower GC content than those of the nonvaginal species. No protein families were found to be specific to the vaginal species analyzed, but some were either over- or underrepresented relative to nonvaginal species. We also found that within the vaginal species, each genome coded for species-specific protein families. Our results suggest that even though the vaginal species show no general signatures of adaptation to the vaginal environment, each species has specific and perhaps unique ways of interacting with its environment, be it the host or other microbes in the community. These findings will serve as a foundation for further exploring the role of lactobacilli in the ecological dynamics of vaginal microbial communities and their ultimate impact on host health.
TI  - The composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. We compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. RESULTS: A retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n = 22). Serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. A 16S rRNA gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. Linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. The vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of Lactobacillus vaginalis, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). Bacterial community state type (CST) IV-B or CST IV-A characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus Atopobium as well as the presence of Prevotella, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Ruminococcaceae, Parvimonas, Mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. The stability of the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women; however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively from one CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. to another CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: We report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. Differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. Lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. These results can serve as the basis to study the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - Multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the identification and quantitation of major vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacilli play a key role in promoting vaginal health. Depletion of these bacteria is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common vaginal disorder. Here we describe the development and laboratory validation of a novel single-tube multiplex TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for the identification and quantitative assessment of the four major vaginal Lactobacillus species: L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and L. iners. The assay utility was evaluated by the analysis of lactobacilli in non-cultured clinical vaginal swab specimens collected from BV patients and healthy individuals. As confirmed by the assay, L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and to a lesser extent L. gasseri, are common in the vagina of healthy women, whereas L. iners dominance is associated with BV. The major assay limitation was preferential detection of dominant Lactobacillus species in samples with mixed lactobacilli resulting in lower sensitivity for minor species. The multiplex qPCR assay described here is an advance in the detection and quantitation of the major vaginal lactobacilli, potentially facilitating the molecular diagnosis of BV and post-therapy restoration of the vaginal microflora.
TI  - Molecular detection of Lactobacillus species in the neovagina of male-to-female transsexual women.
AB  - There is a general opinion that penile skin lined neovagina of transsexual women  is not able to support the growth of lactobacilli. This study was undertaken to prove if lactobacilli strains could survive in neovagina and to characterise the most dominant Lactobacillus species. Sixty three male-to-female transsexual women without abnormal vaginal discharge, clinical signs of infection were recruited on an ongoing basis from among transsexual outpatients in an academic research institution and tertiary care centre. Neovaginal smears were taken for molecular Lactobacillus spp. profiling by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Lactobacillus species were detected from 47/63 transsexual women (75%). The 279 Lactobacillus signals detected by PCR-DGGE technique belonged to 13 different species. Lactobacilli of the L. delbrueckii group (L. gasseri, L. crispatus, L. johnsonii, L. iners, L. jensenii) were predominant. More than 90% of women harboured a combination of two or more neovaginal Lactobacillus species. In this study we report the frequent occurrence of lactobacilli from neovagina of transsexual women. Both, frequency and composition were similar to the normal lactic acid bacterial microflora in both women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women.
TI  - Association between the vaginal microbiota, menopause status, and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The vaginal microbiota helps protect the female genital tract from disease. We sought to describe the composition of the vaginal microbiota in premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women and to explore the association between the microbiota and vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). METHODS: Eighty-seven women (aged 35-60 y) were classified as premenopausal (n = 30), perimenopausal (n = 29), or postmenopausal (n = 28) according to Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop guidelines. Midvaginal bacterial community composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial communities clustered into six community state types (CSTs), of which four were dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners, or Lactobacillus jensenii, and two (CST IV-A and CST IV-B) had low relative abundance of Lactobacillus. CST IV-A was characterized by Streptococcus and Prevotella, whereas CST IV-B was characterized by Atopobium. There were significant associations between menopause stage and CST (P = 0.004) and between VVA and CST (P = 0.002). Perimenopausal women were more likely to be classified as CST IV-A or L. gasseri CST, whereas postmenopausal women were often classified as CST IV-A. CSTs dominated by L. crispatus and L. iners were more prevalent in premenopausal women. Nineteen participants had signs of mild or moderate VVA. Compared with women with no VVA, the vaginal microbiota of women with mild or moderate atrophy had 25-fold greater odds of being classified as CST IV-A versus L. crispatus CST (adjusted odds ratio, 25.89; 95% credible interval, 2.98-406.79). CONCLUSIONS: A distinct bacterial community state (CST IV-A) with a low relative abundance of Lactobacillus is associated with VVA. Future studies recruiting a larger number of women are needed to replicate the findings. This study provides an impetus for future longitudinal studies designed to manage, modulate, and restore vaginal microbiota homeostasis, which would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship with VVA and ultimately improve the treatment and prevention of atrophic vaginitis in menopause.
TI  - Body fluid identification by integrated analysis of DNA methylation and body fluid-specific microbial DNA.
AB  - Identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. Previous studies have reported that DNA methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial DNA can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. In the present study, a method for detecting bacterial DNA was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. The developed multiplex PCR was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by including amplicons for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. Using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the USP49, DACT1, and PFN3 tDMRs and by hypermethylation at L81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria, Veillonella atypica and/or Streptococcus salivarius. Additionally, vaginal fluid and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the PFN3 tDMR and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and/or Lactobacillus gasseri. Because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of DNA for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid in one PCR reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.
TI  - Development of a tiered multilocus sequence typing scheme for members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  - Members of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of purported health benefits they impart to the consumer. Many characteristics of these microorganisms are reported to be strain specific. Therefore, proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product labeling, and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production purposes. Fifty-two strains of the L. acidophilus complex (L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. gallinarum, L. gasseri, and L. johnsonii) were genotyped using two established methods and compared to a novel multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the hsp60 gene with AluI and TaqI successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species examined, but it lacked strain-level discrimination. Random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD-PCR) targeting the M13 sequence resulted in highly discriminatory profiles but lacked reproducibility. In this study, an MLST scheme was developed using the conserved housekeeping genes fusA, gpmA, gyrA, gyrB, lepA, pyrG, and recA, which identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into the six species. Analysis of the observed alleles suggests that nucleotide substitutions within five of the seven MLST loci have reached saturation, a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the L. acidophilus complex and our unconventional application of a typically intraspecies molecular typing tool. Our MLST results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a multispecies complex, with the potential for taxonomic expansion to a broader collection of Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of Iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by Lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of Iranian healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects with commercial vaginal probiotics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and BV infected women. Lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood BHI and MRS medias and genetically defined by 16s rRNA sequencing. Differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and BV infected were carried out by Ison and Hey grading protocol. Identification of Lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by Multiplex PCR. The inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on Hela (tumoral cervical cells) and HNCF-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by MTT and trypan blue assays. RESULTS: L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. iners, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy Iranian women. L. crispatus and L. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the BV infected groups. Also the cytotoxic effect of L. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: As L. crispatus and L. jensenni were significantly higher in BV infected women and the cytotoxic effect of L. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.
TI  - Influence of vaginal bacteria and D- and L-lactic acid isomers on vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer: implications for protection against upper genital tract infections.
AB  - We evaluated levels of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-8) in vaginal secretions in relation to the composition of vaginal bacterial communities and D- and L-lactic acid levels. The composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 46 women was determined by pyrosequencing the V1 to V3 region of 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacilli were dominant in 71.3% of the women, followed by Gardnerella (17.4%), Streptococcus (8.7%), and Enterococcus (2.2%). Of the lactobacillus-dominated communities, 51.5% were dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, 36.4% by Lactobacillus iners, and 6.1% each by Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus jensenii. Concentrations of L-lactic acid were slightly higher in lactobacillus-dominated vaginal samples, but most differences were not statistically significant. D-Lactic acid levels were higher in samples containing L. crispatus than in those with L. iners (P<0.0001) or Gardnerella (P=0.0002). The relative proportion of D-lactic acid in vaginal communities dominated by species of lactobacilli was in concordance with the proportions found in axenic cultures of the various species grown in vitro. Levels of L-lactic acid (P<0.0001) and the ratio of L-lactic acid to D-lactic acid (P=0.0060), but not concentrations of D-lactic acid, were also correlated with EMMPRIN concentrations. Moreover, vaginal concentrations of EMMPRIN and MMP-8 levels were highly correlated (P<0.0001). Taken together, the data suggest the relative proportion of L- to D-lactic acid isomers in the vagina may influence the extent of local EMMPRIN production and subsequent induction of MMP-8. The expression of these proteins may help determine the ability of bacteria to transverse the cervix and initiate upper genital tract infections. IMPORTANCE: A large proportion of preterm births (>50%) result from infections caused by bacteria originating in the vagina, which requires that they traverse the cervix. Factors that influence susceptibility to these infections are not well understood; however, there is evidence that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-8) is known to alter the integrity of the cervix. In this work, we show that concentrations of vaginal extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) are influenced by members of the vaginal microbial community and concentrations of D- or L-lactic acid isomers in vaginal secretions. Elevated levels of D-lactic acid and the ratio of D- to L-lactic acid influence EMMPRIN concentrations as well as MMP-8 levels. Thus, isomers of lactic acid may function as signaling molecules that alter host gene expression and influence risk of infection-related preterm birth.
TI  - [Illumina sequencing 16S rRNA tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: A total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 BV patients and 37 healthy women. BV status was assessed according to Amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using Gram-stain criteria (Nugent scores). Genomic DNA of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16S rRNA V6 hypervariable region by PCR and pyrosequencing by Illumina. BIPES, UCHIME, TSC and GAST were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. RESULTS: Lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly L. iners and L. crispatus, with a small quantity of Gardnerella, Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Escherichia and other genus. The alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 BV patients (P<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased Lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of L. iners) or even absence Lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of Gardnerella, Prevotella, Granulicatella, Anaerococcus, Parvimonas, Peptoniphilus.harei, Peptostreptococcus, and Dialister. Different from previous data, 7 BV cases showed a predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus (75% to 50%). CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal species in healthy women (mainly L. iners and L. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. Lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of BV patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species L.gasseri and L.acidophilus.
TI  - Normal and tumour cervical cells respond differently to vaginal lactobacilli, independent of pH and lactate.
AB  - Cervical cancer is a human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cancer, but most HPV infections are transient or intermittent and resolve spontaneously. Thus, other factors, such as cervical microflora, which are dominated by lactobacilli, must be involved in invasive cervical carcinoma development after HPV infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that lactobacilli have antitumour effects, and it is possible that vaginal lactobacilli prevent cervical cancer. Here we examined the proliferative and apoptotic responses of normal and tumour cervical cells to common vaginal lactobacilli components by investigating human normal fibroblast-like cervical (normal cervical) and HeLa (cervical tumour) cell responses to Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus. The effects of different lactobacilli components, such as culture supernatants, cytoplasmic extracts, cell-wall extracts and live cells, were determined by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, trypan blue staining, lactate dehydrogenase assay and colorimetric caspase-3 activity assay. Changes in caspase-3 and human chorionic gonadotropin beta (hCGbeta) expression were analysed by quantitative RT-PCR. Tumour cell growth inhibition by culture supernatants was higher than that by pH- and lactate-adjusted controls. However, the effects of the supernatants on normal cells were similar to those of lactate-adjusted controls. Apoptosis was inhibited by supernatants, which was consistent with higher hCGbeta expression since hCG inhibits apoptosis. Our study demonstrated that common vaginal lactobacilli exert cytotoxic effects on cervical tumour cells, but not on normal cells, and that this cytotoxicity is independent of pH and lactate. Our results encourage further studies on the interaction between lactobacilli and cervical cells, and administration of common vaginal lactobacilli as probiotics.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate Mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus jensenii, L. iners, L. crispatus and L. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. However, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. The present study was performed to genetically determine the identity of Lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) intermediate Mexican women. METHODS: In a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant Mexican women. The samples were classified into groups according to the Nugent score criteria proposed for detection of BV: normal (N), intermediate (I) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). We examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. RESULTS: Clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene: L. acidophilus (14/25), L. reuteri (6/25), L. casei (4/25) and L. buchneri (1/25). The remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as Enterococcus species. Within the L. acidophilus group, L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by L. jensenii and L. crispatus. L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the L. reuteri, L. casei and L. buchneri groups, respectively. ERIC profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the L. gasseri and L. fermentum species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with previous studies showing that L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. Additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant Mexican (Hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.
TI  - Faecal D/L lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  - Our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (SBS). Sixteen patients suffering from type II SBS were included in the study. They displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 Kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). These patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc group, while Clostridium and Bacteroides were under-represented. Each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. mucosae), displaying specific D and L-lactate production profiles in vitro. Of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mM of D-lactate and from 2 to 80 mM of L-lactate. The presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the Lactate-accumulator group (LA), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the Non lactate-accumulator group (NLA). The LA group had a lower plasma HCO3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mM) than the NLA group (22.8+/-4.6 mM), indicating that LA and NLA groups are clinically relevant sub-types. Two patients, belonging to the LA group and who particularly accumulated faecal D-lactate, were at risk of D-encephalopathic reactions. Furthermore, all patients of the NLA group and those accumulating preferentially L isoform in the LA group had never developed D-acidosis. The D/L faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher D-encephalopathy risk, rather than D- and L-lactate faecal concentrations per se. Testing criteria that take into account HCO3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal D/L lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying SBS patients at risk for D-encephalopathy.
TI  - Inhibition of HIV and HSV infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. METHODS: The in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle HIV-1 replication and HSV-2 plaque reduction assays. The XTT proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. The in vivo anti-HSV-1 activity was evaluated in BALB/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. RESULTS AND MAJOR CONCLUSION: DMEM culture supernatant of L. Gasseri and L. fermentum (PH 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of HIV replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. Co-culture of L. gasseri (1000 CFU/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of HIV replication. The supernatant of L. crispatus inhibited 50% of HSV replication at 4% and also co-culture of L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus and L. crispatus revokes almost all of the HSV multiplication. Culture supernatants of L. gasseri and L. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the HIV and HSV and inhibited HSV infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. Alive L. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting HSV-1 infection in vivo condition. Current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with neutralizing activity against HIV and HSV and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.
TI  - Identification and characterisation of vaginal lactobacilli from South African women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is highly prevalent in the African population, is one of the most common vaginal syndromes affecting women in their reproductive age placing them at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases including infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1. The vaginal microbiota of a healthy woman is often dominated by the species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus namely L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii and L. iners, which have been extensively studied in European populations, albeit less so in South African women. In this study, we have therefore identified the vaginal Lactobacillus species in a group of 40 African women from Soweto, a township on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: Identification was done by cultivating the lactobacilli on Rogosa agar, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) and Blood agar plates with 5% horse blood followed by sequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA. BV was diagnosed on the basis of Nugent scores. Since some of the previous studies have shown that the lack of vaginal hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) producing lactobacilli is associated with bacterial vaginosis, the Lactobacillus isolates were also characterised for their production of H2O2. RESULTS: Cultivable Lactobacillus species were identified in 19 out of 21 women without BV, in three out of five women with intermediate microbiota and in eight out of 14 women with BV. We observed that L. crispatus, L. iners, L. jensenii, L. gasseri and L. vaginalis were the predominant species. The presence of L. crispatus was associated with normal vaginal microbiota (P = 0.024). High level of H2O2 producing lactobacilli were more often isolated from women with normal microbiota than from the women with BV, although not to a statistically significant degree (P = 0.064). CONCLUSION: The vaginal Lactobacillus species isolated from the cohort of South African women are similar to those identified in European populations. In accordance with the other published studies, L. crispatus is related to a normal vaginal microbiota. Hydrogen peroxide production was not significantly associated to the BV status which could be attributed to the limited number of samples or to other antimicrobial factors that might be involved.
TI  - mRNA profiling for vaginal fluid and menstrual blood identification.
AB  - The detection and identification of human biological fluids, including vaginal secretions and menstrual blood, are highly important in forensic biology. Previous studies have proposed a few mRNA and bacterial markers for vaginal fluid detection, but they have not proven to be specific and reliable. The aim of this project was to develop, validate and evaluate a reliable, specific test for vaginal fluid identification that would combine detection of vaginal mRNAs and Lactobacilli. We have developed a hexaplex that detects HBD1 (human beta-defensin 1), MUC4 (mucin 4), menstrual blood marker MMP11 (matrix metalloproteinase 11), housekeeping gene G6PDH (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region of Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri/Lactobacillus johnsonii. We analysed the specificity of the markers and variations among women, as well as the sensitivity of the test and its ability to detect vaginal fluid in mixtures with semen and blood. This approach allows for the detection of vaginal fluid in stains that were up to 2 years old, if stored at room temperature and up to 18 years old if stored frozen. Through simultaneous analysis of 5 vaginal markers, the proposed hexaplex ensures high specificity and reliability in the detection of vaginal material.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Association between Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. Prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (CST) IV) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of Atopobium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and other taxa. We sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and Trichomonas vaginalis. METHODS: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. T. vaginalis screening was performed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA and beta-tubulin genes. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. A panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype T. vaginalis. The association between vaginal microbiota and T. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. RESULTS: T. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). Of the 11 T. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as CST-IV, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by L. iners, and 1 (9%) as L. crispatus-dominated (P = 0.05). CST-IV microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting T. vaginalis compared with women in the L. crispatus-dominated state (OR: 8.26, 95% CI: 1.07-372.65). Seven of the 11 T. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. CONCLUSION: T. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of Mycoplasma, Parvimonas, Sneathia, and other anaerobes.
TI  - Quantification of bacterial species of the vaginal microbiome in different groups of women, using nucleic acid amplification tests.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The vaginal microbiome plays an important role in urogenital health.  Quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assays for the most prevalent vaginal Lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis species G. vaginalis and A. vaginae exist, but qPCR information regarding variation over time is still very limited. We set up qPCR assays for a selection of seven species and defined the temporal variation over three menstrual cycles in a healthy Caucasian population with a normal Nugent score. We also explored differences in qPCR data between these healthy women and an 'at risk' clinic population of Caucasian, African and Asian women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV), as defined by the Nugent score. RESULTS: Temporal stability of the Lactobacillus species counts was high with L. crispatus counts of 108 copies/mL and L. vaginalis counts of 106 copies/mL. We identified 2 types of 'normal flora' and one 'BV type flora' with latent class analysis on the combined data of all women. The first group was particularly common in women with a normal Nugent score and was characterized by a high frequency of L. crispatus, L. iners, L. jensenii, and L. vaginalis and a correspondingly low frequency of L. gasseri and A. vaginae. The second group was characterized by the predominance of L. gasseri and L. vaginalis and was found most commonly in healthy Caucasian women. The third group was commonest in women with a high Nugent score but was also seen in a subset of African and Asian women with a low Nugent score and was characterized by the absence of Lactobacillus species (except for L. iners) but the presence of G. vaginalis and A. vaginae. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the quantification of specific bacteria by qPCR contributes to a better description of the non-BV vaginal microbiome, but we also demonstrated that differences in populations such as risk and ethnicity also have to be taken into account. We believe that our selection of indicator organisms represents a feasible strategy for the assessment of the vaginal microbiome and could be useful for monitoring the microbiome in safety trials of vaginal products.
TI  - Characteristics of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against Gardnerella vaginalis by Lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (BV), and to select one of the better Lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive G. vaginalis isolates. A total of 24 isolates from women with and without BV were identified as G. vaginalis. A higher frequency (P<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with BV (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). A total of 86 strains of Lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (P<0.05) in healthy women (97.5%) than in women with BV (76.7%). Lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. In vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the G. vaginalis strains isolated from women with BV and from healthy women. Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with BV. Concerning the indicator strains, G. vaginalis found in women with BV was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when Lactobacillus isolates from women with BV were used as producer strains. A high vaginal population level of G. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. A tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of G. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an L. johnsonii strain. Concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of G. vaginalis-associated BV depends in part on a simultaneous presence of Lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a G. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to this antagonism. The results could also explain why G. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.
TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - Detection of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  - To preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial DNA as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed PCR-based detection of 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from DNA extracted from body fluids and stains. As a result, 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. Bacterial genes detected in female urine might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. In addition, those of Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus gasseri and Gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. Because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in DNA samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, DNA samples prepared for the identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. In conclusion, 16S ribosomal RNA genes of L. crispatus, L. jensenii and A. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
TI  - Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal Chinese women.
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy Chinese women. Vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy Chinese women were analysed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library and species-specific PCR followed by sequencing and real-time PCR. A total of 13 different Lactobacillus species were detected. Species-specific PCR showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. Among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. In the fertile women, L. iners (82.61%), L. crispatus (70.65%) and L. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than L. jensenii (40.22%), L. acidophilus (39.13%), L. brevis (23.91%), L. plantarum (5.43%), L. johnsonii (3.26%), L. fermentum (2.17%), L. salivarius (2.17%), L. rhamnosus (1.09%), L. reuteri (1.09%) and L. paracasei (1.09%); L. delbrueckii was not detected. In the postmenopausal women, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri and L. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just a few samples. The prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific PCR. According to the semiquantitative analysis, the total Lactobacillus DNA concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. Sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by L. iners, 35% by L. crispatus, and 2% by L. gasseri. Associations between pairs of Lactobacillus species in fertile women were significant (P<0.05) between the following pairs: L. iners and L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii, L. iners and L. acidophilus, L. gasseri and L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri and L. jensenii. In conclusion, this study provided detailed information on Lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy Chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. The study also showed that the diversity of Lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. According to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific PCR and comparison against a 16S rRNA gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. These findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of bacterial communities. According to our findings regarding species associations, L. iners and L. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of other vaginal Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal lactobacilli in women after kidney transplantation.
AB  - Limited number of publications described vaginal microflora after kidney transplantation. Our PubMed search revealed only 18 publications including words "vaginal bacteria & kidney transplant" in the period of 1978-2011. The aim of this study was to characterize lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs of women after kidney transplantation, compared with healthy women. Eighteen renal transplant recipients (mean age 36.1) and 20 healthy women (mean age 36.0) were evaluated. Lactobacilli were cultured on MRS and Columbia blood agars. Biochemical identification with API 50 CHL (bioMerieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) and multiplex PCR according to Song et al. was performed. Lactobacilli were tested for production of H(2)O(2). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected antimicrobial agents were determined with E-tests (bioMerieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) and interpreted with CLSI and EUCAST criteria. No bacterial vaginosis was found among studied women. Two strains of group I were identified as Lactobacillus delbrueckii; 18 strains as Lactobacillus gasseri and 15 strains as Lactobacillus crispatus. Only 3 strains from group II were not identified by species-specific mPCR. Group IV was represented with 2 unidentified strains. Vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women represented more homogenous group compared with heterogenous renal transplant recipients. Biochemical identification of lactobacilli by API 50 CHL kits was concordant with mPCR results only in 7 cases (17.5%), all 7 strains were identified as L. crispatus. Majority (93%) of lactobacilli were H(2)O(2) producers. All isolated lactobacilli (100%) demonstrated high resistance to metronidazole (MIC > 256 mug/ml). Only 2 strains resistant to vancomycin (MICs: 32 and 256 mug/ml respectively), in the study and control group, and one to moxifloxacin (MIC = 32 mug/ml), were found. Resistance to metronidazole and vancomycin was concordant in CLSI and EUCAST (2010) criteria. Although significant differences between lactobacilli isolated from vaginas of kidney transplant and healthy women were not demonstrated, we demonstrated strains resistant to metronidazole, vancomycin and moxifloxacin in groups of examined women. Our study was performed on a small group of kidney transplant recipients and further more detailed molecular studies on a larger group of patients are required to confirm our results.
TI  - Lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. METHODS: Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. The composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. A variety of Lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. Bacterial DNA from Lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR using bacterial universal primers. The amplified 16S rDNA products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. RESULTS: Based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, Staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and Lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (P < 0.01). Detailed DGGE analysis on the composition of Lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri (L. gasseri) and Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) comprised the Lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of Lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii and L. reuteri. CONCLUSION: High-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats, especially the composition of Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Screening for lactobacilli with probiotic properties in the infant gut microbiota.
AB  - Lactobacilli are believed to be beneficial for the human hosts and are currently  being evaluated as potentially probiotic bacteria. In this study, Lactobacillus strains were isolated from infant faeces and were examined in vitro for potential probiotic properties. Faecal specimens from 63 healthy, full-term infants were collected at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. Seventy-four Lactobacillus strains were isolated and one or more different phenotypes from each infant (n = 44) were selected for further testing. The bacterial isolates were identified mainly as L. gasseri, L. crispatus, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. salivarius, L. fermentum after amplification and sequencing of 16s rRNA gene. The strains were examined for acid and bile tolerance, adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens. The great majority of the isolated lactobacilli were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. Resistance to vancomycin or bacitracin was detected to 34% of the strains. Twenty strains out of forty-four exhibited significant tolerance to bile salts. Those strains were subsequently tested for resistance to low pH conditions (pH 2 and 3). Interestingly, 85% (17 strains) of the tested lactobacilli remained unaffected at pH 3 after 3 h of incubation, 6 strains were found resistant at pH 2 after 1.5 h and only 2 strains found resistant after 3 h of incubation. Two of the strains were able to adhere to Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, two isolates fulfilled the in vitro probiotic criteria and are good candidates for further in vivo evaluation.
TI  - Strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  - We sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. iners, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Culture and qPCR results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. The vaginal-rectal prevalence of L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. iners, G. vaginalis and A. vaginae as established by culture vs. PCR was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%, 28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. Using qPCR, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of L. crispatus (p < 0.0001), L. jensenii (p < 0.0001), L. gasseri (p = 0.005), L. iners (p = 0.003) and A. vaginae (p = 0.002). In summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of Atopobium vaginae were established by means of qPCR, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.
TI  - (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  - A group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (GTG)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. Obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the CCM bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. Selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by pheS gene sequencing. In total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. The (GTG)(5)-PCR method identified Lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the Lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the Lactobacillus crispatus (18), Lactobacillus mucosae (one), and Lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. L. jensenii strains were distributed over two fingerprint clusters. The majority of samples was dominated by one (GTG)(5)-PCR type. The rep-PCR fingerprinting using the (GTG)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. This method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.
TI  - The role of acidification in the inhibition of Neisseria gonorrhoeae by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal lactobacilli protect the female genital tract by producing lactic acid, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide or a local immune response. In bacterial vaginosis, normal lactobacilli are replaced by an anaerobic flora and this may increase susceptibility to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a facultative anaerobe. Bacterial interference between vaginal lactobacilli and N. gonorrhoeae has not been studied in liquid medium under anaerobic conditions. By co-cultivating N. gonorrhoeae in the presence of lactobacilli we sought to identify the relative contributions of acidification and hydrogen peroxide production to any growth inhibition of N. gonorrhoeae. METHODS: Three strains of N. gonorrhoeae distinguishable by auxotyping were grown in the presence of high concentrations (107-108 cfu/mL) of three vaginal lactobacilli (L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii) in an anerobic liquid medium with and without 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic (MES) buffer. Fusobacterium nucleatum was used as an indicator of anaerobiosis. Bacterial counts were performed at 15, 20 and 25 h; at 25 h pH and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Growth of F. nucleatum to >108 cfu/mL at 25 h confirmed anaerobiosis. All bacteria grew in the anaerobic liquid medium and the addition of MES buffer had negligible effect on growth. L. crispatus and L. gasseri produced significant acidification and a corresponding reduction in growth of N. gonorrhoeae. This inhibition was abrogated by the addition of MES. L. jensenii produced less acidification and did not inhibit N. gonorrhoeae. Hydrogen peroxide was not detected in any experiment. CONCLUSIONS: During anaerobic growth, inhibition of N. gonorrhoeae by the vaginal lactobacilli tested was primarily due to acidification and abrogated by the presence of a buffer. There was no evidence of a specific mechanism of inhibition other than acid production under these conditions and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide was not produced. The acidification potential of vaginal lactobacilli under anaerobic conditions may be their most important characteristic conferring protection against N. gonorrhoeae infection.
TI  - Correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  - Identification of Lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. Therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. A carbohydrate fermentation test (API 50 CH) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. The kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. Using the molecular technique, L. crispatus (32.6%), L. jensenii (25%) and L. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. However, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: L. acidophilus (34.8%), L. crispatus (27.2%) and L. fermentum (13%). Although L. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by PCR. Agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. Although rates of L. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (Multiplex PCR) for the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting L. vaginalis and L. iners.
TI  - Identification of predominant culturable vaginal Lactobacillus species and associated bacteriophages from women with and without vaginal discharge syndrome in South Africa.
AB  - Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus vaginalis were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as the predominant culturable vaginal Lactobacillus species in a group of South African women, comprising 24, 22, 10, 10 and 9 %, respectively. A significant effect of vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the distribution of predominant Lactobacillus species was observed. Whilst L. crispatus isolates were almost equally distributed between individuals with and without VDS and were not significantly reduced in women with BV versus normal microflora, L. jensenii isolates were significantly reduced in women with VDS (P=0.022) and reduced in women with BV versus normal microflora (P=0.053). Unlike L. crispatus, L. jensenii isolates were also significantly reduced in women with BV-associated VDS versus women without VDS and with normal microflora (P=0.051). In addition, lysogeny was commonly observed for L. crispatus, with 77 % of isolates yielding phage particles with contractile and non-contractile tails. Only 29 % of L. jensenii isolates yielded phage particles, and these were visible as tailless or podo-like particles.
TI  - [New findings about vaginal bacterial flora].
AB  - The aim of this review is to update knowledge about the vaginal ecosystem, non-cultivation methods for bacterial identification (gene amplification), the Lactobacillus species that comprise normal vaginal flora and influence of host genetics on bacterial interactions with local innate and acquired immune defenses. A Medline (Pubmed) search from 1997-2009 for relevant articles was performed and the most informative articles were selected. Non-culture techniques (gene amplification) allow a comprehensive analysis of the vaginal ecosystem's composition. In the majority of women in the reproductive age there is a predominance of one or more species of Lactobacillus: L. crispatus, L. inners and L gasseri. However, in other apparently healthy women there is a deficiency or complete absence of Lactobacilli. Instead, there is a substitution by other lactic acid-producing bacteria: Atobium, Megasphaera and/or Leptotrichia species. The infectivity and/or proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina is suppressed by lactic acid production, by products of endogenous bacteria and by activation of local innate and acquired immunity. Vaginal epithelial cells produce several compounds with anti-microbial activity. These cells have Toll-like receptors on their membrane that recognize molecular patterns associated with pathogens. Recognition leads to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulation of antigen-specific immunity. The production of IgG and IgA antibodies is also triggered in the endocervix and vagina in response to infection. Vaginal flora composition and the immune mechanisms constitute important defenses. Criteria of normal and abnormal flora have to be reviewed and genetic polymorphism can explain variations in flora composition. This new knowledge should be included in the clinical practice of gynecologists and obstetricians to improve patients care.
TI  - Vaginal microbiome of reproductive-age women.
AB  - The means by which vaginal microbiomes help prevent urogenital diseases in women  and maintain health are poorly understood. To gain insight into this, the vaginal bacterial communities of 396 asymptomatic North American women who represented four ethnic groups (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian) were sampled and the species composition characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. The communities clustered into five groups: four were dominated by Lactobacillus iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii, whereas the fifth had lower proportions of lactic acid bacteria and higher proportions of strictly anaerobic organisms, indicating that a potential key ecological function, the production of lactic acid, seems to be conserved in all communities. The proportions of each community group varied among the four ethnic groups, and these differences were statistically significant [chi(2)(10) = 36.8, P < 0.0001]. Moreover, the vaginal pH of women in different ethnic groups also differed and was higher in Hispanic (pH 5.0 +/- 0.59) and black (pH 4.7 +/- 1.04) women as compared with Asian (pH 4.4 +/- 0.59) and white (pH 4.2 +/- 0.3) women. Phylotypes with correlated relative abundances were found in all communities, and these patterns were associated with either high or low Nugent scores, which are used as a factor for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. The inherent differences within and between women in different ethnic groups strongly argues for a more refined definition of the kinds of bacterial communities normally found in healthy women and the need to appreciate differences between individuals so they can be taken into account in risk assessment and disease diagnosis.
TI  - The use of bacteria for the identification of vaginal secretions.
AB  - We have used the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region for identifying vaginal specific bacteria. Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri were detected in vaginal secretions but not in semen, blood or saliva. Our data indicated that both L. crispatus and L. gasseri were detected in vaginal secretions from women with different levels of expression of hormonal genes including pregnant, pre- and post-menopausal women, and a woman who has had a hysterectomy. Therefore, we have demonstrated that these Lactobacilli are promising new markers for the forensic identification of vaginal secretions. We have incorporated the Lactobacilli markers into a mRNA multiplex system to produce an 11-plex assay that can identify circulatory blood, menstrual blood, saliva, semen (in the presence and absence of spermatozoa) and vaginal secretions.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against Candida SPP.
AB  - Urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. The treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. In this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against Candida spp. The LAB were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis, adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four Candida species into different degrees; among them L. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. The highest amount of lactic acid was produced by L. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by L. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), L. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and L. jensenii (5.4 g/l). All isolates produced H2O2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, and L. vaginalis. Only L. agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii and L. ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial Caco-2 cells. Among the isolates evaluated, L agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii, and L. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.
TI  - Comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. Thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. This study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by quantitative culture and PCR methods. Main lactobacillus species include L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii and L. iners. METHODS: A total of 150 women attending Gynecology Outpatient Clinic of Beijing Friendship Hospital, were diagnosed as having BV because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of Amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal pH (pH > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of "clue" cells. Those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. Simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and Gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade I), intermediate (grade II), or consistent with BV (grade III). Gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using Vitek 2 Compact and PCR methods. Lactobacillus species were identified by PCR methods. Gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. RESULTS: BV was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. The majority of patients with BV had a smear assessed as grade III (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade II (9%, 4/46). The majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade I (64%, 67/104). Smears assessed as grade II were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. L. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with BV, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). L. gasseri, L. iners, and L. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of BV women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The quantities of four lactobacillus species except L. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with BV. Our results provide support for the negative association between L. iners and L. gasseri. Although L. crispatus were existent both in healthy and BV positive women's vagina, the numbers of L. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. Smears of vaginal fluid and Gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.
TI  - Biosynthesis and degradation of H2O2 by vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide production by vaginal lactobacilli represents one of the most important defense mechanisms against vaginal colonization by undesirable microorganisms. To quantify the ability of a collection of 45 vaginal Lactobacillus strains to generate H(2)O(2), we first compared three published colorimetric methods. It was found that the use of DA-64 as a substrate rendered the highest sensitivity, while tetramethyl-benzidine (TMB) maintained its linearity from nanomolar to millimolar H(2)O(2) concentrations. Generation of H(2)O(2) was found to be especially common and strong for L. jensenii strains, while it was variable among L. crispatus and L. gasseri strains. Biosynthesis of H(2)O(2) only occurred upon agitation of the cultures, but the H(2)O(2)-producing machinery was already present in them before aeration started. Calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc ions did not affect H(2)O(2) production, while Cu(2+) inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii CECT 4306, which was chosen as a model strain. Cultures with Fe(3+), hemin, and hemoglobin did not accumulate H(2)O(2). Fe(3+) activated an extracellular peroxidase that destroyed the H(2)O(2) being produced by the cultures. This protected the lactobacilli against its antimicrobial effect. The production of the enzyme appears to be constitutive, the Fe(3+) ions being a necessary cofactor of the reaction.
TI  - The vaginal bacterial communities of Japanese women resemble those of women in other racial groups.
AB  - To determine whether different racial groups shared common types of vaginal microbiota, we characterized the composition and structure of vaginal bacterial communities in asymptomatic and apparently healthy Japanese women in Tokyo, Japan, and compared them with those of White and Black women from North America. The composition of vaginal communities was compared based on community profiles of terminal restriction fragments of 16S rRNA genes and phylogenetic analysis of cloned 16S rRNA gene sequences of the numerically dominant bacterial populations. The types of vaginal communities found in Japanese women were similar to those of Black and White women. As with White and Black women, most vaginal communities were dominated by lactobacilli, and only four species of Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasseri) were commonly found. Communities dominated by multiple species of lactobacilli were common in Japanese and White women, but rare in Black women. The incidence, in Japanese women, of vaginal communities with several non-Lactobacillus species at moderately high frequencies was intermediate between Black women and White women. The limited number of community types found among women in different ethnic groups suggests that host genetic factors, including the innate and adaptive immune systems, may be more important in determining the species composition of vaginal bacterial communities than are cultural and behavioral differences.
TI  - Identification and genotyping of bacteria from paired vaginal and rectal samples  from pregnant women indicates similarity between vaginal and rectal microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The vaginal microflora is important for maintaining vaginal health and preventing infections of the reproductive tract. The rectum has been suggested as the major source for the colonisation of the vaginal econiche. METHODS: To establish whether the rectum can serve as a possible bacterial reservoir for colonisation of the vaginal econiche, we cultured vaginal and rectal specimens from pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation, identified the isolates to the species level with tRNA intergenic length polymorphism analysis (tDNA-PCR) and genotyped the isolates for those subjects from which the same species was isolated simultaneously vaginally and rectally, by RAPD-analysis.One vaginal and one rectal swab were collected from a total of each of 132 pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Swabs were cultured on Columbia CNA agar and MRS agar. For each subject 4 colonies were selected for each of both sites, i.e. 8 colonies in total. RESULTS: Among the 844 isolates that could be identified by tDNA-PCR, a total of 63 bacterial species were present, 9 (14%) only vaginally, 26 (41%) only rectally, and 28 (44%) in both vagina and rectum. A total of 121 (91.6%) of 132 vaginal samples and 51 (38.6%) of 132 rectal samples were positive for lactobacilli. L. crispatus was the most frequently isolated Lactobacillus species from the vagina (40% of the subjects were positive), followed by L. jensenii (32%), L. gasseri (30%) and L. iners (11%). L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated Lactobacillus species from the rectum (15%), followed by L. jensenii (12%), L. crispatus (11%) and L. iners (2%).A total of 47 pregnant women carried the same species vaginally and rectally. This resulted in 50 vaginal/rectal pairs of the same species, for a total of eight different species. For 34 of the 50 species pairs (68%), isolates with the same genotype were present vaginally and rectally and a high level of genotypic diversity within species per subject was also established. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that there is a certain degree of correspondence between the vaginal and rectal microflora, not only with regard to species composition but also with regard to strain identity between vaginal and rectal isolates.These results support the hypothesis that the rectal microflora serves as a reservoir for colonisation of the vaginal econiche.
TI  - Blueberry husks, rye bran and multi-strain probiotics affect the severity of colitis induced by dextran sulphate sodium.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The enteric microbiota is a pivotal factor in the development of intestinal inflammation in humans but probiotics, dietary fibres and phytochemicals can have anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of multi-strain probiotics and two conceivable prebiotics in an experimental colitis model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a fibre-free diet alone or in combination with Lactobacillus crispatus DSM 16743, L. gasseri DSM 16737 and Bifidobacterium infantis DSM 15158 and/or rye bran and blueberry husks. Colitis was induced by 5% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) given by oro-gastric tube. Colitis severity, inflammatory markers, gut-load of lactobacilli and Enterobacteriaceae, bacterial translocation and formation of carboxylic acids (CAs) were analysed. RESULTS: The disease activity index (DAI) was lower in all treatment groups. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae were reduced and correlated positively with colitis severity, while DAI was negatively correlated with several CAs, e.g. butyric acid. The addition of probiotics to blueberry husks lowered the level of caecal acetic acid and increased that of propionic acid, while rye bran in combination with probiotics increased caecal CA levels and decreased distal colonic levels. Blueberry husks with probiotics reduced the incidence of bacterial translocation to the liver, colonic levels of myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and serum interleukin-12. Acetic and butyric acids in colonic content correlated negatively to malondialdehyde. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of probiotics and blueberry husks or rye bran enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects compared with probiotics or dietary fibres alone. These combinations can be used as a preventive or therapeutic approach to dietary amelioration of intestinal inflammation.
TI  - [Prevalence and characterization of vaginal lactobacillus species in women at reproductive age without vulvovaginitis].
AB  - PURPOSE: to identify species of lactobacillus isolated from the vaginal contents  of healthy and asymptomatic women, determining the most prevalent species and characterizing them phenotypically. METHODS: lactobacillus have been isolated in selective milieu from samples of the vaginal contents of 135 women without complaints of vaginal secretion, and with negative laboratorial diagnosis of vaginal infection, followed up at an outpatient clinic. After being identified by multiplex PCR, the isolates have been submitted to RNAr 16S gene sequencing, when necessary. They have also been evaluated concerning the production of lactic acid, H2O2, bacteriocins and the ability to adhere to epithelial cells. RESULTS: eight-three lactobacillus strains were isolated and identified, L. crispatus (30.1%), L. jensenii (26.5%), L. gasseri (22.9%) e L. vaginalis (8.4%), being the prevalent species. Only 20 of those isolates did not present H2O2 production, in detectable amounts. From the 37 strains selected for the test of adhesion to the epithelial cells, 12 presented 50 to 69% of adhesion, 10 presented 70% or more, and the remaining, little or no adhesion at all. None of the tested strains produced bacteriocins. CONCLUSIONS: the lactobacillus species more prevalent in women without vulvovaginitis, isolated in selective culture milieu and identified by molecular methods were L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. gasseri. Besides the fact of being more prevalent, these strains also presented better production of H2O2, and reached lower pH values in the culture milieu.
TI  - Longitudinal analysis of the vaginal microflora in pregnancy suggests that L. crispatus promotes the stability of the normal vaginal microflora and that L. gasseri and/or L. iners are more conducive to the occurrence of abnormal vaginal microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite their antimicrobial potential, vaginal lactobacilli often fail to retain dominance, resulting in overgrowth of the vagina by other bacteria, as observed with bacterial vaginosis. It remains elusive however to what extent interindividual differences in vaginal Lactobacillus community composition determine the stability of this microflora. In a prospective cohort of pregnant women we studied the stability of the normal vaginal microflora (assessed on Gram stain) as a function of the presence of the vaginal Lactobacillus index species (determined through culture and molecular analysis with tRFLP). RESULTS: From 100 consecutive Caucasian women vaginal swabs were obtained at mean gestational ages of 8.6 (SD 1.4), 21.2 (SD 1.3), and 32.4 (SD 1.7) weeks, respectively. Based on Gram stain, 77 women had normal or Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microflora (VMF) during the first trimester, of which 18 had grade Ia (L. crispatus cell morphotypes) VMF (23.4%), 16 grade Iab (L. crispatus and other Lactobacillus cell morphotypes) VMF (20.8%), and 43 grade Ib (non-L. crispatus cell morphotypes) VMF (55.8%). Thirteen women with normal VMF at baseline, converted in the second or third trimester (16.9%) to abnormal VMF defined as VMF dominated by non-Lactobacillus bacteria. Compared to grade Ia and grade Iab VMF, grade Ib VMF were 10 times (RR = 9.49, 95% CI 1.30 - 69.40) more likely to convert from normal to abnormal VMF (p = 0.009). This was explained by the observation that normal VMF comprising L. gasseri/iners incurred a ten-fold increased risk of conversion to abnormal VMF relative to non-L. gasseri/iners VMF (RR 10.41, 95% CI 1.39-78.12, p = 0.008), whereas normal VMF comprising L. crispatus had a five-fold decreased risk of conversion to abnormal VMF relative to non-L. crispatus VMF (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.89, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The presence of different Lactobacillus species with the normal vaginal microflora is a major determinant to the stability of this microflora in pregnancy: L. crispatus promotes the stability of the normal vaginal microflora while L. gasseri and/or L. iners predispose to some extent to the occurrence of abnormal vaginal microflora.
TI  - Characterization of indigenous vaginal lactobacilli from healthy women as probiotic candidates.
AB  - The probiotic relevant characteristics of 45 strains of vaginal Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. Of these, 21 strains were classified as L. crispatus, 17 as L. jensenii, six as L. gasseri, and one as L. plantarum. The rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. None used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. H2O2 generation was common, especially among L. jensenii isolates (88%). No bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. Most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. One of these plasmids was found to be promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. All strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. Almost half of the strains were highly resistant to nonoxinol 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. Based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates.
TI  - Distribution of genital Lactobacillus strains shared by female sex partners.
AB  - The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among lesbians is high. We assessed whether unique Lactobacillus strains were shared by female sex partners. Cultures of vaginal and rectal specimens for detection of Lactobacillus organisms were performed for women who reported having had sex with women. Lactobacilli were identified on the basis of DNA homology and were typed and fingerprinted by repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR). Of 237 women, Lactobacillus crispatus was detected in 98% and Lactobacillus gasseri in 21%. Detection of L. gasseri was associated with recent receptive digital-vaginal sex (P = .04) and increased bacterial vaginosis risk (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-13.4). Of 31 couples monogamous for >3 months, rep-PCR fingerprints were identical in both members in 23 (77%).
TI  - Adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - Lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human specific pathogenic bacterium that colonises the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhoea. In this study we analysed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. We show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. Protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence while Lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. Lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. Further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. Hence, gonococci bind to colonised lactobacilli and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting in reduced bacterial colonisation. Also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. Taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.
TI  - Blueberry husks and multi-strain probiotics affect colonic fermentation in rats.
AB  - The aim was to investigate how blueberry husks and/or mixtures of probiotic strains (Lactobacillus crispatus DSM16743, L. gasseri DSM16737 and L. plantarum DSM15313 (LABmix), or Bifidobacterium infantis DSM15159 and DSM15161 (BIFmix)) affect colonic fermentation, caecal counts of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae, body weight gain, and blood concentrations of carboxylic acids (CA) and ammonia in rats. Dietary fibres in blueberry husks were fermented to 61 % in colon, and the elevated faecal excretion of fibre and protein contributed to the high faecal bulking capacity (1.3). The caecal pool of CA was higher in rats fed blueberry husks than the fibre-free control (P < 0.05), and the propionic acid proportion was higher in the distal colon than in the control group (P < 0.05). Probiotics lowered the caecal amount of CA when added to blueberry husks (P < 0.001), while the propionic acid proportion was higher with LABmix (P < 0.01) than blueberry husks only. The propionic acid and butyric acid concentrations in blood were higher in rats fed blueberry husks and probiotics than those fed blueberry husks only (P < 0.01), implying that the absorption of these acids was facilitated by the bacteria. The caecal counts of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae were lower in rats fed blueberry husks than the control diet (P < 0.05). The body weight gain was partly influenced by the caecal tissue and contents weights, and BIFmix decreased the ammonia concentration in blood (P < 0.05). We conclude that colonic fermentation is differentially affected by dietary fibre and probiotics, which may be of importance when developing foods with certain health effects.
TI  - Changes in the predominant human Lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the V1 and V3 regions 16S rRNA genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal Lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. METHODS: This study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal Lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment. The vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to Amsel and Nugent criteria. RESULTS: L. crispatus, L. gasseri and/or L. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. The flora of three women was dominated by L. delbrueckii, L. rhamnosus or L. vaginalis. One woman exhibited a dominance of L. iners. The flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by L. rhamnosus or L. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common in a normal, healthy vagina. CONCLUSION: Signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the V1 and V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal Lactobacilli and can be used to track the Lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.
TI  - [Vaginal microbiota: composition, protective role, associated pathologies, and therapeutic perspectives].
AB  - Vaginal microbiota, mainly comprised of Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii and  L. gasseri, protect the mucosa against the establishment of pathogenic microorganisms through three complementary mechanisms: a) specific adherence to the epithelium, which blocks colonization of pathogens, b) production of antimicrobial compounds, and c) co-aggregation with pathogens, which enhances their microbiocidal effect. Despite these mechanisms, vaginal microbiota are sometimes displaced by undesirable microorganisms, which is associated with the development of bacterial vaginosis, vaginitis due to Candida spp., trichomoniasis, and lower urinary tract infections. On rare occasions, lactobacilli cause disease, but exclusively in immunocompromised patients. The main conditions are bacteremia (about 50% of the cases) and endocarditis (30%). However, no genital pathology caused by lactobacilli has been reported. The mutualistic effect of lactobacilli suggests that instillation of these microorganisms might regenerate the vaginal ecosystem, thus eliminating the relapses associated with treatment of the infection.
TI  - Phase I trial of a Lactobacillus crispatus vaginal suppository for prevention of  recurrent urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We performed a phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerance of a  Lactobacillus vaginal suppository for prevention of recurrent UTI. METHODS: Premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTI were randomized to use L. crispatus CTV-05 or placebo vaginal suppositories daily for five days. RESULTS: 30 women were randomized (15 to L. crispatus CTV-05). No severe adverse events occurred. Mild to moderate vaginal discharge and genital irritation were reported by women in both study arms. Seven women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 developed pyuria without associated symptoms. Most women had high concentrations of vaginal H202-producing lactobacilli before randomization. L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri were the most common Lactobacillus species identified, with stable prevalence over time. CONCLUSIONS: L. crispatus CTV-05 can be given as a vaginal suppository with minimal sideeffects to healthy women with a history of recurrent UTI. Mild inflammation of the urinary tract was noted in some women.
TI  - Analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  - Vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on Blood and DeMan-Rogosa-Sharpe agar, PCR with group-specific primers for Lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and PCR with specific primers for V3 region in 16S rRNA-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Conventional isolation method on media detected only one lactobacillus (Lactobacillus brevis) while TTGE detected only Lactobacillus sp. DGGE detected seven Lactobacillus species; L. coleohominis, L. crispatus, L. iners, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus, L. vaginalis, and Leuconostoc lactis. L. acidophilus and L. gasseri, which are prevalent in Western women, were not detected in Korean women. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus, Leuc. lactis, L. coleohominis, and Weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of Korean women, were detected. The five most prevalent LABs in vaginal microbiota in Korean women were L. iners, Enterococcus faecalis, L. crispatus, Leuc. lactis, and W. cibaria.
TI  - Quantitative determination by real-time PCR of four vaginal Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between L. gasseri and L. iners.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. Here we applied existing real-time PCR formats for Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri and Gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for Atopobium vaginae, L. iners and L. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years. RESULTS: The 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the Ison and Hay criteria, as refined by Verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade Ia: 8 samples, grade Iab: 10, grade Ib: 13, grade I-like: 10, grade II: 11, grade III: 12 and grade IV: 7.L. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent Lactobacillus species detected. A significantly lower concentration of L. crispatus was found in grades II (p < 0.0001) and III (p = 0.002) compared to grade I. L. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade Iab than in grade Ia (p = 0.024). A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade III, with log10 median concentrations (log10 MC), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. Twenty (38.5%) of the 52 G. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for A. vaginae. In grade II we found almost no L. iners (log10 MC: 0/ml) but a high concentration of L. gasseri (log10 MC: 8.7/ml). By contrast, in grade III we found a high concentration of L. iners (log10 MC: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of L. gasseri (log10 MC: 0/ml). These results show a negative association between L. gasseri and L. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between L. gasseri and A. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In our study we found a clear negative association between L. iners and L. gasseri and between A. vaginae and L. gasseri. Our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade II is an intermediate stage between grades I and III, because L. gasseri, abundant in grade II is not predominant in grade III, whereas L. iners, abundant in grade III is present only in low numbers in grade II samples.
TI  - Association between Lactobacillus species and bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria, and bacterial vaginosis scores in pregnant Japanese women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the etiology of which is still uncertain, increases the risk of preterm birth. Recent PCR-based studies suggested that BV is associated with complex vaginal bacterial communities, including many newly recognized bacterial species in non-pregnant women. METHODS: To examine whether these bacteria are also involved in BV in pregnant Japanese women, vaginal fluid samples were taken from 132 women, classified as normal (n = 98), intermediate (n = 21), or BV (n = 13) using the Nugent gram stain criteria, and studied. DNA extracted from these samples was analyzed for bacterial sequences of any Lactobacillus, four Lactobacillus species, and four BV-related bacteria by PCR with primers for 16S ribosomal DNA including a universal Lactobacillus primer, Lactobacillus species-specific primers for L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and L. iners, and BV-related bacterium-specific primers for BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium. RESULTS: The prevalences of L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri were significantly higher, while those of BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium were significantly lower in the normal group than in the BV group. Unlike other Lactobacillus species, the prevalence of L. iners did not differ between the three groups and women with L. iners were significantly more likely to have BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium. Linear regression analysis revealed associations of BVAB2 and Megasphaera with Nugent score, and multivariate regression analyses suggested a close relationship between Eggerthella-like bacterium and BV. CONCLUSION: The BV-related bacteria, including BVAB2, Megasphaera, Leptotrichia, and Eggerthella-like bacterium, are common in the vagina of pregnant Japanese women with BV. The presence of L. iners may be correlated with vaginal colonization by these BV-related bacteria.
TI  - Vaginal Lactobacillus microbiota of healthy women in the late first trimester of  pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterise the dominant species of Lactobacillus colonising the vagina of healthy pregnant women, to examine some of their phenotypic and genotypic properties, and to gain a better understanding of the potential role of species, which might be associated with infection-free status. DESIGN: A prospective descriptive cohort study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Medical University of Vienna and Medical School, Vienna, Austria. SAMPLE: A total of 200 women in the late first trimester of pregnancy without clinical signs of vaginal infection were included in the study. Of these, 126 women were found to have a normal vaginal flora based on Gram stain. METHODS: Culture probes from those 126 women were further processed for identification of Lactobacillus species. Overall, 168 colonies from 84 women were identified as belonging to the Lactobacillus genus. Based on the combined results of microbiological methods and genus-specific, multiplex, and species-specific polymerase chain reaction, lactobacilli were recovered from 72 women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of Lactobacillus species of the vaginal flora of healthy pregnant women. RESULTS: The most frequently occurring species were Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri, followed by Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may have implications on the composition and on the use of Lactobacillus preparations for the prevention of recurrent vaginal infection.
TI  - Species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in Uganda and Korea.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. The aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance of Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, Uganda and Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in Uganda and Korea. The Lactobacillus Rogosa SL agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. After phenotypic analyses, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the BLAST program and phylogenetic tree construction. A total of 338 (128 Korean and 210 Ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and Weissella. While Lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, Lactobacillus fermentum was common only in Korean women, and Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus vaginalis only in Ugandan women. Among other lactic acid bacteria, Weissella was more common in Ugandan, and Pediococcus in Korean women. All Weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all Pediococcus strains inhibited Candida species. CONCLUSION: Although many lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the female genital tract: function and immune regulation.
AB  - The use of non-culture gene amplification techniques has improved our understanding of the composition of the vaginal bacterial ecosystem. In most healthy women in the reproductive period the predominant vaginal bacteria are one or more of the following species of Lactobacillus: L. crispatus, L. iners and L. gasseri. However, in other apparently healthy women lactobacilli may be deficient or absent, being replaced by other lactic-acid-producing bacteria: Atopobium, Megasphaera and/or Leptotrichia species. Infection and/or proliferation of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina is suppressed by lactic acid production, bacteria-generated antimicrobial products, and the local activities of the innate and cell-mediated immune systems. Vaginal epithelial cells produce a range of compounds with antimicrobial activities. These cells also possess membrane-bound Toll-like receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Recognition leads to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and antigen-specific immunity. Local production of IgG and IgA antibodies can also be initiated in the endocervix and vagina in response to infection.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia. Results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of G. vaginalis and P. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. The treatment of G. vaginalis- and P. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial HeLa cells with L. gasseri strain KS120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. The mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low pH and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the CFCSs. In addition, coculture of G. vaginalis or P. bivia with L. gasseri KS120.1 culture or KS120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto HeLa cells.
TI  - The in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide on vaginal microbial communities.
AB  - This study presents a series of experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of H2O2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. Vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for pH and Nugent score, and Lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. The main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating H2O2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added H2O2, (3) kinetics of H2O2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure H2O2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. Results showed that H2O2 was liberated especially by: Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus johnsonii and L. gasseri. Hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mM, which under intensive aeration increased even up to 1.8 mM. Microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure H2O2. Most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by Lactobacillus culture supernate producing H2O2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure H2O2. To conclude - the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli is a summation of various inhibitory mechanisms in which H2O2 plays some but not a crucial role, in addition to other substances.
TI  - Molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from Bulgarian women.
AB  - Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. The development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation. The aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal Lactobacillus isolates obtained from Bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. Twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. A combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. All vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ARDRA results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. Finally, the strains were subjected to PCR analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following species: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus plantarum. In conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ARDRA or ribotyping, followed by PCR specific primers identification at species level.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Atopobium vaginae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, Atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of BV. METHODS: Nine strains of Atopobium vaginae, four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of Lactobacillus iners and one strain each of Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the Etest. RESULTS: All nine strains of A. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). We found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2 to more than 256 microg/ml. The four G. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. All lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: Clindamycin has higher activity against G. vaginalis and A. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all A. vaginae isolates are metronidazole resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on a more limited number of strains.
TI  - Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota of women attending a reproductive health care service in Benin city, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether Lactobacillus species found in African women differ substantially to those of white decent, described in previous studies. The vaginal microbiota play an important role in female health, and when the naturally dominant lactobacilli are displaced resulting in bacterial vaginosis (BV), the host is more at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. METHODS: Vaginal samples were collected from 241 healthy, premenopausal Nigerian women, which were then Gram-stained for Nugent scoring. Microbial DNA was extracted, amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Lactobacillus primers, and processed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Lactobacillus species were identified by DNA sequencing and BLAST algorithm. RESULTS: Of the samples, 207 (85.8%) had PCR products for lactobacilli, whereas 34 (14.2%) showed absence of lactobacilli, which correlated to the BV Nugent scores. On sequencing of amplicons, 149 subjects (72%) had sequence homologies to lactobacilli. Most women (64%) were colonized by L. iners as the predominant strain, similar to previous findings in Canadian and Swedish women. L. gasseri was found in 7.3% samples, followed by L. plantarum, L. suntoryeus, L. crispatus, L. rhamnosus, and other species. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that even with geographic, racial, and other differences, the predominant vaginal Lactobacillus species is similar to species in women from Northern countries.
TI  - Comparison between Gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade I microflora and revised categorization of grade I microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using Nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on Gram stained slides of vaginal smears. Ison and Hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the Streptococcus cell type. Because in the Nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard Gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the Gram stain. To this purpose we compared Gram stain based categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific PCR for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae and with ii) tDNA-PCR for the identification of most cultivable species. RESULTS: A total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade I microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade II, 22 (4.3%) as grade III and 8 (1.6%) as grade IV, according to the criteria of Ison and Hay. Another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade I-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. We found that 52.7% of the grade I-like samples contained Bifidobacterium spp. while L. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade II specimens.Based on the presence of different Lactobacillus cell types, grade I specimens were further characterized as grade Ia (40.2%), grade Iab (14.9%) and grade Ib (44.9%). We found that this classification was supported by the finding that L. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade Ia and Iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade Ib specimens, a category in which L. gasseri and L. iners were predominant. CONCLUSION: Further refinement of Gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade I smears (Ia, Iab and Ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade I-like. A strong correlation was found between grade Ia and the presence of L. crispatus and between grade I-like and the presence of bifidobacteria. This refinement of Gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal microflora of healthy, nonpregnant women by chaperonin-60 sequence-based methods.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. STUDY DESIGN: Asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the vaginal swabs. Degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic DNA and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. Library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. Presence of Chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by Nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. Vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to Lactobacillus spp L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, and L. buchneri. Other sequences that were identified included representatives of Gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to Porphyromonas spp and Megasphaera spp and sequences identical to C psittaci. CONCLUSION: Culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that were not previously associated with vaginal flora.
TI  - [Inhibitory activity of vaginal Lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  - Growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of Candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from Lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. Unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of Lactobacillus on Candida. The aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected Lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against Candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against Candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. The majority of strains belonged to L. acidophilus: L. acidophilus sensu stricto, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. johnsonii as well as L. fermentum and L. plantarum species. Culture supernatants of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their inhibitory activity against the growth of Candida albicans and C. glabrata. The results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against C. albicans was demonstrated by L. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-H2O2 producing L. plantarum supernatants. Growth of C. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of Lactobacillus. Comparison of activity of live active cultures of Lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure H2O2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. This suggests that mixtures of Lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.
TI  - Susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  - Samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. Lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. Fifty-eight Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii spp. lactis, L. crispatus, L. plantarum, L. cellobiosus, L. jensenii, L. salivarius, L. curvatus, L. brevis and L. oris. The inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 Lactobacillus spp. and Candida albicans (AJD 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. Although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on C. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus isolates. The natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.
TI  - Anaerobic induction of adherence to laminin in Lactobacillus gasseri strains by contact with solid surface.
AB  - The effect of growth conditions on adhesion was studied in six species belonging  to Lactobacillus acidophilus homology groups. Namely, 17 strains including 6 fresh isolates of L. gasseri from human feces were assessed for their adherence to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. These extracellular matrix proteins were used as a model of damaged intestinal mucosa. When the bacteria were grown on MRS agar under anaerobic conditions, all eight L. gasseri strains and one L. johnsonii strain showed strong adhesiveness to laminin, but not when grown in static MRS broth. A similar pattern was observed in four L. gasseri strains in terms of adherence to fibronectin. No L. gasseri or L. johnsonii strains exhibited adhesion to type IV collagen under either growth condition. Adhesion of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus, and L. gallinarum was not affected by the growth conditions. Although protease treatment of L. gasseri cells abolished the adhesion, periodate oxidation of the cells increased it except in one strain. The adherence of L. gasseri cells was diminished by periodate and alpha-mannosidase treatments of immobilized laminin. The above results suggest that mannose-specific proteinaceous adhesion can be induced in L. gasseri by contact with a mucosal surface in the anaerobic intestinal lumen.
TI  - Colonization of the rectum by Lactobacillus species and decreased risk of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Lactobacilli colonizing the rectum may be a reservoir for vaginal lactobacilli. In a cross-sectional study of 531 females, vaginal and rectal colonization by lactobacilli were assessed by culture methods. A subset of isolates was identified to the species level by use of whole-chromosomal DNA probes. Lactobacillus crispatus (16%), L. jensenii (10%), and L. gasseri (10%) were the prevalent lactobacilli colonizing the rectums of 290 females. Only 13 (9%) of 147 females colonized by L. crispatus or L. jensenii vaginally and/or rectally had bacterial vaginosis (BV), compared with 12 (44%) of 27 females colonized by other H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli (P < .001). Cocolonization of the vagina and rectum by H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli was associated with the lowest prevalence of BV (5%), whereas females colonized only vaginally, only rectally, or at neither site had a successively increased risk of BV (P < .001). Lactobacillus species in the rectum may contribute to the maintenance of vaginal microflora.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis--a microbiological and immunological enigma.
AB  - The development of bacterial vaginosis (BV) among women of childbearing age and the resulting quantitative and qualitative shift from normally occurring lactobacilli in the vagina to a mixture of mainly anaerobic bacteria is a microbiological and immunological enigma that so far has precluded the formulation of a unifying generally accepted theory on the aetiology and clinical course of BV. This critical review highlights some of the more important aspects of BV research that could help in formulating new basic ideas respecting the biology of BV, not least the importance of the interleukin mediators of local inflammatory responses and the bacterial shift from the normally occurring lactobacilli species: L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, and L. iners to a mixed flora dominated by anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Hydrogen peroxide produced by Lactobacillus species as a regulatory molecule for vaginal microflora].
AB  - A total of 33 strains of Lactobacillus belonging to 9 species, isolated from vagina, were tested for production of hydrogen peroxide. We observed that the following species: L. delbrueckii, L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. johnsonii and L. gasseri dominated over other species in secretion of hydrogen peroxide to the growth medium. Concentration of this substance amounted from 0.05 to 1.06 mM (in case of strong aeration the concentration increased up to 1.8 mM). Moreover, killing properties of the pure hydrogen peroxide exerted toward Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were less prominent than these of the supernatants of cultures of Lactobacillus strains producing H2O2.
TI  - The aggregation-promoting factor of Lactobacillus crispatus M247 and its genetic  locus.
AB  - AIMS: Characterization of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) of the human intestinal isolate Lactobacillus crispatus M247 and its homologous nonaggregating mutant Mu5. METHODS AND RESULTS: Western blot analysis revealed that the supernatant of both M247 and Mu5 contains a 28-kDa protein which cross reacts with the antiserum produced against the APF of Lact. gasseri 4B2. The apf genes of M247 and Mu5 strains were identical and were shown to be 672 nucleotides in length and encoding a protein of 223 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 24.0 kDa. CONCLUSION: Our results shows that the lost of aggregation in Mu5 is not related to a defect in secretion of the APF protein or a mutation in the apf gene. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results suggest that the mutation in Mu5 may be contained in another molecule involved in aggregation such as a possible receptor for APF.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of diverse Lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  - Our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. Production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. The present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to total load of lactobacilli by real-time PCR. Pooled DNA was amplified by PCR with Lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. Specific PCR primers were designed for nine prominent species, including Lactobacillus gasseri, L. ultunensis, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, and L. gallinarum. More than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various Lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. Quantification by real-time PCR revealed various proportions of the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of L. gasseri and L. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. The findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus spp. in the context of extension of the carious lesion.
TI  - Presence of drug resistance in intestinal lactobacilli of dairy and human origin  in Turkey.
AB  - The prevalence of different resistance genes was investigated in lactobacilli of  human and dairy origin by PCR. The presence of erm, van, tet, and cat-TC genes were determined in 16 raw milk, 15 cream, 10 yogurt, 50 hand-made cheese, and 20 industrially produced white-cheese samples of dairy origin and 16 mouth, 32 fecal, and 36 vaginal samples from different subjects of human origin. Lactobacilli of dairy and human origin were found to carry only erm(B) and tet(M) genes. The majority of the isolates, Lactobacillus crispatus (61), Lactobacillus gasseri (49), Lactobacillus plantarum (80) studied were found to harbor either erm(B) or tet(M) gene or both. No resistant lactobacilli was found in raw-milk and cream samples. All the human fecal samples and the majority of vaginal (29 of 36) and mouth (10 of 14) samples were found to carry the resistance genes. While a third of the hand-made cheeses carried resistant lactobacilli only one industrially produced cheese was found to carry resistant lactobacilli. Furthermore, the genes were found in the non-starter species, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lb. plantarum, indicating that industrially produced cheeses in this respect could be considered more favorable. These results indicate that drug resistance seems to be very common in Turkey. Even though the number of dairy samples harboring the resistance genes (17 of 111) is smaller in regards to human samples, 10% of them were still found to carry the resistance genes as well. The presence of the resistance genes in majority of the samples of human origin and in minority of the samples of dairy origin indicates that drug resistance may be acquired in the intestinal tract during passage and spread to dairy products by the hands of workers during production.
TI  - Identification and H(2)O(2) production of vaginal lactobacilli from pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth and relation with outcome.
AB  - Lactobacilli, principally the strains that are hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) producing, may have a protective effect against vaginal colonization by pathogenic species such as those that cause bacterial vaginosis. Previous reports have also suggested that H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli in the vagina may protect pregnant women against ascending infection of the chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cavity. We report the identification and H(2)O(2) production of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs collected at 20 weeks' gestation from a population of pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth. We also report the correlation between identification and H(2)O(2) production in relation to the outcomes of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth. Lactobacilli were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. H(2)O(2) production by isolates was determined by a semiquantitative method. The most commonly isolated species were L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis and L. jensenii. Amounts of H(2)O(2) produced by lactobacilli varied widely. The presence of lactobacilli producing high levels of H(2)O(2) in the vagina of this population of pregnant women was associated with a reduced risk of bacterial vaginosis at 20 weeks' gestation and subsequent chorioamnionitis. L. jensenii and L. vaginalis produced the highest levels of H(2)O(2). We postulate that H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli are able to reduce the incidence of ascending infections of the uterus and the subsequent production of proinflammatory molecules which are important in the pathogenesis of chorioamnionitis and preterm birth.
TI  - Use of group-specific and RAPD-PCR analyses for rapid differentiation of Lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  - The increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. In this study, group-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR analyses were used to identify strains of the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. Group-specific PCR with primers for the L. casei and L. acidophilus groups, as well as L. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 Lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. For identification of these strains to species or strain level, RAPD profiles of the 20 Lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the L. acidophilus and L. casei group. All except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. casei, and L. paracasei. DNA reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the RAPD-PCR.
TI  - DNA fingerprinting of Lactobacillus crispatus strain CTV-05 by repetitive element sequence-based PCR analysis in a pilot study of vaginal colonization.
AB  - Lactobacillus crispatus is one of the predominant hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-producing species found in the vagina and is under development as a probiotic for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. In this study, we assessed whether DNA fingerprinting by repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) can be used to distinguish the capsule strain of L. crispatus (CTV-05) from other endogenous strains as well as other species of vaginal lactobacilli. Vaginal and rectal lactobacilli were identified to the species level by using whole-chromosome probe DNA hybridization. The DNAs from L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and an as-yet-unnamed H(2)O(2)-negative Lactobacillus species designated 1086V were subjected to rep-PCR. The results of gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining of the DNA fingerprints obtained were compared. L. crispatus CTV-05 had a unique DNA fingerprint compared to all other lactobacilli. DNA fingerprints for 27 production lots of L. crispatus sampled from 1994 through 2001 were identical to that of the original strain isolated in 1993, suggesting strain stability. In a pilot study of nine women, this DNA fingerprinting method distinguished CTV-05 from other endogenous vaginal lactobacilli prior to and after vaginal capsule use. rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting is useful for strain typing and for evaluating longitudinal loss or acquisition of vaginal lactobacilli used as probiotics.
TI  - Identification of randomly selected colonies of lactobacilli from normal vaginal  fluid by pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA variable V1 and V3 regions.
AB  - The present study aimed to characterize lactobacilli in vaginal fluid from 23 adult healthy women by using high-throughput DNA sequencing for identification of a large number of randomly selected colonies appearing on Rogosa and blood agar. The typing method was based on broad-range PCR of 16S rRNA gene variable regions V1 and V3, pyrosequencing, and classification of the fragments by alignment with NCBI-catalogued sequences and type strain sequences. Four major groups of sequences were found among the 402 isolates clearly corresponding to Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus jensenii when compared to the sequences obtained for type strains. Our results indicate that pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments as used here is a fast and reliable method well suited for identification to the species level, even within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
TI  - Susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. A study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of Lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. This is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. A selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the Etest (ABBiodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. The strains belonged to the following species: Lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. sakei, L. curvatus and species of the L. acidophilus group: L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. acidophilus. The results from the Etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. For the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. The differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. On the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) for the individual Lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacillus flora of healthy Swedish women.
AB  - Species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex are generally considered to constitute most of the vaginal Lactobacillus flora, but the flora varies between studies. However, this may be due to difficulties in identifying the closely related species within the L. acidophilus complex by using traditional methods and to variations in the vaginal status of the participants. Two hundred two isolates from the vaginal fluids of 23 Swedish women without bacterial vaginosis, as defined by the criteria of Nugent et al. (R. P. Nugent, M. A. Krohn, and S. L. Hillier, J. Clin. Microbiol. 29:297-301, 1991), were typed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and identified to the species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, multiplex PCR, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. The vaginal flora of most participants was dominated by a single RAPD type, but five of them harbored two RAPD types representing two different species or strains. The most frequently occurring species were Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus jensenii. L. iners has not previously been reported as one of the predominant Lactobacillus species in the vagina.
TI  - Molecular epidemiological study of vertical transmission of vaginal Lactobacillus species from mothers to newborn infants in Japanese, by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - We investigated mother-to-newborn infant transmission of Lactobacillus species in Japanese by the typing of isolates from the vagina of pregnant women and stool specimens from their newborn infants. All infants were born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery and were basically fed breast milk. Lactobacillus strains were fingerprinted by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), using ERIC1R and ERIC2 primers. Of 86 pregnant women tested, 71 (82.6%) were positive for vaginal lactobacilli. At 5 days after birth, 24 (33.8%) of the 71 infants whose mothers were lactobacilli-positive had fecal lactobacilli, while only 1 (6.7%) of the 15 infants delivered from the vaginal lactobacilli-negative mothers was lactobacilli-positive ( P < 0.01). Lactobacillus crispatus was the most prevalent species of vaginal lactobacilli in mothers and of fecal lactobacilli in infants at 5 days of age, whereas Lactobacillus gasseri was the most common in infants at 1 month of age. Identification to the species level, followed by AP-PCR typing, demonstrated that 23.3% of the 86 infants were likely to be colonized in the intestine by the vaginal lactobacilli of their mothers, and that only 2 of the infants retained the same vaginal lactobacilli until 1 month of age. These results suggest that approximately one-fourth of infants acquire vaginal lactobacilli from their mothers at birth, and that the acquired lactobacilli do not last in the intestine of the infant long-term, but rather, are replaced by ones from milk or unknown sources after birth. AP-PCR with primers ERIC1R and ERIC2 is indicated as a potential tool for the typing of Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-five Lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16S rRNA genes were determined and compared with existing data in GenBank. A phylogenetic tree was achieved using the Neighbour-Joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. The results showed that most vaginal isolates were L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. gasseri. Some were L. vaginalis, L. fermentum, L. mucosae, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus. Two isolates from a native American woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. Few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental Lactobacillus species. CONCLUSIONS: Most women worldwide were colonized by three common Lactobacillus species: L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. gasseri. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge of vaginal Lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus casei group and the Lactobacillus acidophilus group by automated ribotyping.
AB  - A total of 91 type and reference strains of the Lactobacillus casei group and the L acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device Riboprinter microbial characterization system. The L. casei group was divided into five (C1-C5) genotypes by ribotyping. Among them, the strain of L. casei ATCC 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of L. paracasei strains and L casei JCM 1134T generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of L. zeae. These results supported the designation of L. casei ATCC 334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of L. casei JCM 1134T as L. zeae. The L. acidophilus group was also divided into 14 (A1-A11, B1-B3) genotypes by ribotyping. L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus and L. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by L. gasseri and L. johnsonii. This result confirmed previous data that the L. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. Five strains of L. acidophilus and two strains of L. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. Most strains belonging to the L. casei group and the L. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. Thus this RiboPrinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible genetic information for the identification of many strains.
TI  - Comparative study of vaginal Lactobacillus phages isolated from women in the United States and Turkey: prevalence, morphology, host range, and DNA homology.
AB  - Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health. However, during bacterial vaginosis lactobacilli decrease for unknown reasons. Our preliminary study showed that phages could infect vaginal lactobacilli. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution, virulence, and types of vaginal Lactobacillus phages isolated from women of two countries: the United States and Turkey. A total of 209 vaginal lactobacilli were isolated from reproductive-aged women in the United States (n = 107) and Turkey (n = 102). By analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence and by comparison of protein profiles, most lactobacilli were identified as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and L. jensenii. After mitomycin C induction, 28% of American lactobacilli and 36% of Turkish lactobacilli released phages. A total of 67 phages were isolated and further characterized by their host range, electron microscopy, and DNA homology. All 67 phages were infective against lactobacilli from both collections. The host ranges of most phages were broad, including multiple Lactobacillus species. Even though the phages were all temperate, they were able to cause lytic infection in various strains. The electron micrographs of these phages showed a hexagon-shaped head and a long tail with or without a contractile tail sheath. Based on their morphology, these phages belonged to Bradley's phage groups A and B, and could be further classified into four morphotypes. All four types were found among American phages, but only three were found among Turkish isolates. DNA hybridization with labeled probes of the four types of phages revealed that additional genetic types existed within each morphotype among these phages. The phage genomic sizes ranged between 34 and 55 kb. Many of the lysogenic Lactobacillus strains released phages spontaneously at a high frequency of 10(-3) to 10(-4) PFU/cell. In conclusion, lysogeny in vaginal lactobacilli is widely spread. Some lysogenic lactobacilli spontaneously release phages with a broad host range, which can be lytic against other vaginal lactobacilli regardless of their geographic origin.
TI  - Use of the DNA sequence of variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene for rapid and accurate identification of bacteria in the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  - The Lactobacillus acidophilus complex includes Lact. acidophilus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and definitive DNA sequence-based identification system for unknown isolates of the Lact. acidophilus complex. A approximately = 500 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene, which contained the V1 and V2 variable regions, was amplified from the isolates by the polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of this region of the 16S rRNA gene from the type strains of the Lact. acidophilus complex was sufficiently variable to allow for clear differentiation amongst each of the strains. As an initial step in the characterization of potentially probiotic strains, this technique was successfully used to identify a variety of unknown human intestinal isolates. The approach described here represents a rapid and definitive method for the identification of Lact. acidophilus complex members.
TI  - Rapid identification of 11 human intestinal Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA.
AB  - Rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex PCR was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex PCR assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. Primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA gene of members of the genus Lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). The established two-step multiplex PCR assays were applied to the identification of 84 Lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the PCR results were consistent with the results from the DNA-DNA hybridization assay. These results suggest that the multiplex PCR system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common Lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.
TI  - Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov., isolated from the posterior fornix of the human vagina.
AB  - Twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gallinarum and Lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR banding patterns. Five strains grouped with the type strains of Lactobacillus gasseri (DSM 20077T) and Lactobacillus jensenii (DSM 20557T) at r > or = 0.83 in one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. However, numerical analysis of the RAPD-PCR banding patterns of representative strains selected from the L. gasseri-L. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. Four strains (TV 1010, TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045) grouped into another well separated protein profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. Strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar RAPD-PCR banding patterns and clustered at R2 > or = 0.78, separate from the other strains examined. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA of two representative strains, TV 1018T and TG 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rRNA group I Lactobacillus, which includes Lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus iners, L. jensenii, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus hamsteri, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and Lactobacillus amylolyticus. The name Lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains TV 1010 (DSM 13172), TG 1013, TV 1018T and TV 1045, with strain TV 1018T (= DSM 13171T = ATCC 700934T) as the type.
TI  - A polyphasic approach towards the identification of strains belonging to Lactobacillus acidophilus and related species.
AB  - A set of 98 strains belonging to nine species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus rRNA-group have been analysed by SDS-PAGE of cellular proteins, RAPD-PCR and AFLP with fluorescently labeled primers in order to find improved methods for their identification. Strains of the following phenotypically highly similar species were examined: L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, L. gallinarum, L. helveticus, L. iners and L. amylolyticus. Although the majority of the species can be differentiated by SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins, the latter technique showed poor discrimination between L. gasseri and L. johnsonii strains and between some strains of L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum. However, this study shows that the RAPD-PCR (using at least 3 different primers followed by numerical analysis of the combined patterns) and AFLP are most suitable genomic fingerprinting techniques for the differentiation of all the species listed above, and that databases for identification can be constructed, particularly when commercially available molecular tool-kits are used. The separate species status of the recently described L. amylolyticus and L. iners was fully confirmed.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus species of human origin by a commercial kit, API50CHL.
AB  - The efficacy of a biochemical kit, API50CHL kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results of DNA-DNA hybridization assay. The results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. Especially all strains of some species, such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as Lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. However, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. This suggests that the exact identification of Lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by API50CHL kit is difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.
TI  - The identification of vaginal Lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. Vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal DNA probes to 20 American Type Culture Collection Lactobacillus strains. Most women were colonized by L. crispatus (32%), followed by L. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated L. 1086V (15%), L. gasseri (5%), L. fermentum (0.3%), L. oris (0.3%), L. reuteri (0.3%), L. ruminis (0.3%), and L. vaginalis (0.3%). H2O2 was produced by 95% of L. crispatus and 94% of L. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of L. 1086V. Colonization by L. crispatus or L. jensenii was positively associated with being white (P<.001), age >/=20 years (P=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (P=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (P<.001) and gonorrhea (P=.03). L. crispatus and L. jensenii, not L. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.
TI  - Molecular identification of potentially probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - The rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes are useful for the identification of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, and L. amylovorus. However, the oligonucleotide probe designed for L. helveticus hybridized with nucleic acids of type strains of L. gallinarum and L. helveticus. Hence, the similarity among the 73 strains of lactobacilli was evaluated on the basis of their randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles derived from five single-primer reactions. These strains were grouped into seven clusters at a similarity level of 30%, which corresponded to six separate species of the L. acidophilus complex (L. johnsonii, L. gallinarum, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri, respectively) and L. helveticus. For the first time, strains of L. gallinarum were characterized by RAPD and PFGE analyses. The genome length in that species was estimated to be near 1.45 Mb with the summation of ApaI fragments, and near 1.95 Mb with the summation of SmaI fragments.
TI  - Acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  - Perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. During these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (pH approximately 4). This study was designed to test whether the characteristics of acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. Eight vaginal Lactobacillus isolates from four species-L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. crispatus, and L. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the Lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (pH 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (B. Andersch, L. Forssman, K. Lincoln, and P. Torstensson, Gynecol. Obstet. Investig. 21:19-25, 1986; L. Cohen, Br. J. Vener. Dis. 45:241-246, 1969; J. Paavonen, Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; C. Tevi-Benissan, L. Belec, M. Levy, V. Schneider-Fauveau, A. Si Mohamed, M.-C. Hallouin, M. Matta, and G. Gresenguet, Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). During exponential growth, all of these Lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. Such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (W. H. Masters and V. E. Johnson, Human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). During bacterial vaginosis (BV), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal pH rises to >4.5. This correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. Three BV-associated bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal pH associated with BV. Together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.
TI  - Identification of and hydrogen peroxide production by fecal and vaginal lactobacilli isolated from Japanese women and newborn infants.
AB  - We identified Lactobacillus isolates from Japanese women and newborn infants by a DNA-DNA hybridization method. The predominating lactobacilli were Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri in the women's vaginas and the newborns' intestines and L. gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum in the women's intestines. All L. crispatus strains were exclusively strong H2O2 producers.
TI  - The presence of two S-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Previously we have shown that the type strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two S-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal segment of 6 kb. The S-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent S-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. In this study the presence of S-protein and corresponding S-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to L. acidophilus was determined. All strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional SDS-PAGE whole-cellular-protein patterns. Western blot and Southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, S-proteins and S-protein-encoding genes. From these analyses we conclude that strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum possess an S-layer and contain two slp genes. Strains of L. helveticus possess an S-layer but have only one intact slp gene. Strains of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an S-layer nor S-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the L. acidophilus slpA or slpB region. The presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. amylovorus and L. gallinarum suggests that S-layer variation is a common feature for strains of these species.
TI  - Evaluation of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR as a method to differentiate Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus johnsonii.
AB  - The technique random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR was evaluated as a method to differentiate Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus johnsonii. Representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from different clusters obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. Results obtained by RAPD-PCR corresponded well with results obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. The type strains of each species displayed different RAPD profiles. Strains with identical L(+)- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent lactic dehydrogenase (nLDH) electrophoretic profiles could be distinguished on the basis of their RAPD profiles.
TI  - Hemagglutination activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The cells of 28 strains of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group were evaluated for hemagglutination (HA) activity. The activity was found in the surface layer (SL) protein fraction extracted by 2 M guanidine hydrochloride. The most SL proteins from the A group strains (L. acidophilus (A1), L. crispatus (A2), L. amylovorus (A3), and L. gallinarum (A4)) showed HA activity, but the proteins from the B group strains (L. gasseri (B1) and L. johnsonii (B2)) showed no activity. The SL proteins from the A group strains were composed in common of a main component having molecular mass of about 40-45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. The SL proteins from JCM 1034 strain that showed the highest HA activity was fractionated by CM-Toyopearl ion-exchange chromatography. The highest HA activity was detected in the major protein of 41 kDa. This protein was purified and shown to be composed of about 50% of hydrophobic amino acids. The HA activity of the protein (1034 lectin) was specifically inhibited by fetuin and bovine lactoferrin at the concentrations of 80 and 160 micrograms/ml, respectively. The removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid from fetuin significantly decreased the inhibitory activity.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  - Two-hundred and fifty Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. Data were processed by the Jaccard (SJ) and Simple Matching (SSM) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Seventeen major clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level which approximately correspond to the SSM-level of 91%. Seven clusters could be identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), Lact. buchneri (4% of patients), Lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and Lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). Unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains. Cluster 1 included the type strains of Lact. crispatus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. jensenii and Lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. agilis and Lact. casei subsp. tolerans. Clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. No obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. Most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. Exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. Cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
TI  - A Lactobacillus helveticus-Specific DNA Probe Detects Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms in This Species.
AB  - A cloned 2-kb EcoRI fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of Lactobacillus helveticus CNRZ 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total DNAs of 75 L. helveticus strains. No hybridization was found with L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, L. gasseri, or L. intestinalis strains. When Southern blots of EcoRI digests of L. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.
TI  - Systematics of the Lactobacillus population on rat intestinal mucosa with special reference to Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The systematics of the Lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (Molin et al. 1992). One-hundred-twenty-two Lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. Data were examined using Jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level: Cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. crispatus, and to some extent to L. acidophilus. Cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as L. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). Isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. The genomic homogeneity of the L. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal DNA, and the isolates could be divided into six genomic strains.
TI  - Identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  - In the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to L. acidophilus ATCC 4356. Strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, L. jensenii and L. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as L. fermentum. Moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.
