TI  == characterization of the adhesive factors of selected probiotics to caco-2 epithelium cell line.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyse the type of adhesive factors of selected probiotic strains. a large number of lactic acid bacteria with intestinal and dairy origin were collected and assessed for adhesion on caco-2 cell line. from the best adherent bacteria, four strains were selected for further research: lactobacillus gasseri g7, l. plantarum f1, l. helveticus ac and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b14. the average number of adhered bacteria was  17 per one caco-2 cell in the case of l. gasseri g7 and 21 per cell in the case of l. plantarum f1. treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), trypsin and metaperiodic acid in separate assays revealed that cell-bonded extracellular proteins were responsible for the adhesion of the selected l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. helveticus strains, in contrast to the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain, whose adhesive factors were identified as cell-bonded exopolysaccharides. the cell-wall proteins from the first three strains were isolated, fractionated and assessed for adhesion to caco-2 cells. based on the attachment properties of the purified proteins towards caco-2 cells, it was clearly proved exactly which proteins are involved in the adherence. l. plantarum f1 strain contains two adhesive proteins in contrast to the other selected strains containing one adhesive protein each. the determination of the factors mediating the adhesive abilities of the selected strains provides important information about the possible ways to preserve and increase adhesive properties towards epithelium cells.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 suppresses fatty acid release through enlargement of fat emulsion size in vitro and promotes fecal fat excretion in healthy japanese subjects.
AB  == background: lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 (lg2055) has been shown to prevent abdominal adiposity, and suppression of lipid absorption is considered a possible mechanism, detail of which, however, are poorly understood. in the present study, we evaluated the effects of lg2055 on fat hydrolysis by determining pancreatic lipase activity and fat emulsion properties in vitro. we also examined whether lg2055 influences fecal fat excretion in humans. methods: pancreatic lipase activity was investigated in vitro using an artificially prepared fat emulsion and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-muo) as substrates. the concentrations of free fatty acids and 4-methylumbelliferone were quantified. fat emulsion droplet size  was measured using a particle size analyzer. the clinical study was performed as  a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. subjects consumed 100 g of  fermented milk (fm)/d, either with or without lg2055 supplementation, for seven days. fecal samples were collected during three-day pre-observational and fm intake periods and fecal fat levels were determined. results: lg2055 dose-dependently suppressed lipase activity in the fat emulsion assay but not in  the 4-muo assay. lg2055 dose-dependently increased fat emulsion droplet size. the effects of lg2055 on lipase activity and fat emulsion properties were increased compared with four other tested strains (lactobacillus gasseri sbt0317, lactobacillus gasseri jcm1131t, lactobacillus. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus jcm1002t and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258t). in our clinical study, fecal fat level after fm intake was significantly increased compared with that observed before fm intake in the lg2055-containing active fm group but not the control fm  group lacking lg2055. conclusions: lg2055 increased fat emulsion droplet size, resulting in the suppression of lipase-mediated fat hydrolysis. the influence of  lg2055 on the physicochemical properties of fat emulsion provides a mechanism for the probiotic-mediated suppression of lipid absorption and promotion of fecal fat excretion in humans. trial registration: umin000015772.

TI  == evaluation of propidium monoazide real-time pcr for enumeration of probiotic lactobacilli microencapsulated in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate real-time pcr coupled with propidium monoazide (pma) treatment for enumeration of microencapsulated probiotic lactobacilli microencapsulated in calcium alginate beads. lactobacillus gasseri k7 (ccm 7710) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (ccm 7712) were analysed by plate counting and pma real-time pcr during storage at 4 degrees c for 90 days. pma was effective in preventing pcr amplification of the target sequences of dna released from heat-compromised bacteria. the values obtained by  real-time pcr of non-treated samples were in general higher than those obtained by real-time pcr of pma-treated samples or by plate counting, indicating the presence of sub-lethally injured cells. this study shows that plate count could not be completely replaced by culture independent method pma real-time pcr for enumeration of probiotics, but may rather complement the well-established plate counting, providing useful information about the ratio of compromised bacteria in the samples.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == molecular detection of lactobacillus species in the neovagina of male-to-female transsexual women.
AB  == there is a general opinion that penile skin lined neovagina of transsexual women  is not able to support the growth of lactobacilli. this study was undertaken to prove if lactobacilli strains could survive in neovagina and to characterise the  most dominant lactobacillus species. sixty three male-to-female transsexual women without abnormal vaginal discharge, clinical signs of infection were recruited on an ongoing basis from among transsexual outpatients in an academic research institution and tertiary care centre. neovaginal smears were taken for molecular  lactobacillus spp. profiling by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). lactobacillus species were detected from 47/63 transsexual women (75%). the 279 lactobacillus signals detected by pcr-dgge technique belonged to 13 different species. lactobacilli of the l. delbrueckii group (l. gasseri, l. crispatus, l. johnsonii, l. iners, l. jensenii) were predominant. more than 90% of women harboured a combination of two or more neovaginal lactobacillus species. in this study we report the frequent occurrence of lactobacilli from neovagina of transsexual women. both, frequency and composition were similar to the normal lactic acid bacterial microflora in both women of reproductive age and postmenopausal women.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == molecular analysis and clinical significance of lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  == lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. we determined the genotypic identification of >100 lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) cfu/ml from urine). this study assessed the clinical  significance and the frequency of occurrence of each lactobacillus sp. we identified 16 species of lactobacillus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, 10 of  which could not be associated with disease. while lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, l. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus delbrueckii were  associated with at least one infection. species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., l. rhamnosus and l. casei) were identical, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. human isolates of lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == screening of biofilm formation by beneficial vaginal lactobacilli and influence of culture media components.
AB  == aims: to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacilli to form biofilm under different culture conditions and to determine the relationship between their growth and the capability of biofilm formation by selected strains. methods and results: fifteen lactobacillus strains from human vagina were tested for biofilm  formation by crystal violet staining. only lactobacillus rhamnosus centro de referencia para lactobacilos culture collection (crl) 1332, lact. reuteri crl 1324 and lact. delbrueckii crl 1510 were able to grow and form biofilm in culture media without tween 80. however, lact. gasseri crl 1263 (a non-biofilm-forming strain) did not grow in these media. scanning electron microscopy showed that lact. rhamnosus crl 1332 and lact. reuteri crl 1324 formed a highly structured biofilm, but only lact. reuteri crl 1324 showed a high amount of extracellular material in medium without tween. conclusions: biofilm formation was significantly influenced by the strain, culture medium, inoculum concentration, microbial growth and chemical nature of the support used for the assay. significance and impacts of the study: the results allow the selection of biofilm-forming vaginal lactobacillus strains and the conditions and factors that affect this phenomenon.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == characterization of vaginal lactobacilli in women after kidney transplantation.
AB  == limited number of publications described vaginal microflora after kidney transplantation. our pubmed search revealed only 18 publications including words  "vaginal bacteria & kidney transplant" in the period of 1978-2011. the aim of this study was to characterize lactobacilli isolated from vaginal swabs of women  after kidney transplantation, compared with healthy women. eighteen renal transplant recipients (mean age 36.1) and 20 healthy women (mean age 36.0) were evaluated. lactobacilli were cultured on mrs and columbia blood agars. biochemical identification with api 50 chl (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and multiplex pcr according to song et al. was performed. lactobacilli were tested for production of h(2)o(2). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of selected antimicrobial agents were determined with e-tests (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and interpreted with clsi and eucast criteria. no bacterial vaginosis was found among studied women. two strains of group i were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii; 18 strains as lactobacillus gasseri and 15 strains  as lactobacillus crispatus. only 3 strains from group ii were not identified by species-specific mpcr. group iv was represented with 2 unidentified strains. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women represented more homogenous group compared with heterogenous renal transplant recipients. biochemical identification of lactobacilli by api 50 chl kits was concordant with mpcr results only in 7 cases (17.5%), all 7 strains were identified as l. crispatus. majority (93%) of lactobacilli were h(2)o(2) producers. all isolated lactobacilli (100%) demonstrated high resistance to metronidazole (mic > 256 mug/ml). only 2 strains resistant to vancomycin (mics: 32 and 256 mug/ml respectively), in the study and control group, and one to moxifloxacin (mic = 32 mug/ml), were found. resistance to metronidazole and vancomycin was concordant in clsi and eucast (2010) criteria. although significant differences between lactobacilli isolated from vaginas of kidney transplant and healthy women were not demonstrated, we demonstrated strains resistant to metronidazole, vancomycin and moxifloxacin in groups of examined women. our study was performed on a small group of kidney transplant recipients and further more detailed molecular studies on a larger group of patients are required to confirm our results.

TI  == effect of antioxidant activity and functional properties of chingshey purple sweet potato fermented milk by lactobacillus acidophilus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. gasseri strains.
AB  == in this study, individual selected lactic acid bacteria strains lactobacillus acidophilus (la), l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis (ldl), and l. gasseri (lga) were grown in chingshey purple sweet potato (cpsp) substrate/media. cpsp is rich in anthocyanin, which possesses antioxidant activity and in vitro cell assay. the antioxidant ability and functional properties of the fermented milk were examined. high-performance liquid chromatographic (hplc) method was used to analyze the free amino acid, organic acids, and anthocyanin content. total phenolic compounds, scavenging effects of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picyl-hydrazyl (dpph) radicals, and scavenging effects of superoxide anion radicals were determined to  evaluate the antioxidant ability of the samples. the cell proliferation of the fermented psp milk was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay. the result indicated that the antioxidant ability of the fermented cpsp milk through la, ldl, and lga strains was significantly higher than cpsp. the main anthocyanins present in the samples are  cyanidin and delphinidin. mtt assay has revealed that incubation with both psp and fermented cpsp milk prevented the cell death of macrophage-like raw264.7 cells. the potential health benefit of fermented psp milk through la, ldl, and lga strains makes the further application of cpsp in health food highly worthwhile. practical application: (1) in our study, we have employed the gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), organic acid contents, total phenol content, anthocyanins content, dpph, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, superoxide dismutase activity assay, and cytotoxicity assay to assess the functional properties of fermented cpsp milk by different lactic acid bacteria. (2) our results have revealed that the fermented cpsp milk samples possess high gaba concentrations, organic acid contents, anthocyanins contents, and antioxidant activity. this will provide potential opportunity to develop different functional food products from fermented cpsp milk. (3) the potential health benefit of fermented cpsp milk makes the further application of cpsp in health food highly worthwhile.

TI  == immunobiotic lactobacillus strains augment nlrp3 expression in newborn and adult  porcine gut-associated lymphoid tissues.
AB  == we isolated cdna encoding porcine nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor family, pryin domain containing 3 (nlrp3) from peyer's patches. the complete nucleotide open reading frame of porcine nlrp3 contains 3108-bp encoding a deduced polypeptide of 1036-amino acid residues. the porcine nlrp3 amino acid sequence is more similar to the longest isoform of human than the mouse counterpart. the predicted amino acid sequence of porcine nlrp3 presented nine c-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains. in newborn swine, the expression of nlrp3 was detected at higher levels in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, while lower levels were observed in intestinal tissues. in adult swine, nlrp3 was strongly expressed in peyer's patches and the mesenteric lymph nodes, and the expression level in the lower intestinal tissues was comparable to that in spleen. toll-like receptor and nucleotide-binding domain ligands, as well as lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus gasseri, enhanced nlrp3 expression in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (galt) of newborn and adult swine.  our results should aid in understanding the intestinal immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying nlrp3 activation and the priming ability of immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria in porcine galt.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == immunomodulation in gut-associated lymphoid tissue of neonatal chicks by immunobiotic diets.
AB  == developmental changes in immunocompetent cells of the gut during the first week posthatch were determined in broiler chicks fed immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria in the form of lactobacillus jensenii tl2937-, lactobacillus gasseri jcm1131(t)-, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus niaib6-, or l. gasseri tl2919-supplemented diets. the relative weights of spleen and bursa of fabricius  in chicks fed the immunobiotic diets were slightly higher than the control valued at 1 and 3 d of age, with the exception of spleen weight in the l. gasseri jcm1131(t) at 3 d of age, the bursa of fabricius weight in the l. gasseri jcm1131(t) at 1 and 3 d of age, and bursa of fabricius weight in the l. gasseri tl2919 group at 1 d of age. there were no significant differences in body and liver weights among the treatments. when chicks were fed the l. jensenii tl2937-  or l. gasseri tl2919-supplemented diets, expression of t cell-related mrna [cluster of differentiation 3 (cd3), interleukin-2 (il-2), and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma)] in the foregut was significantly higher than that of control chicks  at 3 or 7 d of age. expression levels of toll-like receptor (tlr) mrna tended to  increase in the foregut of chicks fed the immunobiotic diets, except for the l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus niaib6, compared with expression levels in control chicks. the bu-1 mrna expression levels in the bursa of fabricius were not affected by the supplementations with immunobiotic lactic acid bacteria. these results show that immunobiotics, particularly l. gasseri tl2919, might be useful  as immunomodulators to stimulate the gut-associated immune system in neonatal chicks, and thereby protect them from disease without decreasing growth performance as a possible substitution of antibiotics.

TI  == lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from silage.
AB  == strain firdi 006t, isolated from silage cattle feed, was characterized by using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the strain was a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium; the cells stained gram-positive and were catalase-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs phylogenetically to the genus  lactobacillus and can be placed within the lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii  group. lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii were the most closely related species, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 99.53 and 99.46% to  the respective type strains. low gyrb gene sequence similarities (<90%) and low dna-dna reassociation values (<45%) were obtained between the strain and the phylogenetically closest neighbours. based on phenotypic and genetic evidence, the strain is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is firdi 006t (=bcrc 17755t =dsm 21401t).

AB  == this study aimed at investigating the fecal microbiotas of children with celiac disease (cd) before (u-cd) and after (t-cd) they were fed a gluten-free diet and  of healthy children (hc). brothers or sisters of t-cd were enrolled as hc. each group consisted of seven children. pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis with v3 universal primers revealed a unique profile for each fecal sample. pcr-dgge analysis with group- or genus-specific 16s rrna gene primers showed that the lactobacillus community of u-cd changed significantly, while the diversity of the lactobacillus community of t-cd was quite comparable to that of hc. compared to hc, the ratio of cultivable lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium to bacteroides and enterobacteria was lower in t-cd and even lower in u-cd. the percentages of strains identified as lactobacilli differed as  follows: hc (ca. 38%) > t-cd (ca. 17%) > u-cd (ca. 10%). lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rossiae, and lactobacillus pentosus were identified only in fecal samples from t-cd and hc. lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus gasseri were identified only in several fecal samples from hc. compared to hc, the composition of bifidobacterium species of t-cd varied, and it varied even more for u-cd. forty-seven volatile organic compounds (vocs) belonging to different chemical classes were identified using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction analysis. the median concentrations varied markedly for hc, t-cd, and u-cd. overall, the r(2) values for voc data for brothers and sisters were equal to or lower than those for unrelated hc and t-cd. this study shows the effect of cd pathology on the fecal microbiotas of children.

TI  == bacteriophages of lactobacillus.
AB  == in this review, we are listing lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. our literature searches led to the identification of 231 lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the siphoviridae family, 76 to the myoviridae family, and 1 to the podoviridae family. model phages infecting lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of lactobacillus hosts. to date, nine complete lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on lactobacillus phages is bright.

TI  == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current  protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein  sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively  important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == dominant cultivable lactobacillus species from the feces of healthy adults in northern spain.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify numerically dominant cultivable lactobacilli species in the feces of healthy adults. ten individuals from asturias, northern spain, were chosen. bacterial colonies grown under anoxic conditions on mrs with cysteine were microscopically examined for lactobacilli. isolates were subsequently grouped based on the analysis of their carbohydrate fermentation profiles and then identified by partial amplification, sequencing, and comparison of their 16s rrna gene sequences. lactobacilli varied from undetectable levels in three subjects (10(5) cfu/g feces) to around 10(9) cfu/g feces. among the 71 isolates obtained from seven individuals, 12 lactobacillus species were identified. high interindividual variation was observed in terms of  total numbers, number of species, and dominant species. lactobacillus paracasei was found in four of the seven individuals; l. gasseri, l. delbrueckii, and l. plantarum in three. phenotyping showed that only one strain per species was in the majority in each individual.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == similarity and differences in the lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  == a set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. multilocus sequence analysis, dna typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. on microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of l. johnsonii. when projected on the ncc533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. a quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile dna. signatures for horizontal  gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in dna from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. on microarray hybridizations, lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence  intensities than the l. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from l. acidophilus hybridized to the l. johnsonii array. in-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of l. johnsonii with l. gasseri, l. acidophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with lactobacillus casei; and scattered x-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. the observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the l. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.

TI  == dietary deprivation of fermented foods causes a fall in innate immune response. lactic acid bacteria can counteract the immunological effect of this deprivation.
AB  == extrinsic factors such as maternal microbiota, bacterial load of the environment, diet and medication modulate the intestinal microbiota. maturation and function of the immune system is influenced by established gut microbiota. in this work we describe the immunological effects of the dietary deprivation of fermented foods  of healthy volunteers. significant decreases in faecal lactobacillus and total aerobes counts and concentration of short chain fatty acids were observed following deprivation of fermented food of the normal diet. moreover, a decrease  in phagocytic activity in leukocytes was observed after two weeks of restricted diet. therefore, the dietary deprivation of fermented foods could induce a decrease in innate immune response that might affect the capacity to respond against infections. the ingestion of a probiotic product containing the strains lactobacillus gasseri cect5714 and lactobacillus coryniformis cect5711 or a standard yogurt containing a conventional starter lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus counteracted the fall in the immune response, although the probiotic product was more effective than the standard yogurt.

TI  == the in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide on vaginal microbial communities.
AB  == this study presents a series of experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of h2o2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for ph and nugent score, and lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. the main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating h2o2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added h2o2, (3) kinetics of h2o2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure h2o2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. results showed that h2o2 was liberated especially by: lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii and l. gasseri. hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mm, which under intensive aeration increased even up to 1.8 mm. microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure h2o2. most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by lactobacillus culture supernate producing h2o2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure h2o2. to conclude - the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli is a summation of  various inhibitory mechanisms in which h2o2 plays some but not a crucial role, in addition to other substances.

AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

AB  == three prophage sequences were identified in the lactobacillus johnsoni strain ncc533. prophage lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site streptococcus thermophilus phages over its dna packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. sequence similarity linked the putative dna packaging and  head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. prophage lj965/s. thermophilus phage sfi11/lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1 on one hand and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h/lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/listeria monocytogenes phage a118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria. bacillus subtilis phage spp1 linked both sublines. the putative major head and tail proteins from lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from gram-negative bacteria. a clearly independent line of structural genes in siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site  phages including lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage d3 infecting a gram-negative bacterium. a phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the clpp-like protein identified in four cos-site siphoviridae from lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. the tree suggested that the clpp-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.

AB  == twelve strains isolated from the posterior fornix fluid of the human vagina were  identified as lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gallinarum and lactobacillus crispatus based on numerical analyses of total soluble cell protein profiles and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr banding patterns. five strains grouped with the type strains of lactobacillus gasseri (dsm 20077t) and lactobacillus jensenii (dsm 20557t) at r > or = 0.83 in  one protein profile cluster, well separated from the other species included in this study. however, numerical analysis of the rapd-pcr banding patterns of representative strains selected from the l. gasseri-l. jensenii protein cluster clearly indicated that they belong to two different species. four strains (tv 1010, tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045) grouped into another well separated protein  profile cluster at r > or = 0.87. strains selected from this cluster displayed very similar rapd-pcr banding patterns and clustered at r2 > or = 0.78, separate  from the other strains examined. sequencing of the 16s rrna of two representative strains, tv 1018t and tg 1013, of this group indicated that it represents a new member of rrna group i lactobacillus, which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type of the genus, and close relatives lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, lactobacillus iners, l. jensenii, l. crispatus, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus hamsteri, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri and lactobacillus amylolyticus. the name lactobacillus fornicalis sp. nov. is proposed for strains tv 1010 (dsm 13172), tg 1013, tv 1018t and tv 1045, with strain tv 1018t (= dsm 13171t = atcc 700934t) as the type.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of a novel lactobacillus species from human sources: description of lactobacillus iners sp. nov.
AB  == eleven strains of a hitherto undescribed gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium from human sources and medical care  products were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the phenotypic properties of the bacterium were consistent with its assignment to the genus lactobacillus but it was readily distinguished from all currently described species of this genus by its biochemical characteristics and by sds-page analysis of its cellular proteins. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the unknown bacterium was a member of rrna group i lactobacillus which includes lactobacillus delbrueckii, the type species of the genus, and close relatives. lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii were the nearest phylogenetic relatives of the unknown bacterium, but 16s rrna sequence divergence values of > 4% clearly showed that it represents a distinct species. based on both phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that  the unknown bacterium should be classified in the genus lactobacillus, as lactobacillus iners sp. nov. the type strain of lactobacillus iners is ccug 28746t.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == factors involved in adherence of lactobacilli to human caco-2 cells.
AB  == a quantitative assay performed with bacterial cells labelled with [3h]thymidine was used to investigate factors involved in the adherence of human isolates lactobacillus acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 and lactobacillus gasseri adh to human caco-2 intestinal cells. for all three strains, adherence was concentration dependent, greater at acidic ph values, and significantly greater than adherence  of a control dairy isolate, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 1489. adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 was decreased by protease treatment of the bacterial cells, whereas adherence of l. gasseri adh either was  not affected or was enhanced by protease treatment. putative surface layer proteins were identified on l. acidophilus bg2fo4 and ncfm/n2 cells but were not  involved in adherence. periodate oxidation of bacterial cell surface carbohydrates significantly reduced adherence of l. gasseri adh, moderately reduced adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4, and had no effect on adherence of l.  acidophilus ncfm/n2. these results indicate that lactobacillus species adhere to  human intestinal cells via mechanisms which involve different combinations of carbohydrate and protein factors on the bacterial cell surface. the involvement of a secreted bridging protein, which has been proposed as the primary mediator of adherence of l. acidophilus bg2fo4 in spent culture supernatant (m.-h. coconnier, t. r. klaenhammer, s. kerneis, m.-f. bernet, and a. l. servin, appl. environ. microbiol. 58:2034-2039, 1992), was not confirmed in this study. rather, a ph effect on caco-2 cells contributed significantly to the adherence of this strain in spent culture supernatant.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == a lactobacillus helveticus-specific dna probe detects restriction fragment length polymorphisms in this species.
AB  == a cloned 2-kb ecori fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total dnas of 75 l. helveticus strains. no hybridization was found with l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l.  gasseri, or l. intestinalis strains. when southern blots of ecori digests of l. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.
