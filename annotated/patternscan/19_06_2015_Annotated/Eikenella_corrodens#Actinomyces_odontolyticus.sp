TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == treatment of eikenella corrodens and actinomyces odontolyticus foot abscess in a  penicillin-allergic patient.
AB  == objective: to report a case of eikenella corrodens and actinomyces odontolyticus  foot abscess secondary to a toothpick puncture in a penicillin-allergic patient that was successfully treated with a long-term course of doxycycline. case summary: a 39-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus type 2 and hyperlipidemia presented with difficulty ambulating as well as pain and swelling of her right foot. prior to presentation, she sustained a toothpick puncture to her right foot; she removed the toothpick intact and did not know whether it had been used. due to a penicillin allergy, she began treatment with levofloxacin, which was changed to clindamycin one day later. the patient was diagnosed with right achilles tendonitis/cellulitis and was discharged on a one-week course of clindamycin. twenty-five days later she was readmitted, complaining of pain and swelling in the same area, which this time presented as an abscess. upon this admission, vancomycin and levofloxacin were initiated and incision and drainage (i & d) was performed. cultures and sensitivities from i & d were significant for e. corrodens and a. odontolyticus, and treatment was changed to intravenous doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for 10 weeks. oral doxycycline 100 mg every 12  hours was then used for 3 months, and treatment was successful. discussion: e. corrodens and a. odontolyticus are 2 slow-growing organisms that are part of the  normal oropharyngeal flora. extraoral infections due to either of these organisms may be difficult to treat and might need lengthier treatments than are necessary  for most infections. first-line treatment for such infections is penicillins and  cephalosporins; however, in a patient with penicillin allergy, treatment options  become limited, as there is potential cross-reactivity with other agents. conclusions: patients with infections secondary to e. corrodens and/or a. odontolyticus in whom penicillin allergy is a concern can be treated effectively  with doxycycline.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of althaea officinalis l. roots, arnica montana l. flowers, calendula officinalis l. flowers, hamamelis virginiana l. leaves, illicium verum hook. fruits and melissa  officinalis l. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veilonella parvula, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces odontolyticus. the methanol extracts of h. virginiana and a. montana and, to a lesser extent, a. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (mic < or = 2048 mg/l) against many of the species tested. in comparison, m. officinalis and c. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (mic > or = 2048 mg/l) against all the tested species with the exception of prevotella sp. illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against e. corrodens. the results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of h. virginiana, a. montana and a. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at  the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less  than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three  other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  == early microbial colonization of permucosal implants in edentulous patients.
AB  == in edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. samples were taken from mucosa and dentures  before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. in total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. the samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. the supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by haemophilus spp. and veillonella parvula. a group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: actinomyces odontolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena, and leptotrichia buccalis. black-pigmented bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. it is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. the presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.
