TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of Streptococcus hansenii and Peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, was determined by PCR direct sequencing. A comparative sequence analysis showed that R. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster IV of Collins et al. [M. D. Collins, P. A. Lawson, A. Willems, J. J. Cordoba, J. Fernandez-Garayzabal, P. Garcia, J. Cai, H. Hippe, and J. A. E. Farrow, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several Clostridium and Eubacterium species. R. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Streptococcus hansenii. These findings demonstrate that the genus Ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of P. productus and S. hansenii to this genus (T. Ezaki, N. Li, Y. Hashimoto, H. Miura, and H. Yamamoto, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus Ruminococcus.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Ruminococcus based on 16S rDNA sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. Ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the Gram-positive line of descent. Two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. One group contains R. flavefaciens, R. albus, R. bromii, and R. callidus. The second group constitutes R. gnavus, R. hansenii, R. lactaris, R. obeum, R. productus and R. torques which together with some Clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
