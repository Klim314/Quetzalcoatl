TI  - Antiviral activity of SPM1605 against Coxsackievirus B3.
AB  - Bifidobacteria are considered one of the most beneficial probiotics and have been widely studied for their effects against specific pathogens. The present study investigated the antiviral activity of probiotics isolated from Koreans against Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). The effect of probiotic isolates against CVB3 was measured by the plaque assay and cellular toxicity of bifidobacteria in HeLa cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Among 13 probiotic isolates, 3 Bifidobacterium adolescentis, 2 Bifidobacterium longum and 1 Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum had an antiviral effect against CVB3, while the others did not show such effect. B. adolescentis SPM1605 showed the greatest inhibitory properties against CVB3. When the threshold cycle (CT) values for the treated B. adolescentis SPM1605 samples were compared to the results for the non-treated samples, it was shown that the amplified viral sequences from the CVB3 had their copy number lowered by B. adolescentis SPM1605. Moreover, the gene expression in infected HeLa cells was also inhibited by 50%. The results suggest that B. adolescentis SPM1605 suppresses CVB3 and could be used as an alternative therapy against infectious diseases caused by coxsackieviruses.
TI  - Qualitative and Semiquantitative Analysis of Fecal Bifidobacterium Species in Centenarians Living in Bama, Guangxi, China.
AB  - Centenarians constitute a significant subpopulation in the Bama County of Guangxi province in China. The beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota, especially bifidobacteria of centenarians, have been widely accepted; however, knowledge about Bifidobacterium species in centenarians is not adequate. The aim of this study was to investigate the quantity and prevalence of fecal Bifidobacterium in healthy longevous individuals. Fecal samples from eight centenarians from Bama (aged 100 to 108 years), eight younger elderlies from Bama (aged 80 to 99 years), and eight younger elderlies from Nanning (aged 80 to 99 years) were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, species-specific clone library, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology (qPCR). A total of eight different Bifidobacterium species were detected. B. dentium, B. longum, B. thermophilum, B. pseudocatenulatum/B. catenulatum, and B. adolescentis were common in fecal of centenarians and young elderly. B. minimum, B. saecularmay/B. pullorum/B. gallinarum, and B. mongoliense were found in centenarians but were absent in the younger elderlies. In addition, Bifidobacterium species found in centenarians were different from those found in Bama young elderly and Nanning young elderly, and the principal differences were the significant increase in the population of B. longum (P < 0.05) and B. dentium (P < 0.05) and the reduction in the frequency of B. adolescentis (P < 0.05), respectively. Centenarians tend to have more complex fecal Bifidobacterium species than young elderlies from different regions.
TI  - Reduction of Phytate in Soy Drink by Fermentation with Lactobacillus casei Expressing Phytases From Bifidobacteria.
AB  - Plant-based food products can be modified by fermentation to improve flavour and  the concentration of some biologically active compounds, but also to increase the mineral availability by eliminating anti-nutrient substances such as phytates. The objective of this study was to develop a fermented soybean drink with improved nutritional quality and source of probiotic bacteria by including as starter for fermentation Lactobacillus casei strains modified to produce phytase enzymes from bifidobacteria. The L. casei strains showed a good adaptation to develop in the soy drink but they needed the addition of external carbohydrates to give rise to an efficient acidification. The strain expressing the Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum phytase was able to degrade more than 90 % phytate during product fermentation, whereas expression of Bifidobacterium longum spp. infantis phytase only led to 65 % hydrolysis. In both cases, accumulation of myo-inositol triphosphates was observed. In addition, the hydrolysis of phytate in soy drink fermented with the L. casei strain expressing the B. pseudocatenulatum phytase resulted in phytate/mineral ratios for Fe (0.35) and Zn (2.4), which were below the critical values for reduced mineral bioavailability in humans. This investigation showed the ability of modified L. casei to produce enzymes with technological relevance in the design of new functional foods.
TI  - A new insight into the physiological role of bile salt hydrolase among intestinal bacteria from the genus Bifidobacterium.
AB  - This study analyzes the occurrence of bile salt hydrolase in fourteen strains belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium. Deconjugation activity was detected using a plate test, two-step enzymatic reaction and activity staining on a native polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, bile salt hydrolases from B. pseudocatenulatum and B. longum subsp. suis were purified using a two-step chromatographic procedure. Biochemical characterization of the bile salt hydrolases showed that the purified enzymes hydrolyzed all of the six major human bile salts under the pH and temperature conditions commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. Next, the dynamic rheometry was applied to monitor the gelation process of deoxycholic acid under different conditions. The results showed that bile acids displayed aqueous media gelating properties. Finally, gel-forming abilities of bifidobacteria exhibiting bile salt hydrolase activity were analyzed. Our investigations have demonstrated that the release of deconjugated bile acids led to the gelation phenomenon of the enzymatic reaction solution containing purified BSH. The presented results suggest that bile salt hydrolase activity commonly found among intestinal microbiota increases hydrogel-forming abilities of certain bile salts. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that bile salt hydrolase activity among Bifidobacterium is directly connected with the gelation process of bile salts. In our opinion, if such a phenomenon occurs in physiological conditions of human gut, it may improve bacterial ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract and their survival in this specific ecological niche.
TI  - Inulin-type fructans modulate intestinal Bifidobacterium species populations and  decrease fecal short-chain fatty acids in obese women.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inulin-type fructans (ITF) prebiotics promote changes in the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine variations on fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentration in obese women treated with ITF and to explore associations between Bifidobacterium species, SCFA and host biological markers of metabolism. METHODS: Samples were obtained in a randomized, double blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial, with 30 obese women randomly assigned to groups that received either 16 g/day ITF (n = 15) or maltodextrin (n = 15) for 3 months. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of Bifidobacterium spp. was performed in feces by PCR-DGGE and q-PCR, and SCFA profile was analyzed by gas chromatography. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the different variables analyzed. RESULTS: The species Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were significantly increased at the end of the treatment in the prebiotic group (p < 0.01) with being B. longum negatively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin (p < 0.01). Total SCFA, acetate and propionate, that positively correlated with BMI, fasting insulinemia and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) (p < 0.05), were significantly lower in prebiotic than in placebo group after the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: ITF consumption selectively modulates Bifidobacterium spp. and decreases fecal SCFA concentration in obese women. ITF could lessen metabolic risk factors associated with higher fecal SCFA concentration in obese individuals.
TI  - Mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bifidobacterium species are one of the major components of the infant's intestine microbiota. Colonization with bifidobacteria in early infancy is suggested to be important for health in later life. However, information remains limited regarding the source of these microbes. Here, we investigated whether specific strains of bifidobacteria in the maternal intestinal flora are transmitted to their infant's intestine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy 17 mother and infant pairs (Vaginal delivery: 12; Cesarean section delivery: 5). Mother's feces were collected twice before delivery. Infant's feces were collected at 0 (meconium), 3, 7, 30, 90 days after birth. Bifidobacteria isolated from feces were genotyped by multilocus sequencing typing, and the transitions of bifidobacteria counts in infant's feces were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Stains belonging to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, were identified to be monophyletic between mother's and infant's intestine. Eleven out of 12 vaginal delivered infants carried at least one monophyletic strain. The bifidobacterial counts of the species to which the monophyletic strains belong, increased predominantly in the infant's intestine within 3 days after birth. Among infants delivered by C-section, monophyletic strains were not observed. Moreover, the bifidobacterial counts were significantly lower than the vaginal delivered infants until 7 days of age. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants born vaginally, several Bifidobacterium strains transmit from the mother and colonize the infant's intestine shortly after birth. Our data suggest that the mother's intestine is an important source for the vaginal delivered infant's intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Preliminary selection for potential probiotic Bifidobacterium isolated from subjects of different Chinese ethnic groups and evaluation of their fermentation and storage characteristics in bovine milk.
AB  - A total of 29 strains of Bifidobacterium were isolated from 18 samples of human feces in different ethnic minority regions of China. All isolates were identified as Bifidobacterium longum (9 strains) and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (20 strains) based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. These strains were preliminarily tested for their suitability to become probiotics by assessing their ability to survive adequately at low pH conditions and their tolerance of different concentrations of bile salts and simulated gastrointestinal juices. In vitro tests were sequentially used to predict the survival of these strains in the simulated conditions in the human gastrointestinal tract. These strains were first exposed to pH 2.5 for 3h, and 7 out of the 29 strains were discriminated from the others by their high survival rates. Out of these 7 strains, 4 were found to grow and survive well at an even lower pH of 2.0 and in high bile salt concentration. Apart from the gastrointestinal survival capacity, both fermentation efficiency and storage characteristics are important criteria for selecting for suitable potential probiotic strains. Therefore, the fermentation efficiency in bovine milk and the bacterial viability during the storage in the resultant fermented milk were also evaluated for these 4 selected strains. In this study, we isolated and identified 29 novel Bifidobacterium strains. Based on our initial evaluation, at least 4 of them may serve as valuable resources for further dairy probiotic strain selection.
TI  - Isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. In this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) and pepsin hydrolysate of bLF (bLFH), isolated bifidogenic peptide from bLFH, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra of bLF, bLFH, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. Against Bifidobacterium breve ATCC 15700(T), minimal effective concentrations of bLF and bLFH were 300 and 10 mug/ml. Against Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697(T), the minimal effective concentration of bLFH was 30 mug/ml, and bLF did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. As an active peptide, a heterodimer of A(1)-W(16) and L(43)-A(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. Previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. An amino acid mixture with the same composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. The strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 muM were as follows: B. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), B. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), Bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), B. longum subsp. longum (1/3), Bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), Bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), Bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and Bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). Growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by bLF at 3.75 muM. We demonstrated that bLFH showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural bLF, especially against infant-representative species, B. breve and B. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. This is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from bLF.
TI  - Long-term changes in human colonic Bifidobacterium populations induced by a 5-day oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the possible modifications due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) treatment on total bacteria and on Bifidobacterium species balance in human colonic microbiota. Eighteen healthy volunteers (19 to 36 years old) were given a 875/125 mg dose of AMC twice a day for 5 days. Fecal samples were obtained before and after antibiotic exposure. After total DNA extraction, total bacteria and bifidobacteria were specifically quantified using real-time PCR. Dominant species were monitored over time using bacterial and bifidobacterial Temporal Temperature Gradient gel Electrophoresis (TTGE). At the end of AMC exposure, total bacterial concentrations as well as bifidobacteria concentrations were significantly reduced compared to before AMC exposure:10.7+/-0.1 log(10) 16S rRNA gene copies/g vs 11.1+/-0.1 log(10) (p = 0.003) and 8.1+/-0.5 log(10) 16S rRNA gene copies/g vs 9.4+/-0.3 log(10) (p = 0.003), respectively. At the same time, the mean similarity percentages of TTGE bacteria and TTGE bifidobacteria profiles were significantly reduced compared to before AMC exposure: 51.6%+/-3.5% vs 81.4%+/-2.1% and 55.8%+/-7.6% vs 84.5%+/-4.1%, respectively. Occurrence of B. adolescentis, B. bifidum and B. pseudocatenulatum/B. catenulatum species significantly decreased. Occurrence of B. longum remained stable. Moreover, the number of distinct Bifidobacterium species per sample significantly decreased (1.5+/-0.3 vs 2.3+/-0.3; p = 0.01). Two months after AMC exposure, the mean similarity percentage of TTGE profiles was 55.6% for bacteria and 62.3% for bifidobacteria. These results clearly demonstrated that a common antibiotic treatment may qualitatively alter the colonic microbiota. Such modifications may have potential long-term physiological consequences.
TI  - Application of bifidobacterial phytases in infant cereals: effect on phytate contents and mineral dialyzability.
AB  - Phytase activity was recently described in probiotic bifidobacterial strains, opening the possibilities for their use in foods, due to the generally regarded as safe/qualified presumption of safety status of these bacteria. Two raw materials for infant cereals (multicereal and gluten-free) were examined by measuring the myo-inositol phosphates content and the in vitro Ca, Fe, and Zn availability after a dephytinization process with purified phytases from Bifidobacterium longum spp. infantis and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. Treatment with both enzymes reduced the contents of phytate as compared to control samples (untreated or treated with fungal phytase) and led to increased levels of myo-inositol triphosphate. Dephytinization followed by an in vitro model of intestinal digestion increased the solubility of Zn. However, phytase treatment did not increase significantly the mineral dialyzability as compared to untreated samples. This is the first example of the application of purified bifidobacterial phytases in food processing and shows the potential of these enzymes to be used in products for human consumption.
TI  - Viability and activity of bifidobacteria during refrigerated storage of yoghurt containing Mangifera pajang fibrous polysaccharides.
AB  - The viability and activity of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4, B. longum BB  536 and yoghurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) were studied in yoghurt containing 0.75% Mangefira pajang fibrous polysaccharides (MPFP) and inulin. Growth of probiotic organisms, their proteolytic activities, the production of short chain fatty acids (lactic, acetic and propionic) and the pH of the yoghurt samples were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C for 28 d. B. pseudocatenulatum G4 and B. longum BB 536 showed better growth and activity in the presence of MPFP and inulin, which significantly increased the production of short chain fatty acids as well as the proteolytic activity of these organisms. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This is the first study reported on produce synbiotic yoghurt as a functional food for specified health uses contains bifidobacteria and M. pajang fibrous polysaccharides. M. pajang fibrous polysaccharides can be used as a prebiotic particularly in dairy products to increase the viability and activity of bifidobacteria which can be used as probiotic to exert health benefit to the human by yoghurt that is considered common use in society; thus, the benefits of synbiotic yoghurt are readily accessible to the member of society.
TI  - Prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides preference of probiotic bifidobacteria  and antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Bifidobacterium breve 46, Bifidobacterium lactis 8:8 and Bifidobacterium longum 6:18 and three reference strains B. breve CCUG 24611, B. lactis JCM 10602, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum JCM 1200 were examined for acid and bile tolerance, prebiotic utilization and antimicrobial activity against four Clostridium difficile (CD) strains including the hypervirulent strain, PCR ribotype NAP1/027. B. lactis 8:8 and B. lactis JCM 10602 exhibited a high tolerance in MRSC broth with pH 2.5 for 30 min. B. breve 46 and B. lactis 8:8 remained 100% viable in MRSC broth with 5% porcine bile after 4 h. All six strains showed a high prebiotic degrading ability (prebiotic score) with galactooligosaccharides (GOS), isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOS) and lactulose as carbon sources and moderate degradation of fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) was metabolized to a greater extent by B. lactis 8:8, B. lactis JCM 10602, B. pseudocatenulatum JCM 1200 and B. longum 6:18 (prebiotic score >50%). All strains exhibited extracellular antimicrobial activity (AMA) against four CD strains including the CD NAP1/027. AMA of B. breve 46, B. lactis 8:8 and B. lactis JCM 10602 strains was mainly ascribed to a combined action of organic acids and heat stable, protease sensitive antimicrobial peptides when cells were grown in MRSC broth with glucose and by acids when grown with five different prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). None of C. difficile strains degraded five prebiotic-NDOs. Whole cells of B. breve 46 and B. lactis 8:8 and their supernatants inhibited the growth and toxin production of the CD NAP1/027 strain.
TI  - Hypocholesterolaemic effect of yoghurt containing Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4 or Bifidobacterium longum BB536.
AB  - The effect of a yoghurt supplement containing Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4 or Bifidobacterium longum BB536 on plasma lipids, lipid peroxidation and the faecal excretion of bile acids was examined in rats fed a cholesterol-enriched diet. After 8 weeks, the rats in the positive control (PC) group who were fed the cholesterol-enriched diet showed significant increases in plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and malondialdehyde (MDA). However, groups fed a cholesterol-enriched diet supplemented with yoghurt containing B. pseudocatenulatum G4 or B. longum BB536 had significantly lower plasma TC, LDL-C, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and MDA than had the PC group after 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, faecal excretion of bile acids was markedly increased in the rats fed the yoghurt containing B. pseudocatenulatum G4 or B. longum BB536 as compared to the PC and NC groups.
TI  - Novel phytases from Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum ATCC 27919 and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697.
AB  - Two novel phytases have been characterized from Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis. The enzymes belong to a new subclass within the histidine acid phytases, are highly specific for the hydrolysis of phytate, and render myo-inositol triphosphate as the final hydrolysis product. They represent the first phytases characterized from this group of probiotic microorganisms, opening the possibilities for their use in the processing of high-phytate-content foods.
TI  - Quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time PCR analysis targeting the groEL gene.
AB  - Quantitative real-time PCR assays targeting the groEL gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal Bifidobacterium species were developed. The housekeeping gene groEL (HSP60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. animalis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. gallicum, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. pseudolongum, and B. thermophilum. The bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groEL gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groEL copy number. Real-time PCR assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known numbers of a given Bifidobacterium species. Independent of the Bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groEL copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. The quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groEL copies/g feces. The interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different DNA extractions was less than 23%. The method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. Bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 Bifidobacterium species and B. longum frequently detected. The predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were B. breve and B. adolescentis, respectively. It was possible to distinguish B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum. We conclude that the groEL gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal Bifidobacterium species by real-time PCR.
TI  - Effects of administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis GCL2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (B. lactis) GCL2505 (GCL2505) in the intestine after administration of GCL2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. An increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. longum subsp. longum, B. adolescentis, B. anglatum, B. catenulatum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. dentium, B. longum subsp. infantis and B. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of GCL2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. However, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding B. lactis) remained unchanged. B. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. Taking into account the number of GCL2505 administered, the findings further suggested that GCL2505 proliferated in the intestine. In addition, the defecation frequency increased during GCL2505 administration compared with the placebo. Moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that GCL2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. This is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.
TI  - Changes of fecal Bifidobacterium species in adult patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease.
AB  - The beneficial effects of Bifidobacteria on health have been widely accepted. Patients with chronic liver disease have varying degrees of intestinal microflora imbalance with a decrease of total Bifidobacterial counts. Since different properties have been attributed to different Bifidobacterium species and there is no information available for the detailed changes in the genus Bifidobacterium in patients with chronic liver disease heretofore, it is meaningful to investigate the structure of this bacterium at the species level in these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease. Nested-PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), clone library, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed on the fecal samples of 16 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB patients), 16 patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV cirrhotics), and 15 healthy subjects (Controls). Though there was no significant difference in the diversity among the three groups (P = 0.196), Bifidobacterium dentium seems to be specifically enhanced in patients as the PCR-DGGE profiles showed, which was further validated by clone library and real-time quantitative PCR. In contrast to the B. dentium, Bifidobacterium catenulatum/Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were detected less frequently in the predominant profile and by quantitative PCR in HBV cirrhotics than in the controls, and the level of this species was also significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.023). Although having no quantitative difference among the three groups, Bifidobacterium longum was less commonly detected in HBV cirrhotics than in CHB patients and Controls by quantitative PCR (P = 0.011). Thus, the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium was deeply altered in CHB and HBV cirrhotic patients with a shift from beneficial species to opportunistic pathogens. The results provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease and might potentially serve as guidance for the probiotics interventions of these diseases.
TI  - Antiobesity and lipid-lowering effects of Bifidobacterium spp. in high fat diet-induced obese rats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported the preventive effects of probiotics on  obesity. Among commensal bacteria, bifidobacteria is one of the most numerous probiotics in the mammalian gut and are a type of lactic acid bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess the antiobesity and lipid-lowering effects of Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from healthy Korean on high fat diet-induced obese rats. METHODS: Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups as follows: (1) SD group, fed standard diet; (2) HFD group, fed high fat diet; and (3) HFD-LAB group, fed high fat diet supplemented with LAB supplement (B. pseudocatenulatum SPM 1204, B. longum SPM 1205, and B. longum SPM 1207; 108 ~ 109 CFU). After 7 weeks, the body, organ, and fat weights, food intake, blood serum levels, fecal LAB counts, and harmful enzyme activities were measured. RESULTS: Administration of LAB reduced body and fat weights, blood serum levels (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglyceride, glucose, leptin, AST, ALT, and lipase levels), and harmful enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and tryptophanase), and significantly increased fecal LAB counts. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Bifidobacterium spp. used in this study may have beneficial antiobesity effects.
TI  - Amoxicillin treatment modifies the composition of Bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood. However only few studies described its impact on composition of children gut microbiota, in particular on Bifidobacterium populations considered as beneficial microorganisms. In this study, the impact on faecal Bifidobacterium species of a seven-day amoxicillin treatment was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in infants during an episode of acute respiratory infection. METHODS: Faecal samples from 31 infants were obtained on day 0 (just before amoxicillin therapy) and on day 7 (the end of therapy). Total DNA was extracted and bifidobacteria were quantified using real-time PCR. Predominant Bifidobacterium species were then identified using specific PCR-TTGE. RESULTS: Bifidobacteria concentrations were not significantly altered by amoxicillin compared to the healthy group. However, amoxicillin treatment induced a complete disappearance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis species (occurrence rate of 0% versus 36.4% in healthy group, P < 0.001), a significant decrease in the occurrence rate of Bifidobacterium bifidum (23% versus 54.5% in healthy group, P < 0.05), but did not affect Bifidobacterium longum (93.5% versus 100% in healthy group) and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum/B. catenulatum (about 55% in both groups). The number of Bifidobacterium species per microbiota significantly decreased from 2.5 +/- 1 for healthy group to 1.8 +/- 0.9 for treated infants (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of Bifidobacterium. However amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.
TI  - In vitro binding of mutagenic heterocyclic aromatic amines by Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4.
AB  - Consumption of probiotics has been associated with decreased risk of colon cancer and reported to have antimutagenic/ anti-carcinogenic properties. One possible mechanism for this effect involves physical binding of the mutagenic compounds, such as heterocyclic amines (HCAs), to the bacteria. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the binding capacity of bifidobacterial strains of human origin on mutagenic heterocyclic amines which are suspected to play a role in human cancers. In vitro binding of the mutagens Trp-p-2, IQ, MeIQx, 7,8DiMeIQx and PhIP by three bacterial strains in two media of different pH was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4 showed the highest decrease in the total HCAs content, followed by Bifidobacterium longum, and Escherichia coli. pH affects binding capacity; the highest binding was obtained at pH 6.8. Gram-positive tested strains were found to be consistently more effective than the gram-negative strain. There were significant decreases in the amount of HCAs in the presence of different cell concentrations of B. pseudocatenulatum G4; the highest decrease was detected at the concentration of 10(10) cfu/ml. The results showed that HCAs were able to bind with all bacterial strains tested in vitro, thus it may be possible to decrease their absorption by human intestine and increase their elimination via faeces.
TI  - Distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-N-biose I, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  - This study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-N-biose I (LNB) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. LNB is a building block for the human milk oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. A total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase (GLNBP) gene (lnpA) and examined for growth when LNB was used as the sole carbohydrate source. While all strains of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. breve, and B. bifidum were able to grow on LNB, none of the strains of B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. angulatum, B. animalis subsp. lactis, and B. thermophilum showed any growth. In addition, some strains of B. pseudocatenulatum, B. animalis subsp. animalis, and B. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize LNB. With the exception for B. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpA coincided with LNB utilization in almost all strains. These results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of LNB. These findings support the hypothesis that GLNBP plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.
TI  - Production of exopolysaccharides by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  - This work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in milk. The strains belong to the species Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The molar mass distribution of EPS fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some EPS from bacteria of food origin. In general, we detected an association between the EPS size distribution and the EPS-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial EPS tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. The main monosaccharide components of the EPS under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial EPS. All EPS-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the EPS-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. With respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, L. plantarum H2 and L. rhamnosus E41 and E43R were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. Therefore, these human EPS-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. This is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of EPS isolated from human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Relationship between the resistance to bile salts and low pH with exopolysaccharide (EPS) production of Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from infants feces and breast milk.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relation between resistance to bile salts and low pH with exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing of Bifidobacterium spp. In this study, a total of 31 Bifidobacterium spp. were isolated from breast fed infants feces and breast milk samples. As a result of the identification tests, isolates were identified as Bifidobacterium breve (15 strains), B. bifidum (11 strains), B. pseudocatenulatum (3 strains) and B. longum (2 strains). Bifidobacterium spp. were determined exopolysaccharide (EPS) production. EPS productions observed at chance rations (38.00-97.64 mg/l) among of Bifidobacterium spp. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium spp. were determined resistance to bile salts and low pH. Positive correlations between production of exopolysaccharide and resistance to bile salts (p<0.01) or low pH (p<0.01) were found Bifidobacterium spp. This investigation showed that high EPS production of Bifidobacteria may be important in the selection of probiotic strains for resistance to bile salts and low pH.
TI  - Exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  - Although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. We performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rRNA gene sequences (16S rRNA gene and internally transcribed spacer [ITS] 16S-23S spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. A total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. Analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa, i.e., Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e., Bifidobacterium dentium and Bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. Analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. We encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. In contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). Notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.
TI  - Isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - The objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. Twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by F6PPK (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTi-PCR). Bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum. PCR-DGGE revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. Sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as Bifidobacterium breve, B. adolescentis, B. longum, B. bifidum, and B. dentium. Bifidobacterial DNA was detected by qRTi-PCR in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16S rRNA gene copies per ml. In conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.
TI  - Comparison of intestinal microflora in healthy infants and infants with allergic  colitis.
AB  - Twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. Bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. All bifidobacteria-free infants possessed Gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. These bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific FISH probe. Infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. In healthy infants, Bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by B. adolescentis (20.0), B. breve (18.2), B. bifidum (16.4), B. dentium (10.9) and B. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). Bifidobacterial isolates from two babies with allergic colitis were identified as B. longum, one child from patients group contained species B. dentium and one baby B. adolescentis. Our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.
TI  - Effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  - Prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. The bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of Bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. Changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time PCR in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. The prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low G+C % Gram-positive species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, P=0.019). The composition of the genus Bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. Between three and five Bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. Real-time PCR was employed to quantify the four most prevalent Bifidobacterium spp., B. adolescentis, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum and B. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. B. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (P=0.001). B. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (P<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.
TI  - Improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the Bifidobacterium catenulatum pBC1 replicon.
AB  - This study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pBC1, a cryptic plasmid from Bifidobacterium catenulatum L48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. These vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight Bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in Lactococcus lactis or Lactobacillus casei. They showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. Vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the lacZalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in Escherichia coli. The functionality of the vectors for engineering Bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to Bifidobacterium longum. E. coli and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.
TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by intestinal Bifidobacterium strains act as fermentable substrates for human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Eleven exopolysaccharides (EPS) isolated from different human intestinal Bifidobacterium strains were tested in fecal slurry batch cultures and compared with glucose and the prebiotic inulin for their abilities to act as fermentable substrates for intestinal bacteria. During incubation, the increases in levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were considerably more pronounced in cultures with EPS, glucose, and inulin than in controls without carbohydrates added, indicating that the substrates assayed were fermented by intestinal bacteria. Shifts in molar proportions of SCFA during incubation with EPS and inulin caused a decrease in the acetic acid-to-propionic acid ratio, a possible indicator of the hypolipidemic effect of prebiotics, with the lowest values for this parameter being obtained for EPS from the species Bifidobacterium longum and from Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strain C52. This behavior was contrary to that found with glucose, a carbohydrate not considered to be a prebiotic and for which a clear increase of this ratio was obtained during incubation. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that EPS exerted a moderate bifidogenic effect, which was comparable to that of inulin for some polymers but which was lower than that found for glucose. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA gene fragments using universal primers was employed to analyze microbial groups other than bifidobacteria. Changes in banding patterns during incubation with EPS indicated microbial rearrangements of Bacteroides and Escherichia coli relatives. Moreover, the use of EPS from B. pseudocatenulatum in fecal cultures from some individuals accounted for the prevalence of Desulfovibrio and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas incubation with EPS from B. longum supported populations close to Anaerostipes, Prevotella, and/or Oscillospira. Thus, EPS synthesized by intestinal bifidobacteria could act as fermentable substrates for microorganisms in the human gut environment, modifying interactions among intestinal populations.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the probiotic properties of human intestinal Bifidobacterium species and selection of new probiotic candidates.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to identify and select new probiotic strains among majority intestinal bifidobacterial species from healthy Spaniards. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty isolates belonging to seven Bifidobacterium species were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analysis addressing beneficial and undesirable traits. Approx. 45% of the isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, and about 20% of these grew at pH 3.5. Undesirable enzymatic activities, such as alpha-chymotrypsin, beta-glucuronidase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase were not detected. Atypical antibiotic resistances were not observed, except for tetracycline resistance in a single strain. Intestinal pathogens were inhibited to some extent by all analysed strains. All selected strains adhered to human epithelial cells in a strain-dependent manner, and none was able to degrade pig mucin. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these in vitro analyses, strains of Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum are here proposed as new probiotic candidates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although in vivo analyses are still needed, these strains belonging to unusual species in the portfolio of probiotic suppliers are thought to be more appropriated than those currently in use, as they show desirable properties and are preponderant among human intestinal populations.
TI  - Evaluation of the PCR method for identification of Bifidobacterium species.
AB  - AIMS: Bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. Although various polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the identification of Bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported PCR primer sets designed to amplify 16S rDNA, 23S rDNA, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive DNA sequences of various Bifidobacterium species. CONCLUSIONS: Ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. pseudocatenulatum, B. breve, B. bifidum, B. longum, B. longum biovar infantis and B. dentium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results suggest that published Bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of Bifidobacterium species using PCR. Improvement of existing PCR methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other Bifidobacterium strains, such as B. animalis, B. catenulatum, B. thermophilum and B. subtile.
TI  - Safety evaluation of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4 as assessed in BALB/c mice.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the safety of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4 in BALB/c mice that involves examination of bacterial translocation, changes in the internal organs and histology of the intestinal lining. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned into five groups (n = 8). Three groups were orally fed with 50 microl of three different concentrations of B. pseudocatenulatum G4 (2 x 10(4), 1 x 10(8) and 1 x 10(11) CFU day(-1)) for 4 weeks. One group was orally administered with 50 microl of 1 x 10(8) CFU B. longum BB536 per day for 4 weeks and last group was used as a nonbifidobacterial treatment control, which received 50 microl of skim milk. The administered strains did not affect the general health of mice and incapable of carrying out translocation to blood or liver. There were no significant differences in the internal organ (liver, heart, kidney and spleen) indices, serum enzymes of liver (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphate, alanine aminotransferase) and kidney (urea and creatinine) and histology (villi height, crypts height, mucosa thickness and epithelial cell height) of caecum, ileum and colon. CONCLUSION: Administration of high dose of up to 1 x 10(11) CFU B. pseudocatenulatum G4 per day to mice did not show any health threatening symptoms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum G4 is none pathogenic to BALB/c mice and could be safe probiotic for human consumption.
TI  - Inhibitory impact of bifidobacteria on the transfer of beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae in the gnotobiotic mouse digestive tract.
AB  - While looking for new means to limit the dissemination of antibiotic resistance,  we evaluated the role of potentially probiotic bifidobacteria on the transfer of resistance genes between enterobacteria. Transfers of bla genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (SHV-5 and CTX-M-15) were studied in the absence or presence of bifidobacteria. In vitro, transfer frequencies of these bla genes decreased significantly in the presence of three of five tested strains, i.e., Bifidobacterium longum CUETM-89-215, Bifidobacterium bifidum CIP-56.7T, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CIP-104168T. Four transfer experiments were conducted in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice, the first three observing the effect of B. longum CUETM-89-215, B. bifidum CIP-56.7T, and B. pseudocatenulatum CIP-104168T on blaSHV-5 transfer and the fourth experiment studying the effect of B. bifidum CIP-56.7T on blaCTX-M-15 transfer. These experiments revealed significant decreases in the transconjugant levels (up to 3 logs) in mice having received B. bifidum CIP-56.7T or B. pseudocatenulatum CIP-104168T compared to control mice. Bifidobacteria appear to have an inhibitory impact on the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The inhibitory effect is associated to specific bifidobacterial strains and may be related to the production of thermostable metabolites by these strains.
TI  - Bifidobacterial diversity determined by culturing and by 16S rDNA sequence analysis in feces and mucosa from ten healthy Spanish adults.
AB  - This study aimed to identify the numerically predominant bifidobacterial species  in feces and mucosa of healthy Spanish people and to determine their phenotypic and genetic diversity. To this end, both traditional culturing and molecular methods were used. A set of 196 bifidobacterial colonies was identified from the counting plates by sequencing of a stretch of their 16S rRNA gene. Representative isolates were phenotypically characterized by their carbohydrate fermentation profile and genotypically typed by RAPD-PCR. Four 16S rDNA libraries composed of 113 clones from two fecal and two mucosal samples were independently analyzed. Seven bifidobacterial species were identified by culturing, and six by 16S rDNA analysis. Both methodologies showed Bifidobacterium longum and B. pseudocatenulatum to predominate in feces and mucosa, although high interindividual variability was noted. High phenotypic variation was observed in the fermentation profile of different isolates from the same species. RAPD analysis showed that two to five strains made up the subjects' personal bifidobacterial communities. The identification of the dominant bifidobacterial species could be useful for the rational design, use, and evaluation of probiotics in our community.
TI  - Screening for plasmids among human bifidobacteria species: sequencing and analysis of pBC1 from Bifidobacterium catenulatum L48.
AB  - Analysis of 72 bifidobacterial isolates for plasmid DNA identified six different  plasmid profiles, two profiles consisted of a single plasmid and four contained at least two. A plasmid identified in a Bifidobacterium catenulatum strain (pBC1) was chosen for further characterization based on its small size and stability. The plasmid was shown to be a circular molecule of 2540 base pairs with an overall G+C content of 64%. At the putative origin of replication a direct repeat of 24 nucleotides repeated three and a half times was observed, as well as five inverted repeats, which resembled the organization of theta-type replicating plasmids. Three open reading frames encoding peptides larger than 50 amino acids were also identified: repB, encoding a replicase of 315 amino acids, a transcriptionally coupled gene (orfX-like), similar to the orfX of some theta-replicating lactococcal plasmids, and copG-like in the complementary strand, which showed a conserved domain present in proteins of the CopG family. Comparison of the deduced RepB protein of pBC1 to other replication proteins in databases, identified pMB1 from Bifidobacterium longum as its closest relative (81% amino acid identity). The pBC1 replicon proved to be functional in several Bifidobacterium species, including B. animalis, B. longum, and B. pseudocatenulatum. Hybridization experiments showed the replicon was uncommon among bifidobacteria. The relative copy number of pBC1 was estimated to be 30.9+/-4.62 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
TI  - Characterization of the genus Bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16S rRNA gene sequences.
AB  - In order to characterize the genus Bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (Escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16S rRNA gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus Bifidobacterium were determined. Ribopatterns obtained from Bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters I-IX) with a similarity of 60%. Cluster V, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. In the genus Bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to Miyake et al.: (i) the Bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the B. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the B. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the B. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences in each group. Using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. Ribopatterns of six B. adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16S rRNA gene sequences. B. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous strains. The nine strains of B. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. Each type strain of B. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and B. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by Yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. B. animalis subsp. animalis and B. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using Eco RI. We conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of Bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is a useful tool for the characterization of Bifidobacterium species in combination with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.
TI  - [Analysis of Bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE)].
AB  - Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) method combined with 16S rDNA clone library profiling was used to analyze Bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut in this study. Bifidobacteria group-specific TGGE patterns of 10 healthy human individuals showed that the Bifidobacteria population in humans was host-specific. The genomic diversity and species composition of Bifidobacteria in different individual was dissimilar. Through sequencing and TGGE comigration analysis of the Bifidobacteria group-specific amplicons for one healthy boy, it was revealed that the TGGE bands of this individual represented species Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. infantis, B. longum, B. adolescentis, B. pseudocatenulatum and one potentially new species, respectively. B. pseudocatenulatum was the most common species of tested samples. While as control, only two species- B. pseudocatenulatum and B. longum were isolated using traditional culture method. Bifidobacteria group-specific PCR based TGGE method combined with 16S rDNA clone library profiling is a sensitive and effective approach to resolve the population structure of Bifidobacteria in microflora of human intestinal tract.
TI  - Conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - The cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. Strain identification to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16S rRNA gene and confirmed by DNA/DNA reassociation experiments. The isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. Cell surface properties of Bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. The results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were considered. On the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested Bifidobacterium strains. The highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in B. bifidum and B. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the pH of the medium. Moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of B. bifidum and B. adolescentis strains.
TI  - [Analysis of the probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  - To investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 Chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16S rDNA sequencing and homology analysis. For identification of the key probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers Im26/Im3 and L159/L677 for PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA were used. The results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). Culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected at levels of 10(7) CFU/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and 85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. In addition, B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. infantis and B. thermacidophium have also been found. L. mucosae, L. fermentum, L. salivarius, L. ruminis, L. gasseri and L. plantarum are isolated from the stools. L. mucosae (3.68 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and L. fermentum (3.97 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of Lactobacillus. Study on Chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.
TI  - Genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16S rRNA gene analysis.
AB  - A novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16S rRNA gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. Simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO BC provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). The three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. This analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. Cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the DGGE patterns showed that most of clones retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum, and Bacteroides. We found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale and Eubacterium hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. However, amplicons affiliated with Bacteroides and Ruminococcus obeum- and Eubacterium biforme-like bacteria, as well as Butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. Furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the Clostridium leptum cluster. The bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; B. longum and B. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while B. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.
TI  - Phytase activity as a novel metabolic feature in Bifidobacterium.
AB  - Phytase activity has been detected for the first time in Bifidobacterium spp. These bacteria were able to dephosphorylate phytic acid (myo-inositol hexaphosphate, IP(6)) and generate several myo-inositol phosphate intermediates (IP(3)-IP(5)). B. globosum and B. pseudocatenulatum were optimally active at neutral-alkaline pH and B. adolescentis, B. angulatum and B. longum at acid pH. B. pseudocatenulatum showed the highest levels of phytase activity. This species produced maximum activity in the exponential phase of growth and when fructo-oligosaccharides were used as carbon source in the culture medium. The potential role of phytase activity from Bifidobacterium spp. in the reduction of the antinutritional properties of IP(6) is discussed.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - One hundred and twenty-two strains of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (Sensititre Anaero3; Treck Diagnostic Systems). The upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were completed on MRS agar plates by the NCCLS procedure. All strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. Bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the lactobacilli were resistant. Approximately 30% of the Bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five Lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. None of the tested Bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. Single strains of Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. Most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.
TI  - Genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from intestinal samples of Finnish adult subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. Identification results obtained with PCR-ELISA and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) gave tentative identification only to Bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the B. longum isolates. The most commonly detected species were B. longum biotype longum followed by B. adolescentis and B. bifidum. In addition, B. animalis (lactis), B. angulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum were found. Ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also RAPD revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. Besides two B. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. CONCLUSIONS: Several species/strains of bifidobacteria simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy Finnish adults and intestinal Bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. Functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Applicability of ribotyping with the automated RiboPrinter System for identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.
TI  - Bifidobacterial species differentially affect expression of cell surface markers  and cytokines of dendritic cells harvested from cord blood.
AB  - The gut microbiota may be important in the postnatal development of the immune system and hence may influence the prevalence of atopic diseases. Bifidobacteria are the most numerous bacteria in the guts of infants, and the presence or absence of certain species could be important in determining the geographic incidence of atopic diseases. We compared the fecal populations of bifidobacteria from children aged 25 to 35 days in Ghana (which has a low prevalence of atopy), New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (high-prevalence countries). Natal origin influenced the detection of bifidobacterial species in that fecal samples from Ghana almost all contained Bifidobacterium infantis whereas those of the other children did not. Choosing species on the basis of our bacteriological results, we tested bifidobacterial preparations for their effects on cell surface markers and cytokine production by dendritic cells harvested from cord blood. Species-specific effects on the expression of the dendritic-cell activation marker CD83 and the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) were observed. Whereas CD83 expression was increased and IL-10 production was induced by Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, B. infantis failed to produce these effects. We concluded that B. infantis does not trigger the activation of dendritic cells to the degree necessary to initiate an immune response but that B. bifidum, B. longum, and B. pseudocatenulatum induce a Th2-driven immune response. A hypothesis is presented to link our observations to the prevalence of atopic diseases in different countries.
TI  - Enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  - Thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. Bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by TPY agar and FISH procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) CFU/g. Three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. One child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. All bifidobacteria-free infants possessed Gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. These bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific FISH probe. In bifidobacteria-positive samples, B. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by B. adolescentis (31.6%), B. bifidum (21.0%), B. breve (10.5%), B. pseudocatenulatum (5.3%), and B. dentium (5.3%).
TI  - In vitro digestion of sinigrin and glucotropaeolin by single strains of Bifidobacterium and identification of the digestive products.
AB  - Three strains of Bifidobacterium sp., B. pseudocatenulatum, B. adolescentis, and  B. longum were studied for their ability to digest glucosinolates, sinigrin (SNG) and glucotropaeolin (GTL), in vitro. All strains digested both glucosinolates during 24-48 h cultivation, accompanied by a decline in the medium pH from 7.1 to 5.2. The digestion of glucosinolates by a cell-free extract prepared from sonicated cells of B. adolescentis, but not cultivated broth, increased in the presence of 0.5 mM l-ascorbic acid. Also, a time-dependent formation of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) was observed when the cell-free extract was incubated with 0.25 mM SNG for 120 min at pH 7.0. These reaction features suggest that the digestive activity may have been due to an enzyme similar to myrosinase, an enzyme of plant origin. GC-MS analysis of the Bifidobacterial cultured broth showed that the major products were 3-butenenitrile (BCN) and phenylacetonitrile (PhACN), from SNG and GTL, respectively and nitriles, probably due to a decrease in the pH of the media. AITC and benzyl isothiocyanate (BzITC) were barely detectable in the broth. It was concluded that the three species of Bifidobacteria could be involved in digestive degradation of glucosinolates in the human intestinal tract.
TI  - Multiplex PCR using 16S rRNA gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  - Three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeted on Bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. The selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. Three to four pairs were gathered in one PCR reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using DNA from 26 reference strains. Using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, B. bifidum, B. longum and B. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while B. adolescentis, B. catenulatum/B. pseudocatenulatum continuum and B. longum species were predominant in adults. Thus, a single PCR can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of PCR reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. Moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in DNA extracts from human stools.
TI  - Species specific identification of nine human Bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  - Based on the 16S rDNA sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by DNA amplification of nine human Bifidobacterium spp., namely B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. infantis, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum. B. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. The primers were designed to target different positions of the 16S rDNA, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of Bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. The identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an AluI restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16S rDNA. This multiple primer DNA amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of Bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. The technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.
TI  - Identification, detection, and enumeration of human bifidobacterium species by PCR targeting the transaldolase gene.
AB  - Methods that enabled the identification, detection, and enumeration of Bifidobacterium species by PCR targeting the transaldolase gene were tested. Bifidobacterial species isolated from the feces of human adults and babies were identified by PCR amplification of a 301-bp transaldolase gene sequence and comparison of the relative migrations of the DNA fragments in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Two subtypes of Bifidobacterium longum, five subtypes of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and two subtypes of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum could be differentiated using PCR-DGGE. Bifidobacterium angulatum and B. catenulatum type cultures could not be differentiated from each other. Bifidobacterial species were also detected directly in fecal samples by this combination of PCR and DGGE. The number of species detected was less than that detected by PCR using species-specific primers targeting 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Real-time quantitative PCR targeting a 110-bp transaldolase gene sequence was used to enumerate bifidobacteria in fecal samples. Real-time quantitative PCR measurements of bifidobacteria in fecal samples from adults correlated well with results obtained by culture when either a 16S rDNA sequence or the transaldolase gene sequence was targeted. In the case of samples from infants, 16S rDNA-targeted PCR was superior to PCR targeting the transaldolase gene for the quantification of bifidobacterial populations.
TI  - Molecular microbial analysis of Bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA).
AB  - One hundred and six isolates of the genus Bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Two restriction endonucleases (Sau3AI and BamHI) were chosen for aligning the 16S rRNA sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. A rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16S rDNA digestion profiles of 16 Bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. All of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. The present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium coryneforme, Bifidobacterium cuniculi, Bifidobacterium dentium, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium suis, Bifidobacterium magnum, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.
TI  - Adhesion of Bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  - Twenty-four Bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. Each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. No significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. Among the tested bacteria, B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. infantis, B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of B. animalis and B. lactis was not preferential. These results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.
TI  - Metabolization of beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides by different bifidobacteria.
AB  - Low-molecular-mass beta-(2,6)-linked fructose-oligosaccharides (beta-(2,6)-FOS) were examined as a new carbohydrate source for growth of bifidobacteria. beta-(2,6)-FOS were prepared from microbial high-molecular-mass levan by acid hydrolysis and refined by cation-exchange chromatography. (13)C-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of predominantly beta-(2,6)-fructosyl linkages in the oligosaccharides. More than 80% beta-(2,6)-FOS was recovered after in vitro incubation with amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, implying resistance to degradation in the upper intestinal tract. Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. longum, B. breve, and B. pseudocatenulatum were studied in vitro for their ability to metabolize beta-(2,6)-FOS. Growth, decrease in pH, formation of short- chain fatty acids (lactate, acetate, formate) and degradation of beta-(2,6)-FOS were markedly different among species. B. adolescentis showed the best growth, produced the highest amounts of organic acids and metabolized both short- and long-chain beta-(2, 6)-FOS.
TI  - Distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  - In order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific PCR technique was developed and used with DNAs extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. To cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for Bifidobacterium longum, B. infantis, B. dentium, and B. gallicum were developed and used with primers for B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, and the B. catenulatum group (B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (T. Matsuki, K. Watanabe, R. Tanaka, and H. Oyaizu, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 167:113-121, 1998). The specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by PCR, and the species-specific PCR method was found to be a useful means for identifying Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. The results of an examination of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the B. catenulatum group was the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by B. longum and B. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and that B. breve, B. infantis, and B. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. The present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.
TI  - Origin and identification of bifidobacteria strains isolated from meat and meat products.
AB  - Forty-seven strains of bifidobacteria isolated from meat and meat products have been identified following phenotypic numerical analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization. Twenty-three strains were identified to the species B. thermophilum and 14 to B. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum. All others were also of animal origin, except for two strains -- B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum -- that were of human origin. These strains were isolated from artificially contaminated meat by manual handling.
TI  - Rapid identification of human intestinal bifidobacteria by 16S rRNA-targeted species- and group-specific primers.
AB  - On the basis of 16S rRNA sequences, species- and group-specific primers for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. bifidum, B. breve, the B. catenulatum group (B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum), and the B. longum group (B. longum and B. infantis), which are species commonly found in human intestinal tracts, were developed. The specificity of these primers was confirmed through the use of DNA extracted from 46 strains of 31 Bifidobacterium species, as well as 14 non-bifidobacterial species that are the predominant bacteria in the human intestinal tract. The present species-specific primers were applied to the identification of 43 isolated strains, consisting of six strains of B. adolescentis, eight of the B. catenulatum group, seven of B. bifidum, nine of B. breve, and 13 of the B. longum group.
TI  - Degradation of complex carbohydrates by Bifidobacterium spp.
AB  - Two hundred and ninety strains of 29 species of bifidobacteria from human and animal origin were surveyed for their ability to ferment complex carbohydrates. The substrates fermented by the largest number of species were D-galactosamine, D-glucosamine, amylose and amylopectin. Many of the species isolated from animal habitats showed reduced fermentation activity. Bifidobacterium dentium strains fermented gum guar and gum locust bean; porcine gastric mucin was fermented only by B. bifidum, B. infantis was the only species to ferment D-glucuronic acid; strains of B. longum fermented arabinogalactan and the gums arabic, ghatti and tragacanth; alpha-L-fucose was fermented by strains of B. breve, B. infantis and B. pseudocatenulatum. A key to the differentiation of Bifidobacterium species of human origin is provided.
TI  - Phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  - The phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus Bifidobacterium were studied. These organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). Our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. Seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. Among the human strains, the type strains of Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and B. catenulatum fell into group I, which contained the type strains of B. adolescentis (subgroup Ib), B. dentium (subgroup Ic), and B. angulatum (ungrouped). The type strain of B. breve belonged to subgroup IIIa1, and the type strains of B. infantis and B. longum fell into subgroup IIIb1. Group VII comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. Among the animal strains, group II consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of B. suis (subgroup IIb), B. thermophilum (subgroup IIf), B. choerinum, and B. boum (ungrouped). Wild strains belonging to group V were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of B. animalis (subgroup Va), B. magnum (subgroup Vb), B. pseudolongum, and B. globosum (subgroup Vc). The strains of human origin (groups I, III, and VII) were well separated from the animal strains (groups II, IV, and V). It was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. Thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. The acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate Bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by Mitsuoka (Bifidobacteria Microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and Scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in P. H. A. Sneath, N. S. Mair, M. E. Sharpe, and J. G. Holt, ed., Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). However, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
TI  - Species of the genus Bifidobacterium in the feces of human adults.
AB  - In order to obtain information about the intestinal bifid microflora of human adults, a total of 288 strains of bifidobacteria isolated from 29 out of 36 fecal specimens were studied. Their assignment to known species of the genus Bifidobacterium was based on polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses of soluble cellular proteins. The strains were classified as B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. catenulatum, B. longum, B. pseudocatenulatum. The distribution of these species is reported.
TI  - Species of the Bifidobacterium in the feces of infants.
AB  - A total of 907 strains of bifidobacteria isolated from the feces of breast-fed and artificial milk-fed infants were studied. Their assignment to known species of the genus Bifidobacterium was primarily based on DNA homology relationships. The strains were classified as B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. infantis, B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum. The distribution of these species is reported.
