TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == microbiological and biochemical study of coffee fermentation.
AB  == the coffee fermentation microflora were rich and mainly constituted of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, with erwinia and klebsiella genuses at the highest frequencies. the best population increase was observed with lactic acid bacteria  and yeasts, whereas those microorganisms that counted on a pectin medium remained constant during the fermentation step. qualitatively, lactic acid bacteria belonged mainly to leuconostoc mesenteroides species but the others microflora were relatively heterogeneous. the microorganisms isolated on pectin medium were  enterobacteriaceae, identified as erwinia herbicola and klebsiella pneumoniae, not reported as strong pectolytic strains. throughout coffee fermentation, 60% of the simple sugars were degraded by the total microflora and not specifically by pectolytic microorganisms.

TI  == purification of leuconostoc mesenteroides citrate lyase and cloning and characterization of the citcdefg gene cluster.
AB  == a citrate lyase (ec 4.1.3.6) was purified 25-fold from leuconostoc mesenteroides  and was shown to contain three subunits. the first 42 amino acids of the beta subunit were identified, as well as an internal peptide sequence spanning some 20 amino acids into the alpha subunit. using degenerated primers from these sequences, we amplified a 1.2-kb dna fragment by pcr from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. this fragment was used as a probe for screening a  leuconostoc genomic bank to identify the structural genes. the 2.7-kb gene cluster encoding citrate lyase of l. mesenteroides is organized in three open reading frames, citd, cite, and citf, encoding, respectively, the three citrate lyase subunits gamma (acyl carrier protein [acp]), beta (citryl-s-acp lyase; ec 4.1.3.34), and alpha (citrate:acetyl-acp transferase; ec 2.8.3.10). the gene (citc) encoding the citrate lyase ligase (ec 6.2.1.22) was localized in the region upstream of citd. protein comparisons show similarities with the citrate lyase ligase and citrate lyase of klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. downstream of the citrate lyase cluster, a 1.4-kb open reading frame  encoding a 52-kda protein was found. the deduced protein is similar to citg of the other bacteria, and its function remains unknown. expression of the citcdefg  gene cluster in escherichia coli led to the detection of a citrate lyase activity only in the presence of acetyl coenzyme a, which is a structural analog of the prosthetic group. this shows that the acetyl-acp group of the citrate lyase form  in e. coli is not complete or not linked to the protein.

TI  == membrane potential-generating malate (mlep) and citrate (citp) transporters of lactic acid bacteria are homologous proteins. substrate specificity of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter family.
AB  == membrane potential generation via malate/lactate exchange catalyzed by the malate carrier (mlep) of lactococcus lactis, together with the generation of a ph gradient via decarboxylation of malate to lactate in the cytoplasm, is a typical  example of a secondary proton motive force-generating system. the mlep gene was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in a malolactic fermentation-deficient l. lactis strain. functional analysis revealed the same properties as observed in membrane  vesicles of a malolactic fermentation-positive strain. mlep belongs to a family of secondary transporters in which the citrate carriers from leuconostoc mesenteroides (citp) and klebsiella pneumoniae (cits) are found also. citp, but not cits, is also involved in membrane potential generation via electrogenic citrate/lactate exchange. mlep, citp, and cits were analyzed for their substrate  specificity. the 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif r1r2cohcooh, common to the physiological substrates, was found to be essential for transport although some 2-oxocarboxylates could be transported to a lesser extent. clear differences in substrate specificity among the transporters were observed because of different tolerances toward the r substituents at the c2 atom. both mlep and citp transport a broad range of 2-hydroxycarboxylates with r substituents ranging in size from two hydrogen atoms (glycolate) to acetyl and methyl groups (citromalate) for mlep and two acetyl groups (citrate) for citp. cits was much less tolerant and transported only citrate and at a low rate citromalate. the substrate specificities are discussed in the context of the physiological function of the transporters.

TI  == membrane potential-generating transport of citrate and malate catalyzed by citp of leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  == citrate uptake in leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides 19d is catalyzed by a secondary citrate carrier (citp). the kinetics and mechanism of citp were investigated in membrane vesicles of l. mesenteroides. the transporter is induced by the presence of citrate in the medium and transports both citrate and malate.  in spite of sequence homology to the na(+)-dependent citrate carrier of klebsiella pneumoniae, citp is not na(+)-dependent, nor is citp mg(2+)-dependent. the ph gradient (delta ph) is a driving force for citrate and malate uptake into  the membrane vesicles, whereas the membrane potential (delta psi) counteracts transport. an inverted membrane potential (inside positive) generated by thiocyanide diffusion can drive citrate and malate uptake in membrane vesicles. analysis of the forces involved showed that a single unit of negative charge is translocated during transport. kinetic analysis of citrate counterflow at different ph values indicated that citp transports the dianionic form of citrate  (hcit2-) with an affinity constant of approximately 20 microns. it is concluded that citp catalyzes hcit2-/h+ symport. translocation of negative charge into the  cell during citrate metabolism results in the generation of a membrane potential  that contributes to the protonmotive force across the cytoplasmic membrane, i.e.  citrate metabolism in l. mesenteroides generates metabolic energy. efficient exchange of citrate and d-lactate, a product of citrate/carbohydrate co-metabolism, is observed, suggesting that under physiological conditions, citp  may function as an electrogenic precursor/product exchanger rather than a symporter. the mechanism and energetic consequences of citrate uptake are similar to malate uptake in lactic acid bacteria.
