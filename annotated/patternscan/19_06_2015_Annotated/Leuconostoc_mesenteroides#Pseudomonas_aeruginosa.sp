TI  == phosphoketolases from lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pseudomonas aeruginosa: dissimilar sequences, similar substrates but distinct enzymatic characteristics.
AB  == phosphoketolases (pks) are large thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp)-dependent enzymes playing key roles in a number of essential pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. the putative pk genes of lactococcus lactis (ll) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (lm) were cloned in a prokaryotic vector, and the encoded proteins were expressed and purified yielding high purity proteins termed pk-ll and pk-lm, respectively.  similarly, the pk gene of pseudomonas aeruginosa was expressed, and the corresponding protein (pk-pa) was purified to homogeneity. the amino acid sequences predicted on the basis of genes' nucleotide sequences were confirmed by mass spectrometry and display low relative similarities. circular dichroism (cd)  spectra of these proteins predict higher alpha-helix than beta-strand contents. in addition, it is predicted that pk-ll contains tightly packed domains. enzymatic analysis showed that all three recombinant proteins, despite their dissimilar amino acid sequences, are active pks and accept both xylulose 5-phosphate (x5p) and fructose 6-phosphate (f6p) as substrates. however, they display substantially higher preference for x5p than for f6p. kinetic measurements indicated that pk-pa has the lowest km values for x5p and f6p suggesting the highest capacity for substrate binding. pk-ll has the largest kcat values for both substrates. nevertheless, in terms of substrate specificity constant, pk-pa has been found to be the most active pk against x5p. structural models for all three analysed pks predict similar folds in spite of amino acid sequence dissimilarities and contribute to understanding the enzymatic peculiarities of pk-pa compared to pk-ll and pk-lm.

TI  == blue light (470 nm) effectively inhibits bacterial and fungal growth.
AB  == blue light (470 nm) led antimicrobial properties were studied alone against bacteria and with or without the food grade photosensitizer, erythrosine (ery) against filamentous fungi. leuconostoc mesenteroides (lm), bacillus atrophaeus (ba) or pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) aliquots were exposed on nutrient agar plates to array 1 (ar1, 0.2 mw cm(-2)) or array 2 (ar2, 80 mw cm(-2)), which emitted impure or pure blue light (0-300 j cm(-2)), respectively. inoculated control (room light only) plates were incubated (48 h) and colonies enumerated. the antifungal properties of blue light combined with ery (11.4 and 22.8 mumol l(-1)) on penicillium digitatum (pd) and fusarium graminearum (fg) conidia were determined. conidial controls consisted of: no light, room light-treated conidia  and ery plus room light. light-treated (ery + blue light) conidial samples were exposed only to ar2 (0-100 j cm(-2)), aliquots spread on potato dextrose agar plates, incubated (48 h, 30 degrees c) and colonies counted. blue light alone significantly reduced bacterial and fg viability. combined with ery, it significantly reduced pd viability. blue light is lethal to bacteria and filamentous fungi although effectiveness is dependent on light purity, energy levels and microbial genus. significance and impact of the study: light from two  arrays of different blue leds significantly reduced bacterial (leuconostoc mesenteroides, bacillus atrophaeus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) viabilities. significant in vitro viability loss was observed for the filamentous fungi, penicillium digitatum and fusarium graminearum when exposed to pure blue light only plus a photosensitizer. f. graminearum viability was significantly reduced by blue light alone. results suggest that (i) the amount of significant loss in bacterial viability observed for blue light that is pure or with traces of other  wavelengths is genus dependent and (ii) depending on fungal genera, pure blue light is fungicidal with or without a photosensitizer.

TI  == characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing strains of lactobacillus plantarum st23ld and st341ld, enterococcus faecium st311ld and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides st33ld were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. the bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria (e. faecalis, l. casei and streptococcus pneumoniae), but also escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. strain st23ld produced two bacteriocins (st23lda and st23ldb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kda, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 au/ml after 18 h of growth. the same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin st341ld (approximately 3.0 kda), but after  16 h. bacteriocins st311ld (ca. 2.3 kda) and st33ld (ca. 2.7 kda) were produced at much lower levels (6400 au/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and triton x, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees c. addition of bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st311ld to cells of lactobacillus casei lhs in logarithmic phase resulted in  growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density  over the next seven hours. bacteriocin st33ld also inhibited the growth of strain lhs, but to a lesser extent. bacteriocins st23ld, st341ld and st33ld remained at  the same level of activity for 6 h at ph<4.0. however, the activity of bacteriocin st311ld decreased by 50% within 2 h at ph 4.4. the possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == numerical survey of some bacterial taxa.
AB  == focht, d. d. (iowa state university, ames), and w. r. lockhart. numerical survey  of some bacterial taxa. j. bacteriol. 90:1314-1319. 1965.-a numerical analysis was made of 77 properties of each of 43 bacterial strains, representing 25 genera from 8 families in the orders eubacteriales and pseudomonadales. four major groups were found, related to one another at approximately the same level of similarity: (1) a large cluster containing the subgroups (1a) athiorhodaceae-spirillaceae, (1b) xanthomonas, and (1c) "inactive" micrococcaceae-achromobacteraceae; (2) a cluster containing the "active" micrococcaceae and lactobacillaceae; (3) the enterobacteria; and (4) aeromonas. there was a sharp distinction between the branches of groups 1a, 1c, and 2. the composition of groups was essentially the same whether or not fermentation of carbohydrates (28 characters) was included in the analysis. several individual strains, notably, bacillus subtilis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and erwinia amylovora, were related to none of the groups, and others (two species of proteus, flavobacterium devorans, and lactobacillus casei) showed only minimal quantitative relationships with their groups. these results suggest  that there may be significant variation in levels of similarity within microbial  groups presently accorded equivalent taxonomic rank, and that some present distinctions among taxa, particularly at the generic level, cannot be confirmed on the basis of overall similarity.
