TI  - Antimicrobial Efficacy of Ten Commercially Available Herbal Dentifrices against Specific Oral Microflora - In Vitro Study.
AB  - AIM: To determine and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific strains of oral microflora using a standard diffusion method at full strength and 1:1 dilution at 24 h. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The standard strains of Streptococcus. mutans (ATCC 21293), Streptococcus sangius (MTCC 442), Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 3268), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 2592), Streptococcus pyogenes (MTCC 442) and Candida albicans (ATCC 183) were obtained. Antimicrobial efficacy of the dentifrices was tested in triplicate, at full strength and 1:1 dilution with the sterile water using a standard diffusion method for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The antimicrobial efficacy was tested by observing the zones of inhibition in millimeters surrounding disk containing the dentifrice. Mean standard deviation and standard error of mean of the inhibitory zones was calculated for each herbal dentifrice. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Danth Kanthi (DK) was the most effective against all the microorganisms producing larger zones of inhibition at 24 h (F.S - 40+/-1.5; 1:1 dilution - 40+/-2.71). Amar Premium (AP) also produced larger zones of inhibition against all microorganisms except S. aureus. Of all the dentifrices, least zones of inhibitions i.e., around 5 mm was observed against S. aureus by Amar Premium (AP) and Dabur Babool (DB) at 24 h. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that all herbal dentifrices exhibited antimicrobial activity against the selected oral microorganisms, with DK being the most effective. Hence, it can be inferred that herbal dentifrices can also be recommended like the conventional formulations.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - The microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. METHODS: Thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from January 2008 to June 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). Of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. S. aureus was identified in 18 cases, Gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. In addition to Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Corynebacterium simulans, Dermabacter hominis, Finegoldia magna, and Peptoniphilus harei. Seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. All cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification for diagnosis.
TI  - Influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. The influence of serum complement on NET release therefore remains unclear. We examined the DNA release induced by Staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: Actinomyces viscosus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacteria-stimulated NET release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. Various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (CR1, CD35) and 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18). RESULTS: While the presence of serum markedly enhanced NET release induced by S. aureus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by A. viscosus, there was no enhancement of NET release induced by F. nucleatum. The serum-mediated enhancement of NET release by A. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for S. aureus. Blockade of CR1, significantly reduced NET release induced by S. aureus, A. actinomycetemcomitans and A. viscosus, while blockade of CR3, had no effect. However, opsonization of S. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified IgG promoted NET release. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, complement opsonization promotes NET release induced by a variety of bacteria, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, and CR1 plays a dominant role in the process. Complement consumption or deficiency may compromise NETosis induced by some bacterial species, including A. actinomycetemcomitans. Within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against NETosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.
TI  - Prevalence of canaliculitis after smartplug insertion during long-term follow-up.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term prevalence of canaliculitis associated with the use of SmartPlugs. METHODS: This retrospective study included 42 eyes of 25 dry eye patients at our institution who received a SmartPlug insertion between 2004 and 2008. Irrigation of the lacrimal system was performed in all patients prior to SmartPlug insertion to ensure the patency of the system. The median follow-up time was 7.9 (5.6-10.5) years after plug insertion. RESULTS: Six patients (seven eyes) of 25 patients (42 eyes) developed canaliculitis. The prevalence of canaliculitis per patient was 24%, and the prevalence of canaliculitis per SmartPlug was 16.6%. The median time from SmartPlug insertion to the onset of canaliculitis was 4.7 (1.4-6.0) years. The median age of the affected patients was 61.5 (36-74) years. Five of these patients were women and one was man. The pathogens were identified as Actinomyces in four eyes and as Staphylococcus aureus in three eyes. In five patients (six eyes), the canaliculitis was resolved by the application of topical antibiotics and repeated lacrimal irrigations with antibiotics and povidone-iodine. In one patient, a canaliculotomy was necessary to cure the condition. CONCLUSIONS: The late onset of complications after SmartPlug insertion requires long-term observation to identify the majority of complications associated with SmartPlugs. In our patients with a follow-up of up to 10.5 years, the use of SmartPlugs was associated with the highest prevalence of canaliculitis published thus far.
TI  - Primary Sternal Osteomyelitis Caused by Actinomyces israelii.
AB  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis is a rare disease. Common infectious organisms causing primary sternal osteomyelitis include Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Actinomyces species are common saprophytes of the oral cavity, but there have been few reports in the literature of primary sternal osteomyelitis caused by Actinomyces species. We describe a case of primary sternal osteomyelitis caused by Actinomyces israelii without pulmonary involvement.
TI  - Actinomyces odontolyticus: Rare Etiology for Purulent Pericarditis.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is one of the most common causes of cardiac tamponade and if left untreated has a mortality of 100%. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia have been implicated as the main etiology of purulent pericardial effusion followed by fungi and anaerobic sources. Actinomyces odontolyticus pericardial involvement has been reported in the literature only once. To our knowledge, this is the first fatal case of A. odontolyticus purulent pericarditis in the absence of periodontal disease.
TI  - A commentary on the disparate perspectives of clinical microbiologists and surgeons: ad hoc antimicrobial use.
AB  - Prosthetic joints and other orthopedic implants have improved quality of life for patients world-wide and the use of such devices is increasing. However, while infection rates subsequent to associated surgery are relatively low (<3%), the consequences of incidence are considerable, encompassing morbidity (including amputation) and mortality in addition to significant social and economic costs. Emphasis, therefore, has been placed on mitigating microbial risk, with clinical microbiologists and surgeons utilizing rapidly evolving molecular laboratory techniques in detection and diagnosis of infection, which still occurs despite sophisticated patient management. Multidisciplinary approaches are regularly adopted to achieve this. In this commentary, we describe an unusual case of Actinomyces infection in total hip arthroplasty and, in that context, describe the perspectives of the clinical microbiology and surgical teams and how they contrasted. More specifically, this case demonstrates an ad hoc approach to structured eradication of biofilms and intracellular bacteria related to biomaterials, as reflected in early usage of linezolid. This is a complex topic and, as described in this case, such accelerated treatment can be effective. This commentary focuses on the merits of such inadvisable use of potent antimicrobials amid the risk of diminishing valuable antimicrobial efficacy, albeit resulting in desirable patient outcomes.
TI  - Isolation and structure elucidation of cystargamide, a lipopeptide from Kitasatospora cystarginea.
AB  - A new lipopeptide, cystargamide (1) was isolated from the fermentation broth of the actinomycete Kitasatospora cystarginea. The bacterial strain was selected from a set of 12 Kitasatospora spp. using a secondary metabolomics approach combining liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with principal component analysis (PCA). Cystargamide (1) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the structure elucidation was achieved by interpreting mass spectrometry and NMR data. Cystargamide (1) contains rare structural features including a 5-hydroxy tryptophan residue and a 2,3-epoxydecanoyl fatty acid group.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - An assessment of the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning of Essix orthodontic retainer.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from Essix orthodontic retainers. DESIGN: In vitro laboratory study. SETTING: Department of Orthodontics and Microbiology, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London, UK. METHODS: Study 1: 120 Essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. The effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of Streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. Study 2: 140 Essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans). RELEVANT RESULTS: In study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of Streptococcus mutans. In study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except MRSA-16. For MRSA-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. CONCLUSIONS: All three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the Essix retainers. Brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. The use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.
TI  - [Experimental evaluation of the spraying disinfection efficiency on dental models].
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the disinfect effect after spraying a new kind of disinfectant on the dental plaster models. METHODS: The germ-free plaster samples, which were smeared with bacteria compound including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces albicans, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces viscosus were sprayed with disinfectants (CaviCide) and glutaraldehyde individually. In one group(5 minutes later) and another group(15 minutes later), the colonies were counted for statistical analysis after sampling, inoculating, and culturing which were used for evaluation of disinfecting efficiency. ANOVA was performed using SPSS12.0 software package. RESULTS: All sample bacteria were eradicated after spraying disinfectants(CaviCide) within 5 minutes and effective bacteria control was retained after 15 minutes. There was significant difference between the disinfecting efficiency of CaviCide and glutaraldehyde. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of disinfection with spraying disinfectants (CaviCide) on dental models is quick and effective.
TI  - Primary pulmonary botryomycosis: a bacterial lung infection mimicking lung cancer.
AB  - Primary pulmonary botryomycosis, or bacterial pseudomycosis, is an unusual bacterial infection characterised by the formation of eosinophilic granules that resemble those of Actinomyces species infection. The diagnosis of botryomycosis is based on culture of the granules revealing gram-positive cocci or gram-negative bacilli. The bacterial pathogen most frequently found is Staphylococcus aureus. The pathobiology remains unknown. Pulmonary botryomycosis can resemble actinomycosis, tuberculosis or invasive carcinoma. Definitive treatment requires a combination of both surgical debridement and long-term antimicrobial therapy. We present a case of primary pulmonary botryomycosis in an immunocompetent patient.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial evaluation of neovestitol and vestitol isolated from Brazilian red propolis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of neovestitol and vestitol isolated from Brazilian red propolis (BRP). BRP ethanolic extract (EEP), neovestitol, and vestitol were evaluated by anti-inflammatory properties using a neutrophil migration assay. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) against Streptococcus mutans , Streptococcus sobrinus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Actinomyces naeslundii . Neovestitol, vestitol, and EEP inhibited neutrophil migration at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Regarding antimicrobial activity, neovestitol showed MICs ranging from <6.25 to 25-50 mug/mL and MBCs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/mL, while vestitol showed MICs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/mL and MBCs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/mL. Both isoflavonoids neovestitol and vestitol are consistent bioactive compounds displaying anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities that can strongly act in a low dose and concentration and have a promising potential to be applied in the pharmaceutical and food industries.
TI  - Pneumonia in slaughtered sheep in south-western Iran: pathological characteristics and aerobic bacterial aetiology.
AB  - In this study, the lungs of 1,000 sheep carcasses were subjected to gross examination and those suspected to be infected with pneumonia were studied at histopathological level as well as examined for presence of bacteria. Pneumonia was detected in 42 (4.2%) carcasses. Based on histopathological lesions, 45.24% were affected with suppurative bronchopneumonia, 20.93% with interstitial pneumonia, 11.9% bronchointerstitial pneumonia, 7.14% with fibrinous bronchopneumonia and 2.38% with embolic pneumonia. In addition, 11.9% of the lungs showed lung abscesses and 2.33% were affected with pleuritis without involving pulmonary parenchyma. Bacteriological examination revealed presence of ovine pathogens, such as Pasteurella multocida (24.53%), Staphylococcus aureus (20.75%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.09%), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (7.55%) and Actinomyces pyogenes (1.89%). The most common form of pneumonia was suppurative bronchopneumonia with moderate amounts of fibrin deposits on the pleural surface and inside the bronchioles and alveoli.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Trends of SAPHO therapy: should we be content?
AB  - The interventional studies with bone biopsy of the SAPHO lesions and microbiological investigation are a significant addition to a long range of publications showing an association of SAPHO with Propionibacterium acnes. Infectious agents isolated from SAPHO patients have merited special attention for many years. Their possible etiological role is supported by the pathogen isolation from different sites: anterior chest wall, spine, synovial fluid, bone tissue, and skin pustules. A range of pathogens have been found, including Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilusparainfluenzae, actinomyces, and even Treponemapallidum. P. acnes is a much more frequent pathogen and plays a particular role. The article focus is to emphasize limited use of interventional method to verify infection ethology of SAPHO in publications last two years. Successful therapy may be really effective and eradicative on a basis of the pathogen identification.Randomized control studies are needed to confirm the effects of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of generalized aggressive and chronic periodontal  diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to distinguish between generalized aggressive (GAgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) based on the subgingival microbial profiles predominant in these diseases. METHODS: Two-hundred and sixty subjects, 75 with GAgP and 185 with CP were recruited. Full-mouth clinical measurements were recorded. Individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from 7 sites per subject and analyzed for the prevalence and levels of 51 species by chequerboard. Differences between groups were examined by the Mann-Whitney test. Associations between bacterial species and GAgP were examined by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces israelli, Eubacterium nodatum and Propionibacterium acnes were detected in significantly greater counts in GAgP, whereas Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Staphylococcus aureus and Veillonella parvula were more predominant in CP patients (adjusted p < 0.001). E. nodatum (at mean levels >/=4 x 10(5)) increased significantly the probability of a subject being diagnosed with GAgP than CP (OR 2.44 [0.96-6.20]), whereas P. gingivalis (OR 0.34 [0.11-0.93]) and T. denticola (OR 0.35 [0.11-0.94]) were associated with CP. CONCLUSIONS: Very few subgingival species differed in prevalence and/or levels between GAgP and CP in this sample population. In particular, E. nodatum was strongly related to GAgP, whereas P. gingivalis and T. denticola were associated with CP.
TI  - [Distribution and characteristics of soil antagonistic actinomycetes on northern  slope of Taibai Mountain, Qinling].
AB  - Twelve representative soil samples were collected from different altitudes on the northern slope of Taibai Mountain to study the distribution and characteristics of soil antagonistic actinomyces by using agar block method. There existed a great deal of soil antagonistic actinomyces in the study area. Among the 141 actinomycete strains isolated, 116 strains (82.3%) showed antagonism toward 12 target bacteria or fungi. The antagonistic strains at altitudes 800-1845, 3488, 3655, and 3670 m occupied 73.7% -86.8%, 81.3%, 78.9% and 82.3% of the total, respectively. 42.1% of the strains at altitudes 1200-2300 m and > 3400 m showed strong and broad spectrum antagonistic activity, suggesting that there was a great potential for the isolation of actinomycete strains with strong anti-biotic capability at these altitudes. 24.1% of the antagonistic actinomycetes showed antagonism against Staphyloccocus aureu, and 2.4%, 6.9% and 11.2% of them showed activity toward Verticillium dahliae in cotton, Phytophthora sp. in strawberry and Neonectria radiciccla in ginseng, respectively. This study showed that the soil actinomycete antagonistic potentiality (SAAP) could be used as a quantitative indicator to evaluate the potential of antagonistic actinomycete resources in soil.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin FimA mediate Actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  - By combining X-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of FimA, the shaft fimbrillin of Actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between Actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. The FimA adhesin is built with three IgG-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide bond, previously described in several Gram-positive pilins. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation, they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of FimA. Remarkably, FimA harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the Staphylococcus aureus Cna B domain. Each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. Thus, FimA should serve as an excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and Gram-positive fimbriae.
TI  - Primary chest wall abscess caused by Escherichia coli costochondritis.
AB  - Chest wall abscess may occur as primary infection or secondary to open trauma or  thoracic wall surgery. The authors describe an unusual case of Escherichia coli costochondritis occurring 2 months after a blunt chest wall trauma. Primary chest wall abscess due to E coli costochondritis has been previously reported only twice occurring after urinary tract infection. All other very few reports of E coli costochondritis have been reported only after thoracic surgical procedures. An English literature review of primary chest wall abscess showed that 4 pathogens are responsible for the majority of cases: Actinomyces, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Salmonella. C albicans costochondritis was most commonly reported among heroin addicts. The appearance of a growing chest wall mass should always prompt a search for an infectious cause, even with little or no systemic signs and symptoms.
TI  - Antimicrobial sesquiterpenoids from Laurus nobilis L.
AB  - Activity-guided fractionations of leaf extracts from Laurus nobilis L. led to the isolation of a known sesquiterpene lactone, deacetyl laurenobiolide (1). Compound 1 showed antimicrobial activity against periopathic pathogens (Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), opportunistic Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus). Furthermore, acetylation and cyclisation of deacetyl laurenobiolide (1) yielded laurenobiolide (2) and a new compound, (5S,6R,7S,8S,10R)-6,8-dihydroxyeudesma-4(15),11(13)-dien-12-oic acid 12,8-lactone (3), respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 also showed antimicrobial activities. All compounds 1-3 demonstrated growth inhibitory effects with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 31 to 1000 microg mL(-1). This is the first report of compounds 1-3 showing antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (SZ) to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC #25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC #29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC#25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC #27853), Candida albicans (ATCC #90028), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC #33277), Actinomyces israelii (ATCC #12102), and Prevotella intermedia (ATCC# 15032). SZ was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to MTA powder. The control group was MTA powder with no SZ. The antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed MTA specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. The amounts of silver ion release from MTA specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. The pH of MTA specimens was measured with a pH meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. MTA with 2% and 0.2% SZ specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for P. intermedia and A. israelii. MTA without SZ inhibited C. albicans, E. Coli, and P. intermedia. The highest silver release was detected in 2% SZ MTA at 24 h. The incorporation of SZ may enhance the antimicrobial activity of MTA.
TI  - Microbiologic results after non-surgical erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet laser or air-abrasive treatment of peri-implantitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and microbiologic effects of the non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis lesions using either an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (Er:YAG) laser or an air-abrasive subgingival polishing method. METHODS: In a 6-month clinical trial, 42 patients with peri-implantitis were treated at one time with an Er:YAG laser or an air-abrasive device. Routine clinical methods were used to monitor clinical conditions. Baseline and 6-month intraoral radiographs were assessed with a software program. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method was used to assess 74 bacterial species from the site with the deepest probing depth (PD) at the implant. Non-parametric tests were applied to microbiology data. RESULTS: PD reductions (mean +/- SD) were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm and 0.8 +/- 0.5 mm in the laser and air-abrasive groups, respectively (not significant). No baseline differences in bacterial counts between groups were found. In the air-abrasive group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus anaerobius were found at lower counts at 1 month after therapy (P <0.001) and with lower counts in the laser group for Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme (P = 0.002), and Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum (P = 0.002). Both treatments failed to reduce bacterial counts at 6 months. Porphyromonas gingivalis counts were higher in cases with progressive peri-implantitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: At 1 month, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. anaerobius were reduced in the air-abrasive group, and Fusobacterium spp. were reduced in the laser group. Six-month data demonstrated that both methods failed to reduce bacterial counts. Clinical improvements were limited.
TI  - Structure
AB  - All bacteria, both pathogenic and saprophytic, are unicellular organisms that reproduce by binary fission. Most bacteria are capable of independent metabolic existence and growth, but species of Chlamydia and Rickettsia are obligately intracellular organisms. Bacterial cells are extremely small and are most conveniently measured in microns (10-6 m). They range in size from large cells such as Bacillus anthracis (1.0 to 1.3 microm X 3 to 10 microm) to very small cells such as Pasteurella tularensis (0.2 X 0.2 to 0.7 microm) Mycoplasmas (atypical pneumonia group) are even smaller, measuring 0.1 to 0.2 microm in diameter. Bacteria therefore have a surface-to-volume ratio that is very high: about 100,000. Bacteria have characteristic shapes. The common microscopic morphologies are cocci (round or ellipsoidal cells, such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus, respectively); rods, such as Bacillus and Clostridium species; long, filamentous branched cells, such as Actinomyces species; and comma-shaped and spiral cells, such as Vibrio cholerae and Treponema pallidum, respectively. The arrangement of cells is also typical of various species or groups of bacteria (Fig. 2-1). Some rods or cocci characteristically grow in chains; some, such as Staphylococcus aureus, form grapelike clusters of spherical cells; some round cocci form cubic packets. Bacterial cells of other species grow separately. The microscopic appearance is therefore valuable in classification and diagnosis. The higher resolving power of the electron microscope not only magnifies the typical shape of a bacterial cell but also clearly resolves its prokaryotic organization (Fig. 2-2).
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Identification of a bioactive compound isolated from Brazilian propolis type 6.
AB  - A prenylated benzophenone, hyperibone A, was isolated from the hexane fraction of Brazilian propolis type 6. Its structure was determined by spectral analysis including 2D NMR. This compound exhibited cytotoxic activity against HeLa tumor cells (IC(50)=0.1756microM), strong antimicrobial activity (MIC range-0.73-6.6microg/mL; MBC range-2.92-106microg/mL) against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus oralis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Actinomyces naeslundii, and the results of its cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities were considered good.
TI  - Cutaneous granular bacteriosis, a rarely diagnosed infection of the head and the  neck.
AB  - A young man presented with a large multilobulated and mutilating tumour of the scalp, which had been relapsing for years. Histological examination of a biopsy from the lesion revealed chronic inflammation with granulation tissue and presence of granules with eosinophilic periphery, which was positive for Gram, Grocott and periodic-acid-Schiff stains. A large excision was performed. Cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was treated with penicillin G, but 4 weeks after the start of treatment, new small nodules appeared over the same area. All these new nodules disappeared within 2 weeks the addition of clindamycin and cotrimoxazole. This triple antibiotic treatment was carried on for 18 months, and the patient remained disease-free after a follow-up of 4 years. Although the lesions were clinically and histologically suggestive of actinomycosis, culture revealed that they were caused by a completely different organism. We suggest grouping such lesions under a single term "granular bacteriosis" and combining surgery with broad-spectrum antibiotics covering Actinomyces species and botryomycosis-causing organisms (mainly Staphylococcus).
TI  - Pathological and bacteriological studies of hydrosalpinx in buffaloes.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to investigate the bacteria accompanying hydrosalpinx of the buffalo cow and investigate the correlation between bacterial infection of the uterus and hydrosalpinx. Buffalo cows' reproductive tracts were collected from Mosul abattoir. A total 385 uterine samples were examined of which 25 were having hydrosalpinx. Swabs for bacteriology, fluid for cytology and biopsies for histopathology were collected from the hydrosalpinx and the uterus from each samples included in this study. Results of this study indicated high prevalence of hydrosalpinx (6.5%) including unilateral (n = 19; 76%) and bilateral (n = 6; 24%) hydrosalpinx. Although 16 samples (64%) of the hydrosalpinx samples had no bacterial growth, the most prevalent bacteria recovered from hydrosalpinx were Corynebacterium hemolyticum and Actinomyces bovis, 42.8% and 28.6%, respectively. The most prevalent bacteria in the uterus were Archanobacterium pyogenes (18.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.8%), and Listeria monocytogenes (11.0%). Higher rates of leukocytes infiltration (p < 0.01) were observed in the uterine discharge than hydrosalpinx. A significant (p < 0.01) increase in lymphocytes was found in uterine discharge. Microscopic examination of the hydrosalpinx showed mucosal atrophy and dilatation of oviductal lumen without any signs of inflammation. It could be concluded that there is no correlation between bacteria isolated from uterus and hydrosalpinx. No association was found between bacteriological cultures and hydrosalpinx. Inflammation of the uterine tissue could be extended to utero-tubal junction producing local inflammation resulting in fibrosis and tubal obstruction. The obstruction in the lumen of the oviducts resulted in accumulation of fluid.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) monomers on bacteria associated with oral infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt monomers in order to evaluate their potential applications as dental materials. In vitro susceptibility testing of the monomers was performed by the broth dilution method on bacteria associated with oral infections: Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 15987, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393. The time-kill kinetics of the monomer with relatively higher antibacterial activity against S. mutans were also investigated. It was found that all the tested bacteria strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which methacryloxylethyl cetyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-CB) exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations, ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 microg/ml. The time-kill curve showed that DMAE-CB achieved 99.44% killing at 19.2 microg/ml (4 times the minimal bactericidal concentration) against S. mutans after 1 min and 100% killing within 10 min of contact. This result indicates that the quaternary ammonium salt monomer DMAE-CB may be a candidate antibacterial agent for incorporation into dental restorative materials.
TI  - Effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  - We have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (ESWT) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar bone lost through periodontal disease. The objective of the present study was to determine any antibacterial effect of ESWT on oral bacteria. Monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of ESWT at energy flux densities (EFD) of 0.12 mJ/mm(2), 0.22 mJ/mm(2), and 0.3 mJ/mm(2). Following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. ESWT showed a significant microbicidal effect for Streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of Porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mJ/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). In addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower EFDs. No significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at EFDs and pulses tested (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that low-energy ESWT may be bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Empyema necessitatis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: case report and review of the literature.
AB  - Empyema necessitatis is a rare complication of empyema in which the pleural infection spreads outside of the pleural space to involve the soft tissues of the chest wall. Most cases of empyema necessitatis are related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and, less commonly, to Actinomyces spp. and Streptococcus spp. Staphylococcus aureus has rarely been reported as the causative agent of empyema necessitatis, with the majority of S. aureus isolates being methicillin sensitive. Only two cases of empyema necessitatis due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have been reported in the medical literature. We report the case of a 59-year-old Caucasian male who presented to our institution with complaints of pain in and swelling of his left upper chest of 2-months duration. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed an 8.1- by 6.5-cm lesion which extended from the left upper lobe of the lung into the extrathoracic soft tissues beneath the left upper pectoralis muscle. A wedge resection of the left upper lung lobe revealed lung tissue with an organized pneumonia-like pattern associated with marked acute pleuritis. Blood and urine cultures and cultures of the left chest soft tissue mass grew MRSA. The patient was successfully treated with vancomycin followed by a 10-day outpatient course of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. This case represents an extremely rare manifestation of an increasingly dangerous bacterial pathogen.
TI  - A study on the pathological lesions of oviducts of buffaloes diagnosed at postmortem.
AB  - The aims of this study were to study the prevalence of oviduct abnormalities of buffaloes, investigate bacteria accompanying hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx and salpingitis. In addition, the study was designed to investigate the correlation between bacterial infection of the uterus and oviduct lesions in buffaloes. Bacteriological examinations were performed on hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx and salpingitis. Hydrosalpinx was found in 28 (6.9%) cases of which 20 (71.4%) were found unilaterally and 8 (28.6%) bilaterally. Pyosalpinx was recorded in 12 (2.9%). Three cases (0.7%) of oviducts filled with blood were recorded. Obstruction of oviducts was recorded in 5 (1.2%). Adhesions between mesosalpinx and perisalpingeal tissues were observed in 7 (1.7) cases. One case of double oviduct was found in the left side of the tract examined. The most prevalent bacteria recovered from hydrosalpinx were Corynebacterium hemolyticum and Actinomyces bovis, 42.8% and 28.6%, respectively. No correlation was noticed between bacteria isolated from the uterus and hydrosalpinx. The most prevalent bacteria recovered from pyosalpinx were Escherichia coli, Archanobacterium pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, 33.3%, 26.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Higher rates of leukocyte infiltration (P < 0.01) were observed in the uterine discharge and pyosalpinx than hydrosalpinx. In a conclusion, the current study disclosed that oviductal lesions seem to be an important problem in buffalo cows. In addition, there is no correlation between bacteria isolated from uterus and hydrosalpinx. There is a high correlation between bacteria isolated from uterus and pyosalpinx and salpingitis. The occurrence of pyosalpinx and salpingitis is mainly due to bacterial infection. Bacterial isolates from pyosalpinx and salpingitis might be related to ascending infection from the uterus.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Tannerella forsythia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. The present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. METHODS: Subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. Bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. RESULTS: A total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. Gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). Periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for Actinomyces neuii, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Corynebacterium pseudogenitalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella bivia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P <0.001 for each). Higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (BOP not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (P <0.001) including Lactobacillus iners, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella bivia, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that P. aeruginosa (P <0.001) and T. forsythia (P <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. The odds ratio of having P. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; P <0.001). CONCLUSION: In addition to P. gingivalis and T. forsythia, a diverse microbiota, including P. aeruginosa, P. endodontalis, P. bivia, and S. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.
TI  - Normal ocular flora in healthy eyes from a rural population in Sierra Leone.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the normal conjunctival flora in a rural population in Sierra Leone and compare the normal ocular flora of a developing country with that of the developed world. METHODS: Conjunctival swabs obtained from healthy right eyes of 276 residents of Masungbo, Sierra Leone, were analyzed for growth of microorganisms. RESULTS: The most commonly isolated organisms from conjunctival swabs of healthy eyes were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (28.6%), fungus (26.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (19.9%), Gram negatives other than Pseudomonas/Haemophilus (9.8%), Nocardia/Actinomyces (6.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of fungal and bacterial colonization of healthy eyes in a rural population of Sierra Leone. A relationship may exist between resident normal flora and the etiology of ocular infections.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological analysis of subjects treated with Branemark or AstraTech implants: a 7-year follow-up study.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the impact of different implant systems on the clinical conditions and the microbiota at implants, and whether the presence of bacteria at tooth sites was predictive of the presence at implant sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with either AstraTech or Branemark in function for 7 years were enrolled. Sub-gingival bacterial samples at tooth and implant sites were collected with sterile endodontic paper points, and analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method (40 species). RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects, 27 supplied with AstraTech (n=132 implants) and 27 with Branemark (n=102) implants, were studied. Test tooth sites had significantly less evidence of bleeding on probing (P<0.001) and presence of plaque (P<0.001) than implant test sites. Implant sites presented with deeper probing pocket depth than tooth sites (mean difference: 1.1 mm, standard error of differences: 0.08, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.9-1.3, P<0.001). Tannerella forsythia (P<0.05), Capnocytophaga sputigena (P<0.05), Actinomyces israelii (P<0.05) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (P<0.05) were found at higher levels at tooth surfaces. No differences in bacterial load for any species were found between the two implant systems. The odds of being present/absent at tooth and implants sites were only significant for Staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (OR): 5.2 : 1, 95% CI: 1.4-18.9, P<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: After 7 years in function, implants presented with deeper probing depths than teeth. S. aureus was commonly present at both teeth and implants sites. S. aureus at tooth sites was predictive of also being present at implant sites.
TI  - [Psoas abscess of the adult: study of 38 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to report the clinical aspects, the etiologies, the treatment and the evolution of the psoas abscess in the adult. METHODS: Our retrospective study concerns 38 cases of psoas abscesses collected in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Sfax (Tunisia), over a period of 16 years (January 1990 - December 2005). RESULTS: The average age is 44 years (extremes: 16-76 years). The sex-ratio is 1.4. Six patients were diabetics and one had a chronic renal injury at the stage of hemodialysis. The clinical manifestations were: a fever (76.4%), an abdomino-pelvic ache (84.2%) and a psoitis (34.2%). All patients had a biologic inflammatory syndrome with a hyperleucocytosis in 28 cases. The abscess was one-sided in 29 cases and bilateral in 9 cases. After microbiological study and/or histological study, pathogens were identified in 31 patients, they were Staphylococcus aureus (10 cases), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1 case), Streptococci (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Bacteroides fragilis (1 case), Actinomyces (2 cases), Brucella (3 cases), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (8 cases) and Candida glabrata (1 case). The psoas abscess was primary in 10 cases and secondary in 28 cases. All the patients received an antibiotherapy or an antifungal therapy adapted to the micro-organism in cause, with a drainage of the abscess in 25 cases (surgical in 9 cases and percutaneous in 16 cases). The evolution was favourable in 36 cases. One patient presented recurrences and one patient died. CONCLUSION: The psoas abscess of the adult is characterized by a polymorphe clinical presentation. Germs in cause are very variable.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - Activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. Unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. To address this problem, we have examined the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. We demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mPE), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and Candida species found in oral infections. Since Streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against S. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. Our results indicate that mPE can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. Incubation with 5 nM mPE prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nM mPE reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. Structure-function analyses suggest that mPE inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds DNA at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular antibiotic, similar to other AMPs. We conclude that mPE and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - Induced production of emericellamides A and B from the marine-derived fungus Emericella sp. in competing co-culture.
AB  - Induction of the production of emericellamides A and B (1, 2), by the marine-derived fungus Emericella sp., was observed during co-culture with the marine actinomycete Salinispora arenicola. The planar structures of these new cyclic depsipeptides, which incorporate 3-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyldecanoic acid and 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyldodecanoic acid, were assigned by combined chemical and spectral methods. The absolute configurations of the amino acids, and those of the chiral centers on the side chain, were established by application of the Marfey's method, by J-based configuration analysis, and by application of the modified Mosher method. Emericellamides A and B show modest antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 3.8 and 6.0 microM, respectively.
TI  - Association between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens in the dental  plaque of elderly individuals.
AB  - Opportunistic infections in the oral cavity of the elderly may increase the incidence of systemic disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the oral bacterial flora between dependent elderly (inpatients) and independent elderly (community-dwelling residents). After multiple variables were taken into account, inpatients had significantly lower detection rates than community-dwelling residents for alpha-streptococci (p < 0.001) and Neisseria (p 0.004), and higher detection rates for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p 0.024), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (p 0.011) and Actinomyces spp. (p 0.005). Among inpatients, the requirement for a high degree of care was related negatively to detection of alpha-streptococci, but was related significantly to detection of P. aeruginosa (p 0.018) or MRSA (p 0.004). Tube-fed inpatients had a significantly lower detection rate for alpha-streptococci (p 0.041) and a higher detection rate for P. aeruginosa (p 0.004) than those who did not require tube feeding. Inpatients with a history of antibiotic use had a significantly lower detection rate for alpha-streptococci (p 0.049) and a higher detection rate for MRSA (p 0.007) than those without a history of antibiotic use. The detection rates for P. aeruginosa or MRSA in inpatients without alpha-streptococci were higher than in inpatients with alpha-streptococci after controlling for age and gender (P. aeruginosa, p 0.006; MRSA, p 0.001). Overall, detection of alpha-streptococci had an inverse correlation with the detection of P. aeruginosa and MRSA in the oral cavity and is likely to be an indicator of pathogenic bacterial infection.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175), S. mutans (Ingbritt), Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 393), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Candida albicans (ATCC 90028). The results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (F=38.290; P<0.01). The six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. Among them, Longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by ZnO whisker antibacterial complex (ZnOw) AT-83, IONPURE-H, basic magnesium hypochlorite, ZnOw AT-88 and Antim-AMS2. The broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and resistance-modifying activities of aqueous crude khat  extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (Catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. DESIGN: Lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. The agar dilution method of the NCCLS was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of 20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. Slight growth was defined as marked growth reduction (MGR). The E-test was used to determine the MICs of tetracycline and penicillin-G for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-MIC of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). RESULTS: Eighteen strains (55%) were sensitive to the extracts (MICs 5-20 mg/ml). Most of these were periodontal pathogens with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (MIC 5-10mg/ml). Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. Except for Lactobacillus acidophilus that showed MGR at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. The extracts were active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC 10-20 mg/ml) but not against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. The presence of the khat extracts at a sub-MIC resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: Khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. There is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. Further investigation is needed to identify the active components and assess their clinical relevance.
TI  - Use of shell-vial cell culture assay for isolation of bacteria from clinical specimens: 13 years of experience.
AB  - The shell-vial culture assay is performed routinely in our laboratory. Recently we revisited our experience of using the shell-vial culture assay for the isolation of microorganisms from various clinical samples. Over a 13-year period, we have isolated 580 bacterial strains (5%) from 11,083 clinical samples tested. Over the same period, 285 isolates of rickettsiae, bartonellae, or Coxiella burnetii were cultured from a total of 7,102 samples tested. These isolates include 55 Rickettsia sp. isolates, 95 Coxiella burnetii isolates, and 135 Bartonella sp. isolates. Based on our experience with the growth of fastidious microorganisms, we have used a centrifugation shell-vial technique called JNSP, for "je ne sais pas" ("I don't know [what I am growing]") for the isolation of other microorganisms. A total of 173 isolates were cultured from the 3,861 clinical samples tested using the JNSP method. Of these, 40 isolates had not been grown before on usual axenic medium. These include 2 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 7 isolates of Streptococcus sp. and related genera, 6 Mycobacterium sp. isolates, 1 Nocardia asteroides isolate, 1 Actinomyces sp. isolate, 1 Brucella melitensis isolate, 2 Francisella tularensis isolates, 1 Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolate, and 1 Legionella pneumophila isolate. Using this protocol, we have also cultured intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia trachomatis and we have performed the first culture and establishment of Trophyrema whipplei. Applied in our laboratory, the shell-vial culture generally exhibits a low rate of success. However, in some cases, this technique allowed microbial diagnosis when classical agar procedure and PCR were negative.
TI  - A case of polymicrobial endocarditis caused by anaerobic organisms in an injection drug user.
AB  - Endocarditis is a serious complication of injection drug use most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. We report a case of tricuspid valve polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis in an injection drug user from 3 oral anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolytica, Veillonella species, and Prevotella melaninogenica. The patient was believed to have acquired these organisms from his habit of licking the needle in order to gauge the strength of the cocaine prior to injection. The patient was successfully treated with a 6-week course of penicillin G and metronidazole. This case demonstrates the importance of a detailed history in designing empiric therapy.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyse the microbial flora in specific sites in 20 dentate (> or = 16 teeth) subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin and in 20 controls matched according to age, sex and number of teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial samples were analysed for the following micro-organisms: mutans streptococci, Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp., associated with the development of caries, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis, frequently found in elevated numbers in periodontitis sites and Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, enterics and enterococci, associated with mucosal infections. The total microbial count was also registered, together with the total number of streptococci, associated with good oral health. RESULTS: In the hyposalivation group, the mean age was 54 +/- 8 years and the mean number of teeth 25 +/- 3. The unstimulated secretion rate was 0.04 +/- 0.04 mL/min and the stimulated secretion rate 0.98 +/- 0.51 mL/min. Compared with the controls, the hyposalivation group tended to harbour a lower number and proportion of F. nucleatum on the tongue, and an increased number of enterococci in the vestibular region. In the supragingival plaque, the numbers of Strepococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased and the number of C. albicans tended to be increased. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin have a supragingival plaque associated with the development of caries.
TI  - Feline pyothorax: a retrospective study of 27 cases in Australia.
AB  - Pyothorax was diagnosed in 27 cats between 1983 and 2002. In 21 (78%) of the cases, pleural fluid culture and/or cytology was consistent with a mixed anaerobic bacterial infection of oropharyngeal origin. In six cases (22%), infection was caused by unusual pathogens or pathogens of non-oropharyngeal origin, including a Mycoplasma species, Cryptococcus gattii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The overall mortality rate was 22%. Treatment was successful in 18 of 19 cases (95%) where closed thoracostomy tubes were inserted. One case resolved only after thoracotomy. Actinomyces species were isolated in three cases and in contrast to dogs where thoracotomy is recommended, they were resolved with tube thoracostomy. Mechanical complications occurred in 58% of the cats with indwelling chest tubes. Probable mechanisms of pleural space infection were identified in 18 cats (67%) including haematogenous infection (n=1), direct inoculation of bacteria into the pleural space (n=1), intrathoracic oesophageal rupture (n=1) and parapneumonic extension of infection (n=15; 56%). Of the latter, perioperative aspiration was suspected in two cats, parasitic migration in two and antecedent upper respiratory tract infection was implicated in seven. Parapneumonic spread of infection after colonisation and invasion of lung tissue by oropharyngeal flora appears to be the most frequent cause of feline anaerobic polymicrobial pyothorax and contests the widespread belief that direct inoculation of pleural cavity by bite wounds is more common.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: Endo Fill, Endomethasone, Endomethasone N, Sealer 26 and AH-Plus, against the following microorganisms: Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces naeslundii. The sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.The direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. The results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, Endo-Fill and Endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. Sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. At all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. In conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon the microbial susceptibility to them.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  - The purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) against Actinomyces odontolyticus (ATCC17982), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC2586), Streptococcus sanguis (ATCC10556), Enterococcus faecalis (ER3/2S), Escherichia coli (SM10lambdapir), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (UME), and Candida albicans (ATCC10261). Two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. MTA (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees C as required for microbial growth. A blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. All MTA samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. MTA/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). In conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity on oral pathogens among six types of nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To Compare the antibacterial activity on oral pathogens among six types of nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents. METHODS: The oral pathogens selected were Streptococcus mutans(ATCC6715),Lactobacillus (ATCC4356),Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC19246), Candida Albicans (ATCC76615), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923), Escherichia coli (ATCCC25922). Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined by Liquid dilution method. RESULTS: Nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents had fine bactericidal activity against oral pathogens. The general antibacterial activity of six types were nearly equal. CONCLUSION: It is possible that nano-silver base inorganic antibacterial agents can be used in dental antibacterial materials.
TI  - Effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of Staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  - Vesicles from the outer membrane of Porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of Streptococcus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Actinomyces viscosus. We found that in the presence of P. gingivalis vesicles, Staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with Streptococcus spp., and the mycelium-type Candida albicans, but not the yeast type. Autoaggregation of S. aureus in the presence of P. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by L-arginine, L-lysine, and L-cysteine. Both the methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) strains of S. aureus were able to coaggregate with Streptococcus spp., A. naeslundii, and A. viscosus when they were treated with P. gingivalis vesicles. P. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type C. albicans coaggregated with S. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. These results indicate that strains of S. aureus, including MRSA, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when P. gingivalis is present.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  - We studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. We recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. Aerobes only were recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). Among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were Streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), Corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), Staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), Moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), Hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group C beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). Among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of Peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), Prevotella (22 [25.3%]), Actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), Propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), Fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and Veillonella (1 [1.1%]). Beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). We found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. Our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of 'MGP' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To determine whether 'MGP' gutta-percha (Westport, CT, USA), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. METHODOLOGY: Inocula of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'MGP' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees C aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. Identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. Following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'MGP' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. RESULTS: Povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. Iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited S. sanguis and A. odontolyticus. 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited S. aureus, S. sanguis, A. odontolyticus and F. nucleatum. Neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'MGP' gutta-percha inhibited growth of E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'MGP' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on S. aureus and F. nucleatum, but not on E. faecalis, E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Crowding and winter emergency feeding as predisposing factors for kerato-conjunctivitis in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway.
AB  - Due to the hard environmental and climatic situation in late winter 1999, a herd  of about 200 free-ranging, semi-domesticated reindeer was gathered in a paddock in northern Norway for emergency feeding. About the same number of reindeer was not corralled but supplementary fed on their winter pastures. The fodder was of relatively good quality but very dusty and fed in a very dry environment. Six weeks later, an outbreak of eye-infection was diagnosed in one third of the corralled reindeer; mild symptoms were observed in most of them, but 11 animals showed severe signs of disease. No signs of disease were found in the non-corralled animals. Ten reindeer died through emaciation, the eleventh was sacrificed. Histopathological diagnosis of two severely affected eyes revealed a severe purulent kerato-conjunctivitis with bacteria and plant particles embedded in purulent exudates on the cornea and conjunctiva. In one eye from the two most affected animals Actinomyces pyogenes, coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Escherichia coli and in the other one Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were found. The bacteria encountered in this study are not considered the primary cause of disease. They seem rather to be opportunistic infectious agents of eyes that have been irritated mechanically through exposure to dusty fodder in a dry environment. The stress through unfamiliar corralling of the reindeer, that followed an insufficient fodder supply, could be considered as an additional infection supporting factor. This case-report emphasises on the importance of different factors involved in favouring outbreaks of disease in reindeer, under intensified husbandry conditions. Even though crowding and emergency feeding may be, at certain circumstances, the only means of survival for reindeer, a negative impact of implied crowding diseases on their productivity, must be considered, as well.
TI  - Some new aspects of the pathology, pathogenesis, and aetiology of disseminated lung lesions in slaughter pigs.
AB  - From 40 pigs rejected for human consumption at slaughter due to an apparent presence of pyemic lung lesions (defined as disseminated processes containing pus and/or necrotic material), the lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys were subjected to an extended macroscopic examination. Several lung lesions were sampled from each animal for histological and bacteriological examination. Samples from the kidneys and spleens were also subjected to bacteriological examination. At gross level, four groups of lung lesions were identified: 1) disseminated foci with contents of pus and/or necrotic material (n=26); 2) disseminated or multifocally located ecchymoses with a central area of fibroplasia (n=9); 3) non-pneumonic lesions, i.e., disseminated areas of atelectasis (n=1) or haemorrhagic areas developing due to the process of slaughter (n=1); and 4) suppurative lesions without a disseminated distribution pattern (n=3). Histologically, the disseminated suppurative/necrotic foci were identified as: A) abscesses (n=10); B) necrotic lesions (n=6); and C) ectatic or ectatic-like bronchioles with contents of pus and necrotic material (n=10). The macroscopic observation of disseminated centres of fibroplasia with peripheral ecchymoses (n=9) was confirmed histopathologically. The livers of five pigs contained multiple areas of chronic interstitial fibrosis related to migration of Ascaris suum larvae ("milk spotted liver"). Such hepatic lesions were significantly (p<0.01) related to the simultaneous occurrence of disseminated pulmonary ecchymoses with a central area of fibroplasia. Generally, all lung lesions of each individual animal contained identical monocultures of bacteria following this pattern: Staphylococcus aureus (abscesses); Actinomyces hyovaginalis (necroses); S. aureus, A. hyovaginalis, and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (ectatic and ectatic-like bronchioles). Areas with fibrosis were sterile or contained bacteria considered to be a result of contamination. Apart from one kidney, from which S. aureus was cultured, all other organs were sterile. It is concluded that difficulties exist in differentiating pulmonary pyemic lesions from non-pyemic lesions at the gross level. Thus, it was not possible to distinguish between abscesses/necroses and ectatic bronchioles, the pathogenesis of the latter being uncertain. However, the chronic non-pyemic lesions related to the migration of A. suum larvae should be identified by the absence of pus/necrosis. S. aureus was predominantly isolated from abscesses, whereas, and most surprisingly, A. hyovaginalis was the dominant bacterium isolated from the pulmonary necroses.
TI  - Actinomyces hyovaginalis associated with disseminated necrotic lung lesions in slaughter pigs.
AB  - Lungs from 26 slaughter pigs with a diagnosis of pyaemic lung lesions (disseminated necrotic lesions and abscesses), as determined at post-mortem meat inspection, were subjected to a thorough examination, including re-evaluation of gross pathology and histopathological and microbiological examination of samples from multiple lesions. The pulmonary lesions, which appeared identical on gross inspection, could be divided into three histopathological types, namely (1) abscesses, (2) circumscribed (contained) necrotic lesions, and (3) bronchiolar ectasias. Some characteristic relations between bacterial species and histopathological type were demonstrated. Thus, abscesses were dominated by Staphylococcus aureus infections, and circumscribed (contained) necrotic lesions were dominated by infections with an Actinomyces species, identified as Actinomyces hyovaginalis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Actinomyces hyovaginalis was demonstrated in 23% of all cases, pointing to this organism as an important agent of disseminated lung lesions of pigs. Furthermore, a characteristic pyogranulomatous reaction with a central area of necrosis was found to be associated with this infection.
TI  - Bovine mastitis in selected areas of southern Ethiopia.
AB  - A study on bovine mastitis, designed to determine the causal agents, prevalence of infection and impact of risk factors in three cattle breeds, was conducted in selected areas of southern Ethiopia. A total of 307 lactating and non-lactating cows, of which 162 were indigenous Zebu, 85 Jersey and 60 Holstein-Friesian. were examined by clinical examination and the California mastitis (CMT) test. Of these, 40.4% were positive by CMT and bacteriology for clinical or subclinical mastitis, with prevalence rates of 37.1% and 62.9%, respectively. Out of 1133 quarters examined, 212 (18.7%) were found to be infected, 83 (39.21%) clinically and 129 (60.8%) subclinically. The prevalence of mastitis was significantly higher in Holstein-Friesian than in indigenous Zebu, in non-lactating cows than in lactating cows, in the early lactation stage than in the mid-lactation stage, in cows with lesions and/or tick infestation on skin of udder and/or teats than in cows without this factor, and in the wet season than in the dry season. Mastitis increased with parity number (R = 0.9). Of 248 CMT and clinically positive udder quarter samples analysed microbiologically, 212 were culturally positive for known mastitis pathogens and 36 were negative. Of the 199 positive samples. Staphylococcus accounted for 39.2%. Streptococcus for 23.6%, coliforms for 14.1%, Micrococcus and Bacillus species for 8.0% each and Actinomyces or Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) for 7.0%. It was concluded that there was a high prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli, in this study area.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Factors Optimizing the Use of Subcutaneous Vascular Access Ports in Weaned Pigs.
AB  - Young, recently weaned pigs were implanted with subcutaneous vascular access ports in experiments designed to determine the relative bioavailability of lead from contaminated soils. In nine experiments, a total of 72 subcutaneous vascular access ports were implanted. Complications were observed in 38.9% of the implanted pigs. Changes in the protocol were implemented in an effort to reduce the rate of complications. The majority of complications were septic processes, including localized infections around the site of the catheter and injection port, hematogenous pulmonary abscessation, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. Staphylococcus aureus, S. hyicus, b-hemolytic Streptococcus species, and Actinomyces pyogenes were cultured from septic processes in these pigs. Our findings suggest that the health of the skin at the time of surgery, the experience of the surgeon, and the immunologic status of the animal influence the risk of septic complications in pigs implanted with subcutaneous vascular access ports.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Humoral immunity host factors in subjects with failing or successful titanium dental implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with titanium dental implants is in general successful. However, an unknown number of implants do not integrate and are removed either by exfoliation or at the time of second stage surgery. It would be of importance to identify subjects at risk and predict early implant failure. METHODS: In a retrospective study serum IgG antibody titers and avidity in sera from 40 subjects who had experienced titanium dental implant treatments with non-osseo-integration as the outcome (NOTI) and in sera from 40 age and gender matched control subjects who had received successful titanium dental implants (SOTI) were studied. Serum IgG titers to whole cell Actinomyces viscosus, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus intermedius sonicated antigen preparations were studied by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum IgG antibody titers to S. aureus were significantly higher in subjects with SOTI than in NOTI (p<0.001) suggesting that higher titers indicate protection against implant failure as a result of S. aureus infection. Statistically significant higher serum IgG antibody avidity to P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were found in subjects with SOTI than in subjects with NOTI (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Statistical analysis failed to demonstrate antibody titer or avidity differences to the other pathogens studied. The likelihood that SOTI was associated with a high OD reading for S. aureus was 13.1:1 (p<0.001). Whether subjects were edentulous or not, or if they had lost teeth because of periodontitis or caries did not seem to matter. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG antibodies relative to B. forsythus, P. gingivalis and S. aureus may be associated with the outcome of implant procedures and explain why early implant failures occur.
TI  - Epidemiology of infectious keratoconjunctivitis in cattle in south-east Ethiopia.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of infectious keratoconjunctivitis on cross-breed dairy farms and to evaluate factors that influence its distribution. A total of 11 dairy farms and one cattle cross-breeding farm in different parts of Arsi region, south-east Ethiopia were clinically and bacteriologically investigated from February 1989 to December 1990. Out of 5221 local zebu and cross-breed dairy animals, 110 were found to have different degrees of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis. Of these, 94 (85.5%) were unilateral and 16 (14.5%) were bilateral. The prevalence of the disease was significantly (P < 0.001) influenced by age and breed; high exotic blood level and younger age groups were mainly affected. However, severity of the disease was not significantly associated with age (P > 0.750). Moraxella bovis was isolated from 88 (80%) of the 110 bacteriologically positive cases. Of these isolates, 61 (69%) were haemolytic and 27 (31%) were non-haemolytic strains. Infection with M. bovis was unilateral. Concurrent infections with M. bovis included Actinomyces pyogenes 23 (21%), Staphylococcus aureus 17 (15%), Pasteurella haemolytica nine (8%), Escherichia coli eight (7%) and Proteus spp. four (3.6%).
TI  - Dot assay for determining adhesive interactions between yeasts and bacteria under controlled hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  - Candida belongs to the normal human microflora and are found adhering to a number of human body tissues as well as to a variety of biomaterials implants. Often, yeasts adhere in association with bacteria, but to date there is no definitive assay to investigate adhesive interactions between yeasts and bacteria adhering on surfaces. Although we recently described the use of a parallel plate flow chamber to this purpose [Millsap, K.W., Bos, R., Van der Mei, H. C., Busscher, H.J., 1998. Adhesive interactions between medically important yeasts and bacteria. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 21, 321-336], the method was slow and evaluation of a large number of strains showed major biological variation between experiments. Here, we describe a new assay for the simultaneous determination of the adhesive interactions between yeasts and different bacterial strains on a surface under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. On an acrylic surface, the presence of adhering bacteria suppressed adhesion of Candida albicans ATCC 10261 to various degrees, depending on the bacterial strain involved. Suppression of C. albicans ATCC 10261 adhesion was strongest by Actinomyces naeslundii T14V-J1, while adhering Streptococcus gordonii NCTC 7869 caused the weakest suppression of yeast adhesion. When adhering yeasts and bacteria were challenged with the high detachment force of a passing liquid-air interface, the majority of the yeasts detached, while C. albicans adhering on the control, bare polymethylmethacrylate surface formed aggregates. Summarizing, this study presents a new method to determine suggested adhesive interactions between yeasts and adhering bacteria under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. However, the results seem to indicate that these adhesive interactions may well not exist, but that instead different bacterial strains have varying abilities to discourage yeast adhesion.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and Arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  - Arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. They possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. Although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Arnica has not been extensively investigated. Therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by Arnica and propolis extracts. Arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from Minas Gerais State were compared with controls. Fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: Candida albicans--NTCC 3736, F72; Staphylococcus aureus--ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis--ATCC 29212; Streptococcus sobrinus 6715; Strep. sanguis--ATCC 10556; Strep. cricetus--HS-6; Strep. mutans--Ingbritt 1600; Strep. mutans--OMZ 175; Actinomyces naeslundii--ATCC 12104, W 1053; Act. viscosus OMZ 105; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Porph. endodontalis and Prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. To assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. To assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 M sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees C in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. Arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. The propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for Actinomyces spp. The Arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. Cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. The Arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for Strep. mutans and 15% for Strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same concentrations. Thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the Arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.
TI  - Diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome in two sisters.
AB  - Two sisters with diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible and the humerus and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO syndrome) are presented. The diagnoses of diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis at the age of 12 years and 27 years, respectively, were based on typical medical history, clinical symptoms and radiographic, histologic and scintigraphic findings. Because skin lesions and scintigraphic enhancement of the sternoclavicular joints with hyperostosis were present, a SAPHO syndrome was diagnosed in both sisters. Microbiological cultures of biopsy specimens revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus at the humerus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Veilonella species at the mandible. Repeated operative procedures, including decortications, resection and reconstruction, and multiple histologic and microbiologic studies were performed over a period of up to 20 years. Since HLA typing yielded identical gene loci, we suggest that hereditary and autoimmune factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of these cases.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Ecological approach of macrolide-lincosamides-streptogramin producing actinomyces from Cuban soils.
AB  - We report in this study the frequency of Streptomyces strains to produce macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics isolated from Cuban soils. The screening assay is based on the induction of MLS-resistance phenotype in a clinical isolated strain of Staphylococcus aureus S-18. Our results suggest that of 800 Streptomyces strains isolated from different soil samples, 6% were positives in the screening test used. The ferralitic red soil from Pinar del Rio (north) provided the major percentage (3.6%) of MLS producing strains. The other soil samples tested belonging to Guira de Melena and Bauta in Havana, Matanzas City, Topes De Collantes (Villa Clara), and Soroa Mountains (Pinar del Rio) hill reached very low percentages.
TI  - Nine cases of idiopathic toxic epidermal necrolysis in cattle in Israel.
AB  - Nine sporadic cases of apparent toxic epidermal necrolysis in nine cattle herds in Israel are presented. The clinical symptoms were characterized by full-thickness epidermal exfoliation. No underlying disease or drug administration could be detected in the affected animals, and so all cases were classified as idiopathic. Recovery was noted in all affected animals. The clinical and histological findings are discussed in the light of the pertinent literature.
TI  - Microbiological understandings and mysteries of noma (cancrum oris).
AB  - The microbiologic history of noma was reviewed. Studies have associated the disease process with large numbers of fusiform bacilli and spirochetal organisms. In order to study the microbiology of the staging and infection periods of noma 62 Nigerian children, aged 3-14 years, 22 children had acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) and were also malnourished, 20 exhibited no acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis but were malnourished and 20 were free of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and in good nutritional state) were evaluated for the presence of viruses and oral microorganisms. The ANUG cases in the malnourished children had a higher incidence of Herpesviridae, the main virus being detected was cytomegalovirus. There were more anaerobic microorganisms recovered, with Prevotella intermedia as the predominant isolate, in the malnourished children as compared to the healthy children. A study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma lesions was carried out in eight noma patients, 3-15 years of age, in Sokoto State, northwestern Nigeria. Fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from 87.5% of the noma lesions. Oral microorganisms isolated included Prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and Actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0, 50.0 and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. All strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of P. intermedia which showed resistance to penicillin. The pathogenic mechanisms of F. necrophorum as a trigger organism were discussed. The isolation from human noma lesions of F. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers: an in vitro evaluation.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers after 2, 20 and 40 days. The sealers studied were Apexit, Endion, AH26, AH-Plus. Procosol and Ketac Endo. The microorganisms used were Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces israelii. Petri dishes were filled with sterile agar and 0.1-ml wells were prepared and filled with the sealers. The agar plates were stored for 24 h at 37 degrees C. The samples were then removed, immersed in 4.5 ml of culture medium and divided into three groups. The samples in group 1 were stored for 2 days at 37 degrees C whereas the samples of groups 2 and 3 were stored at 4 degrees C for 20 and 40 days respectively. The samples were then removed and discarded, and 0.1 ml of the culture medium was seeded on the agar plates in order to perform colony forming unit counts. Apexit, Endion and AH-Plus produced slight inhibition on Streptococcus mutans at 20 days and on Actinomyces israelii at every time interval. No effect was found on Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. Ketac Endo only produced an antimicrobial effect on Actinomyces israelii at 2 and 40 days. AH26 and Procosol showed antimicrobial effect at 40 days on Candida albicans, at 20 and 40 days on Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus, and an effective inhibition on Actinomyces israelii at every time interval. Statistical analysis revealed both sealers and microorganisms to be significant factors affecting results in groups 2 and 3. In conclusion, the sealers evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects depending on time span. Overall, sealers containing cugenol and formaldehyde proved to be most effective against the microorganisms at the time intervals studied.
TI  - Bacteria associated with clinical mastitis in dairy heifers.
AB  - A 1-yr field investigation of clinical mastitis in heifers was carried out in 24  veterinary districts in Norway. Quarter lacteal secretions from cases that occurred prepartum or within 14 d postpartum were examined bacteriologically. The study included 1040 heifers with clinical mastitis, and the total number of quarters that were clinically affected was 1361. The organisms that were most frequently isolated from samples from these quarters were Staphylococcus aureus (44.3%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (18.2%), Staph. aureus together with Strep. dysgalactiae (1.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.8%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3.5%), A. pyogenes together with Strep. dysgalactiae (0.5%) or Staph. aureus (0.4%), and Escherichia coli (6.4%). Of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus simulans (53.7%), Staphylococcus hyicus (14.8%), and Staphylococcus chromogenes (14.8%) were the most prevalent species. Except for a higher relative percentage of A. pyogenes in cases that occurred before parturition (8.2%) than in cases that occurred after parturition (2.7%), no significant differences were observed in the distribution of the various organisms among prepartum and postpartum cases. Regional variations were observed in the distribution of organisms. The proportions of Staph. aureus and A. pyogenes were highest, and the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci was lowest, in late autumn and early winter. The proportion of E. coli was highest in summer. In heifers in which mastitis was associated with increased rectal temperature or other systemic signs, the proportion of clinically affected quarters that were infected with Staph. aureus was larger than that in heifers without systemic reaction.
TI  - The microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  - This study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (NR-group; 11 participants) or responsive (R-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. Microbiological samples from three types of pocket (< 4 mm deep A-samples; 4-5 mm B-samples; > 5 mm C-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. Actinomyces naeslundii, A. israelii, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. The periodontitis pathogens Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the A- and B-samples of both patient groups and in the C-samples of the R-group. In the C-samples of the NR-group their mean counts were 45%. Correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the C-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. The results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. Further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Isolation of Fusobacterium necrophorum from cancrum oris (noma).
AB  - A study of the predominant microflora in active sites of noma (cancrum oris) lesions was carried out in eight noma patients 3-15 years of age in Sokoto State in northwestern Nigeria. Paper point sampling and conventional anaerobic microbiologic techniques were used. Fusobacterium necrophorum was recovered from 87.5% of the noma lesions. Oral microorganisms included Prevotella intermedia, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Actinomyces spp. which were isolated from 75.0%, 50.0%, and 37.5% of the patients, respectively. Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas spp. were each recovered from one lesion. The F. necrophorum and P. intermedia isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity to clindamycin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and penicillin using the E-test, and all strains were observed to be sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested with the exception of one strain of P. intermedia, which showed resistance to penicillin. The first reported isolation from human noma lesions of F. necrophorum, a pathogen primarily associated with animal diseases, may have important etiologic and animal transmission implications.
TI  - Incidence risk and aetiology of mammary abnormalities in dry ewes in 10 flocks in southern Greece.
AB  - In a field investigation of 10 flocks in Southern Greece, 3367 dairy ewes were examined twice, in order to estimate the incidence risk and the aetiology of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period. Abnormal secretion, lumps, nodules, diffuse hardness, abscesses and cysts were the abnormalities detected. The cumulative incidence of mammary abnormalities during the dry-period was 5.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.4-5.8%); 47% of the cases detected developed during the first three weeks after cessation of lactation. Despite variation in the flock size, there was no between-flock variation in the risk of a ewe developing mammary abnormalities. Staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative isolates) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from mammary samples; Actinomyces pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, streptococci and Escherichia coli were also isolated. Resistance was encountered among the staphylococcal isolates.
TI  - Oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  - Candida albicans (Ca), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Streptococcus sanguis (Ss), Actinomyces naeslundii (An), Actinomyces odontolyticus (Ao), Porphyromona spp (P spp), Candida glabrata (Cg), Candida krusei (Ck), and Rhodotorula spp (R spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. Membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 mL homologous suspension for each strain under study. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. Macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. Membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. Samples were sonicated, and the supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. Incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to Log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. Orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. Highest adhesion was found with Ca, Cg, Ck, Sa, and Ss. A sufficient quantity of Actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. Results with P spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. Replicate flasks with Ss and Ca were cultivated. Membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control pieces. A cavelike surface was observed. Streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. Candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.
TI  - The efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  - There is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "Oral Health for a Healthy Life" proposed for the 1994 World Health Day. In this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly Listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. Listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Helicobacter pylori, Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. Bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to Listerine. When saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of Listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced to 1%. When Listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. This was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of Listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. The use of antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. In Japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. For the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. Indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.
TI  - Experimental induction of renal lesions in chickens.
AB  - The present work was conducted to investigate the possibility of inducing renal lesions in chickens subcutaneously or orally inoculated with E. coli [E. coli O1K67(B12)], Staphylococcus aureus and Actinomyces pyogenes. The strains were previously isolated from the kidneys of broilers showing different pathological lesions. The gross lesions observed in the kidneys included enlargement, congestion, haemorrhagic spots in addition to dilatation and distension of the ureters. The microscopic lesions were mainly interstitial nephritis. The lesions were acute and changed gradually to subacute or chronic nephritis. The glomerular lesions were not common. The wall of the primary branches of the ureter and the ureters was heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells, also granular and albuminous casts were seen in the renal tubules. The lesions were not related to the inoculated pathogen, although they were more severe in chickens inoculated with E. coli and Staph. aureus more than in Actinomyces pyogenes. Reisolation of the inoculated pathogens was more successful from the birds inoculated subcutaneously than from those infected orally.
TI  - Primary pulmonary botryomycosis: case report and review.
AB  - Botryomycosis is an uncommon bacterial disease characterized by the microscopic formation of eosinophilic granules that resemble those of infection by Actinomyces species. The diagnosis of botryomycosis can be made when microscopic inspection and culture of the granules reveal gram-positive cocci or gram-negative bacilli. Botryomycosis is caused by common bacterial pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, yet the host and microbial factors that contribute to the pathobiology remain unknown. Pulmonary botryomycosis can resemble actinomycosis, tuberculosis, or invasive carcinoma by causing a mass lesion with constitutional symptoms. Radiographically, it invades bone and disrupts tissue planes. Successful treatment often requires a combination of both surgical debridement and long-term antimicrobial therapy. We report a case of primary pulmonary botryomycosis and review the literature on this unusual infectious process.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII.
AB  - An antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive Streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain PonSSII has been isolated and partially characterized. The antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. The activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. Purification techniques included chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, DEAE Sephadex and SP Sephadex in addition to C18 HPLC with an average yield of 75%. This antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of S. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect S. griseus, S. venezuelae, Actinomyces bovis, Nocardia asteroides, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic pH but is very labile at alkaline pH conditions.
TI  - Enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Model biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. Plaque-resembling biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. Glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. A complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have a significant bactericidal activity. Combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.
TI  - Bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (H) versus unhealthy (UH) animals with respiratory signs. The prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract of H and UH Najdi sheep, Somali sheep and Holstein calves. The characteristics of Pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of Pasteurella haemolytica were identified in H and UH animals, Eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of UH Najdi and Somali sheep and Holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of UH sheep were Moraxella spp., Pseudomonas pseudomallei, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in UH calves were Pasteurella haemolytica, Actinomyces spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of UH animals, namely Actinomyces pyogenes, Erysipelothrix spp., P. haemolytica, Pasteurella ureae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of the animals surveyed. Of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified P. haemolytica and P. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from UH as compared to those from H animals. These were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of P. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of P. multocida recovered from healthy animals. The only biotype of P. haemolytica isolated from H animals was biotype A, while both biotypes A (88.0% of the isolates) and T (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from UH animals.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Summer mastitis experimentally induced by Hydrotaea irritans exposed to bacteria.
AB  - Summer mastitis is an acute suppurative bacterial infection of the udder in heifers and dry cows. To ascertain the possible role of flies in the transmission of the disease, experimental exposures of recipient heifers to Hydrotaea irritans previously exposed to bacteria were carried out. Flies were allowed to feed on secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis. The pathogens present were the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan cocci, Peptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacterioides species. The teats of eight heifers were exposed to flies with verified pathogen content. Two teats of each animal were deliberately damaged before fly exposure. One teat was cut, another pricked with insect needles to mimic insect bites. Two of the heifers developed summer mastitis in the quarters where teats had been cut. The bacterial species isolated from these quarters corresponded to those that had previously been fed to the flies. For the first time, it is now demonstrated that H.irritans is capable of transmitting summer mastitis pathogens and so causing summer mastitis in recipient heifers. Lesions on the teat orifice may be a predisposing factor in the development of the disease.
TI  - Survival of selected bacteria and fungi in hypertonic (7.2%) saline.
AB  
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). The isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from the species Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus group C, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative rods from the genus Haemophilus and rods from the Enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of Moraxella catarrhalis. The isolated anaerobic microorganisms Gram-negative rods from the genus Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Gram-positive cocci from the genus Peptostreptococcus. Other organisms from the genus Vailonella, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were isolated less frequently. In 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.
TI  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. A total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. Though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the 495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). In 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), Pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). Staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and Streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). Among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as S. suis, the major serotype was S. suis type 2 (35.4%). The remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). A total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.
TI  - Community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in Harare, Zimbabwe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV infection is common in mothers and their children in Zimbabwe, and HIV-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. There is little information on the etiology and outcome of HIV-related bacteremia in African children. METHODS: Blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in Zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having HIV, were examined for pathogens. The association among significant bacteremia, HIV infection and mortality was assessed in these children. RESULTS: The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), Staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). Nontyphoidal Salmonella (10 children), Escherichia coli (4 children) and Klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent Gram-negative bacteria. Two children had Rhodococcus equi pneumonia. HIV-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (OR) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (OR = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (OR = 15.76). There was no significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. Mortality was 17% overall but was higher in HIV-infected children up to 6 months of age (OR = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (OR = 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: Prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in HIV-infected children in Africa.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  - Infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA,  and Candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. We enumerated MRSA and C. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. Staphylococcus species, MRSA, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSE, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. C. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. All saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried Staphylococcus species and C. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. Adherence of isolated 3H labeled cells of MRSA and C. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. Cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. The hydrophobicity of the MRSA isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of C. albicans strains was moderately high. The zeta potentials of MRSA isolates and of C. albicans isolates determined in KCI buffer were significantly low. The potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. Two out of 5 MRSA strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of Staphylococcus species. No isolates of C. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the oral bacteria tested. Isolates of MRSA and C. albicans coaggregated with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum strains. Using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of Staphylococcus species or C. albicans organisms in saliva.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Blood selenium, vitamin E, vitamin A, and beta-carotene concentrations and udder  health, fertility treatments, and fertility.
AB  - We investigated the activity of glutathione peroxidase in whole blood; concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin A, and beta-carotene in serum; SCC; udder bacterial infections and the incidence of clinical mastitis; fertility treatments; and the success of first AI of 511 dairy cows for 1 yr. The mean Se content in whole blood and the concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin A, and beta-carotene concentrations in serum were 191 micrograms/L, 5.9 mg/L, 0.39 mg/L, and 12.9 mg/L, respectively. An increase in Se concentration in whole blood was associated with a decrease in all infections, including infections by Staphylococcus aureus, Actinomyces pyogenes, and Corynebacterium spp. (-17.7, -31.7, and -70.6%, respectively). There was no association among the different infections or SCC and concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta-carotene, but an association existed between vitamin A concentration and SCC. The lower Se concentration in whole blood did not increase incidence of clinical mastitis. The Se concentration in whole blood (200 micrograms/L) was accepted as a target value to optimize udder health. The incidence of fertility disorders (anestrus, subestrus, cystic ovaries, or delayed ovulation) was 34.4%. The pregnancy rate following first insemination was 48.6%. No significant association was observed among Se in whole blood; concentrations of total vitamin E, vitamin A, or beta-carotene in serum; and fertility disorders or success of first AI.
TI  - Importance of Staphylococcus hyicus ssp hyicus as a cause of arthritis in pigs up to 12 weeks of age.
AB  - Lame pigs, up to 12 weeks of age, were necropsied to establish a diagnosis. Of 175 pigs examined, 165 were confirmed to have arthritis by histopathological examination of joint tissues. Lesions were most common in the elbow and tarsal joints and least common in the joints of the feet. Typically, there was severe fibrinopurulent inflammation of synovial membranes regardless of the bacteria isolated. A bacterial aetiology was found in 114 (69%) of the 165 pigs. In arthritic pigs in which an aetiology was established the causative agents were Staphylococcus hyicus ssp hyicus (24.6%), Streptococcus equisimilis (26.3%), Actinomyces pyogenes (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and Haemophilus parasuis (7.9%). While gender did not affect the prevalence of arthritis, there was an age influence, most of the pigs culled for arthritis being under 6 weeks of age.
TI  - Whole mouth microbiota effects following subgingival delivery of sanguinarium.
AB  - An increased incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeast overgrowth has  been reported following various periodontal treatments. The objective of this study was to detect possible overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria and fungi as well as changes in normal microbiota after application of a biodegradable delivery system containing 5% sanguinarium (ABDS-S) to one quadrant in a split-mouth study. An oral hygiene quadrant served as a control. The ABDS-S treated and control periodontal sites as well as the saliva of 17 subjects were sampled prior to treatment, immediately after ABDS-S removal at 7 days, and again at 30 and 60 days. At Day 7 sanguinarium-resistant bacteria increased in both control and ABDS-S periodontal sites as well as in the saliva. Enteric Gram-negative bacilli in both control and ABDS-S periodontal sites were 2.2 to 3.4 log colony forming units higher at Day 7 compared to baseline. This overgrowth was transient in that levels became undetectable at Days 30 and 60. No such overgrowth was observed for C. albicans or other fungi, or for S. aureus or other staphylococci in any periodontal sites. Levels of Actinomyces increased at Days 30 and 60 in both control and ABDS-S sites as well as saliva. These changes strongly suggest that a 7 day ABDS-S treatment in one quadrant of the mouth led to significant microbiota changes in the treated and control quadrants as well as in the saliva. Future microbial studies involving antimicrobials delivered by local delivery systems must consider the crossover effects of treatment inherent in the split-mouth design.
TI  - Subclinical mastitis and milk production in primiparous Simmental cows.
AB  - The prevalence of subclinical mastitis in beef cows was investigated and its relationship with milk production and 205-d adjusted calf weaning weights (ADJWW) determined. Primiparous Simmental cows (n = 25) were milked six times at approximately 30-d intervals. Before each milking, milk samples were aseptically collected from each quarter for bacteriological analyses. After recording milk weights, samples were obtained for determination of somatic cell counts (SCC), butterfat (BF), and protein (PRO). Somatic cell counts were transformed to Dairy Herd Improvement Association linear scores for statistical analyses. Cows were retrospectively assigned to one of two groups based on their SCC linear score being either less than (LOSCC) or more than (HISCC) 4.5, which corresponded to a SCC of 292 x 10(3) cells/mL. Milk samples from 32% (8/25) of the cows and 18% (18/100) of the quarters were culture-positive for bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus species, Actinomyces pyogenes, and[or] coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) at one or more times. Milk production was higher in LOSCC than in HISCC cows (6.3 +/- .2 vs 5.4 +/- .3 kg/24 h; P = .004). Mean SCC linear score tended to be negatively correlated with mean milk production over the entire study (r = -.36; P = .08). Adjusted weaning weights were similar between calves suckling LOSCC and HISCC cows (243 +/- 5 vs 236 +/- 10 kg; P = .57). In summary, milk SCC concentrations in primiparous Simmental cows were highly variable. Higher SCC concentrations were associated with lower milk production in cows.
TI  - Bacteriology of skin and soft-tissue infections: comparison of infections in intravenous drug users and individuals with no history of intravenous drug use.
AB  - The bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-IVDUs). The IVDU abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "Streptococcus milleri" (46%). The commonly encountered anaerobes were Fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented Prevotella species (22%), Peptostreptococcus micros (17%), Actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and Veillonella species (13%). The non-IVDU isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. S. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "S. milleri" (19%), and Streptococcus pyogenes (16%). The main groups of anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (35%), Bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). Overall, 67% of the IVDU isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-IVDU isolates. Of the specimens from IVDUs and non-IVDUs, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. Sixty-four percent of the patients had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.
TI  - A retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Clinical Research Laboratory (Los Angeles). Anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. Thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. A total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. The most common isolates were as follows: Fusobacterium nucleatum (19); Prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were P. oris); Bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were B. fragilis); pigmented Prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the Prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); Peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were Peptostreptococcus micros); Eubacterium species (7); Lactobacillus species (8); Actinomyces species (7); and Clostridium species (7). Nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: F. nucleatum (five cases); B. fragilis (two cases); and Prevotella mangus (one case). Of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group D nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). Only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one Staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. The susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (MICs ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/mL vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/mL for beta-lactamase-negative strains).
TI  - Clinical pharmacologic aspects of cefixime in dogs.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefixime, a new third-generation orally administered caphalosporin, was determined for reference and clinical isolates from dogs. The MIC of the drug for all but 1 of the 18 Enterobacteriaceae isolates tested, 1 Pasteurella canis, 1 Rhodococcus equi, 1 Streptococcus canis, and 1 Streptococcus group G isolate, was less than 1.0 microgram/ml. The MIC for 9 Staphylococcus intermedius isolates ranged from 1.56 to 6.25 micrograms/ml and, for 8 Sta aureus isolates, the MIC values ranged from 1.56 to 12.5 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinomyces sp, and a single Bordetella bronchiseptica isolate were considered resistant to cefixime. Cefixime was administered orally in 2 phases at a standard dosage of 5 mg/kg of body weight to clinically normal adult male and female dogs. In the first phase, the drug was given once as a capsule and once as a suspension. In the second phase, it was administered once per day for 6 consecutive days in capsule form. Serum drug concentration was determined by use of a microbiological assay, and the following kinetic values were estimated for each dog: area under the concentration-time curve, peak serum drug concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax, absorption half-life, and elimination half-life (t1/2el). The kinetic profile of the drug in serum after oral administration of a single dose of cefixime was similar, with mean Cmax values of 3.36 and 4.76 micrograms/ml after treatment with the capsule and suspension, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cervicofacial actinomycosis (a case report).
AB  - Actinomycosis is now a very uncommonly diagnosed human disease. Major medical centers report approximately one case a year. The pathogenesis of actinomycosis is unclear, but trauma provides a portal of entry. The cervicofacial form is the most common and usually appears as a chronic swelling with one or more draining sinus tracts. For treatment, penicillin in high doses is suggested. This case report presents a case of cervicofacial actinomycosis in a 14 year old boy which was misdiagnosed for a long time and the treatment of the disease with mezlocillin, a new antibiotic in the treatment of actinomycosis.
TI  - Isolation of gram-positive rods that resemble but are clearly distinct from Actinomyces pyogenes from mixed wound infections.
AB  - Beginning in 1990, gram-positive rods resembling Actinomyces pyogenes were found  with increasing frequency in mixed cultures from various infectious processes, most of them from patients with otitis, empyema, pilonidal cysts, perianal abscesses, and decubitus ulcers. Ribotyping and hybridization showed that these gram-positive rods could be divided into five groups not related to known Actinomyces species. Biochemical markers for reliable differentiation into these groups, however, could not be found. Therefore, naming new species is not warranted unless parameters are discovered that allow identification without DNA hybridization. These gram-positive rods have been isolated only in mixed cultures with anaerobes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus "milleri," enterococci, and gram-negative rods. Their exact role in these possibly synergistic infections needs further investigation.
TI  - Immunohistochemical distribution of S-100 alpha-positive cells in bovine mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial granulomas.
AB  - By means of immunohistochemistry, the distribution of the alpha-subunit (S-100 alpha) and the beta-subunit (S-100 beta) of S-100 protein was studied in bovine granulomas caused by Actinomyces bovis, Actinobacillus lignieresi, Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. S-100 alpha-positive epithelioid cells or dendritic cells were scattered among the predominantly S-100 alpha-negative cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). S-100 beta was not found in the MPS cells of granulomas but was observed in the endothelial cells of blood vessels. A positive reaction to S-100 was also seen in normal cells in the lymphoid and mammary tissues. Mycobacterial granulomas contained more S-100 alpha-positive cells than did non-mycobacterial ones.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Isolation and amino acid sequence of a glutamic acid specific endopeptidase from  Bacillus licheniformis.
AB  - An endopeptidase cleaving specifically at the carboxyl side of acidic amino acid  residues, preferentially at glutamic acid, has been isolated from a commercial extract obtained by fermentation with Bacillus licheniformis. Using ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on bacitracin-Sepharose, it was possible, from 100 ml commercial extract, to isolate 100 mg homogeneous enzyme in a yield of 50%. It is the first description of a large-scale isolation of a Glu/Asp-specific enzyme. The preparation was essentially free of contaminating activities. The isolated enzyme consists of one peptide chain of 222 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 23,589 Da. The determined amino acid sequence shows similarity to the Glu/Asp-specific enzymes previously isolated from Staphylococcus aureus V8, Actinomyces sp. and Streptomyces thermovulgaris. The substrate preference of the enzyme has been investigated. Although non-specific cleavages were observed after prolonged hydrolysis at high enzyme concentrations the enzyme appears to be essentially specific for Glu-Xaa and Asp-Xaa, with strong preference for the former. The isolated enzyme exhibits a bell-shaped pH/activity profile with an optimum at pH 7.5-8.0. The activity is adversely affected by high ionic strength and beneficially affected by the inclusion of calcium ions in the assay medium. The enzyme is completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, suggesting that it is a serine endopeptidase. It is partially inhibited by EDTA.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, etiologic agent, and duration of clinical signs  for sequential episodes of chronic clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - This study examined effects of repeated episodes of clinical mastitis in chronically infected quarters on milk N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity and duration of clinical signs. Milk samples were collected at each clinical onset from 49 chronic mastitis cases on a 1700-cow Michigan dairy farm. There were 49 first episodes of clinical mastitis, 49 second episodes, and 13 episodes of third or more. Agents isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (18.4%), Staphylococcus (7.3%), no growth (20.2%), environmental pathogens (streptococci other than agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp.) (22.0%), other pathogens (Serratia spp., Bacillus spp., diphtheroids [Corynebacterium spp. and Actinomyces pyogenes], Pseudomonas spp., and Nocardia spp.) (11.9%), mixed pathogens (two agents isolated) (12.8%), and contaminated samples (7.3%). Etiologic agents, duration of clinical signs, and NAGase did not differ by episode number. The correlation between log of NAGase and log of time until clinical recovery was .34. The relationship between NAGase and duration of clinical signs was strongest for second episodes, and weakest for third and greater episodes of chronic mastitis.
TI  - Bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in Sweden.
AB  - Bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in Sweden. Streptococci, e.g. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. Bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. Actinomyces pyogenes, Stuart-Schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus indolicus, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). When the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, May 15 to October 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). These figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. Whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of A. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. There were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas Str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. This and other Swedish investigations support the theory that A. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on Str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. It is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.
TI  - A sensitive method for isolating Fusobacterium necrophorum from faeces.
AB  - The isolation of Fusobacterium necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces or soil is hampered by the lack of an efficient selective medium and by the high minimum infective dose of the organism. A sensitive method for the detection and isolation of faecal strains of F. necrophorum type A was based on the subcutaneous injection of faeces, suspended (5% w/v) in broth culture of Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus to increase fusobacterial infectivity, into mice pretreated with clostridial antitoxins. When necrobacillosis developed F. necrophorum was identified microscopically in tissue from the advancing edge of the lesion and isolated on a partly selective medium. The enhancement of fusobacterial infectivity produced by A. pyogenes and by S. aureus was high, but the latter was slightly the more efficient, enabling as few as 80 F. necrophorum organisms/g of faeces to be detected. Use of the method showed that 3 of 16 wallabies had F. necrophorum in their faeces at the time of examination. Numerous epidemiological applications are suggested.
TI  - Further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - It had already been shown with a single virulent strain (A42) of Fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. The present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include Bacillus subtilis, 'Bacteroides melaninogenicus', Clostridium sporogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Proteus mirabilis. The study also showed that five further virulent strains of F. necrophorum closely resembled A42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by Escherichia coli. Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes and S. aureus. One further strain (A6) of F. necrophorum resembled A42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by A. pyogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus and K. oxytoca but differed from it and the other five strains in being only slightly affected by E. coli. This work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of F. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.
TI  - Epizootic of external and internal abscesses in a large goat herd over a 16-year  period.
AB  - From 1973 through 1988, 518 external and internal abscesses were diagnosed in a large commercial goat herd. Of the 518 abscesses, 238 were primary and 280 were secondary abscesses in the same or other anatomic locations. During this period, the herd varied in size from 94 goats in 1973 to 431 goats in 1988. Abscesses in the jaw area were detected in 141 goats, 4 of which developed osteomyelitis of the mandible. Sternal abscesses were detected in 72 goats, with 2 also having osteomyelitis of the sternum diagnosed at necropsy. Most of the abscesses were in the jaw, sternal, facial, and cervical areas. Lung abscesses were diagnosed at necropsy in 20 goats that most recently had 1 or more superficial abscesses. Abscess incidence was 27.6% (112 of 406) in wethers and 22.9% (154 of 687) in does. Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated most frequently by bacteriologic culture of abscess specimens and about 3 times as often as was Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis or Staphylococcus sp, usually coagulase-positive S aureus. Bacteriologic culture of blood samples, taken during abscess episodes, yielded A pyogenes (n = 3) or C pseudotuberculosis (n = 1) in 3 goats. Results of antibiotic treatment of abscesses were disappointing, with little evidence of altering the course of the disease or sterilizing the abscess, despite the fact that the bacteria were susceptible in vitro to the antibiotics used. Excision of intact abscesses was the preferred treatment for abscesses of the jaw and facial areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies of antigens related to metabolic and growth inhibitions of Staphylococcus aureus L-form].
AB  - Metabolic and growth inhibiting activities in immunoglobulin (of anti-S. aureus L-form serum and anti-S. aureus coccal form serum) could be absorbed by cell membranes of S. aureus L-form and its coccal form, respectively. These activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes or Actinomyces viscosus. These findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. The membrane antigens of L-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. A large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of L-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). A fractionation study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal exposures for selected oral bacteria using carbon dioxide laser radiation.
AB  - Although relatively high CO2 laser energies have been shown to sterilize root canals, the response of several bacterial strains to decreasing exposures of CO2 laser energy remains unknown. Freshly grown bacterial cells were irradiated on glass microscope coverslips. A comparison of equivalent energy exposures with differing parameters was made on the bacterial viability. No statistically significant difference was found in the energy required to kill closely related bacterial species. However, the energy density required to kill greater than 99.5% of the bacteria is less than 200 J/cm2, much less than that shown to sterilize in a previous study.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - Properties of a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) extracted from intact cells of Streptococcus sanguis.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus sanguis strain Challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. A polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kDa comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (HPr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. In vivo labelling of S. sanguis cells with 32Pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the HPr became dephosphorylated. Antiserum raised to the S. sanguis HPr reacted on Western blots with HPrs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of S. pyogenes and S. salivarius, but not with HPrs from S. faecalis or S. bovis, nor with proteins from Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Actinomyces viscosus and various lactobacilli. The S. sanguis HPr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the HPrs from S. mutans an S. salivarius. The N-terminal residues (to 37) of the S. sanguis HPr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the N-terminal sequence of S. faecalis HPr. It is suggested that HPr in S. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. Non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of HPr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Effect of freezing on bacteriologic culturing of mastitis milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the effect of freezing and length of freezing in a commercial freezer on the qualitative results of bacteriologic culturing of milk collected from glands of cows with clinical or subclinical intramammary infections. A total of 182 milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 55 milk samples of cows with subclinical mastitis were taken from four problem herds. Samples were split into four equal sub-samples. Three of these were frozen immediately at -20 degrees C and 1 was submitted fresh for bacteriologic analysis. At 4, 8, and 16 wk after collection, samples were thawed and submitted for bacteriologic culturing. Freezing and increased length of storage resulted in 1) a decrease in the number of samples that had cultures of Escherichia coli or Actinomyces pyogenes; and 2) an increase in the number of samples that had cultures of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Freezing had no effect on streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in samples of milk from cows studied for the causative  agent of mastitis].
AB  - Milk samples (483,413 on the whole), collected from 237,026 cows, were investigated in the State Veterinary Institute at Pardubice in the period from 1983 to 1987. In the individual years, the proportion of cows whose milk contained the mastitis-inducing bacteria ranged from 18.0 to 24.8%, the average being 21.0%. Streptococcus agalactiae was identified most frequently as the causative agent of mastitis in the examined cows (6.4%); then followed Streptococcus dysgalactiae (3.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.4%), and Streptococcus uberis (1.9%). The presence of the beta-haemolytic streptococci with group antigens C, G and L was demonstrated in the milk of 720 cows (i. e. 0.3%) and the remaining species of streptococci were identified in 1.0% of the cows. Coliform microorganisms were detected in 0.6% and Actinomyces pyogenes in 0.1% of the cows. The remaining bacterial species were isolated from the milk of 3.6% of the cows. Coaglucase-negative staphylococci dominated in this group. Over the five years of study, the occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae in the examined stocks declined from 10.8 to 3.5% but the occurrence of other streptococci and staphylococci increased.
TI  - Immunohistochemical localization of immunoglobulins in bovine granulomatous lesions.
AB  - The immunohistochemical distribution of IgG, IgA and IgM in granulomatous lesions caused by Actinomyces bovis, Actinobacillus lignieresi, Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium bovis was studied. Numerous IgG-containing cells (plasma cells) were distributed in the peripheral connective tissue layers, but not in the epithelioid cell layer. A few scattered IgA- and IgM-containing cells were found in all the lesions examined. Mycobacterial granulomas contained fewer IgG-cells than did non-mycobacterial granulomas. Eosinophilic club-shaped bodies were found in A. bovis, A. lignieresi, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, but they were generally negative for IgG, IgA and IgM.
TI  - [Enzymatic lysis of staphylococcal cells and isolation of cell walls].
AB  - Procedures for lyzing staphylococcal cells with the use of ultrasound, lysozyme and a lytic enzyme complex of Actinomyces recifensis var. lyticus, 2435 were compared. The lysis level was estimated by two parameters: lower optical density and protein yield percentage. It was found that ultrasound provided rather high levels of cell destruction reaching 60-68 per cent. The use of lysozyme enabled to destroy 16 per cent of the cells. The enzyme complex of strain 2435 showed high lytic activity with respect to the tested culture. For destroying dense staphylococcal suspensions it appeared necessary to study the effect of preliminary treatment of the cells with various chemical substances on their liability to the effect of the enzyme complex. It was demonstrated that treatment of the cells with 0.01-0.1 M cystein HCl solutions, 0.01-0.02 M sodium dodecylsulfate solutions or 0.05-0.5 M sodium hydroxide solutions increased 2.6-4.7-fold the cell liability to enzymatic hydrolysis. The studies enabled to develop conditions providing complete lysis of 10-percent staphylococcal cell suspension within 5 to 15 minutes under the effect of the lytic enzyme complex of strain 2435. A procedure for isolating cell walls was developed.
TI  - [Effect of lytic enzymes on Staphylococcus and the possibilities of their combined use with antibiotics].
AB  - Dependence of lytic enzyme preparation activity on temperature and time of Staphylococcus incubation with the preparation was shown. A decrease in the activity with an increase in the ionic strength of the incubation solutions and protective effect of salts on the staphylococcal cells were observed. Possible combined use of the preparation with antibiotics was studied. The enzymatic preparation inactivated penicillins and cephalosporins at the account of the ability of lytic endopeptidases to hydrolyze the peptide bond of the beta-lactam ring. However, its combined use with many other antibiotics such as novobiocin, lincomycin, rifampicin, gramicidin, polymyxin, oleandomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline and levomycetin is quite possible.
TI  - Inhibitory and cidal antimicrobial actions of electrically generated silver ions.
AB  - One promising alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of localized infections is the generation of antimicrobial silver ions by the use of low intensity direct current from a pure silver anode implanted at the site of an infection. This study investigates the in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of this system on a variety of organisms.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Coagglutination reactions between Candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  - An agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of Candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. Strains of Streptococcus sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, S. mitis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with C. albicans. No interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of C. albicans. Preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of F. nucleatum and A. viscosus to C. albicans is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. Other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to C. albicans. The possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - Immunoregulation in severe generalized periodontitis.
AB  - Severe generalized periodontitis (SGP) is an inflammatory disease which leads to  extensive alveolar bone loss in young adults. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from SGP patients have been previously reported to exhibit an in vitro hyperproliferative response when exposed to B cell mitogens derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Actinomyces viscosus. Therefore hyperresponsiveness to B-cell mitogens could be an important pathogenic factor in the susceptibility to and progression of SGP. We have tested whether the hyperproliferative response of lymphocytes from SGP patients was due to (i) a functional deficiency of suppressor T cells, or (ii) to numerical alterations of lymphocytes. Supernatant fluids from concanavalin A-stimulated T cells from 14 SGP patients and 14 normal subjects were compared for their ability to suppress the IgM synthesis of B-cell mitogen-stimulated mouse splenocytes. No significant differences were noted in suppressor T-cell function between control subjects and SGP patients. However, SGP patients had significantly higher lymphocyte counts than control subjects, and there was a positive correlation between high lymphocyte counts and high mitogen-stimulated proliferation. SGP patients also had higher lymphocyte:monocyte ratios than control subjects, suggesting that a defect in macrophage-mediated suppression might be involved in the hyperproliferation phenomenon. Our data do not support the hypothesis that a suppressor T-cell defect is the cause of mitogen-induced hyperproliferative responsiveness of peripheral blood lymphocytes from SGP patients. Rather, hyperproliferation may be due to an expansion of the lymphocyte pool which responds to mitogens, or/and a regulatory disturbance which arises because of altered lymphocyte:macrophage ratios.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activity in oral microorganisms.
AB  - Samples were taken from blood accumulated in dental alveoli after surgical removal of mandibular third molars, from subgingival plaque of teeth with advanced periodontal destructions, from teeth with infected necrotic pulps, and from subjects suffering from angular cheilitis. Of the microorganisms subcultured from these samples, 116 strains were assayed for enzymes degrading fibrinogen and fibrin. Enzymes degrading fibrinogen were assayed with the thin-layer enzyme assay cultivation technique. This assay involves the cultivation of microorganisms on culture agars applied over fibrinogen-coated polystyrene surfaces. Enzymes degrading fibrin were assayed with both a plate assay and a tube assay, in which fibrin was mixed with a microbial culture medium. Microorganisms degrading fibrinogen or fibrin or both were isolated from all sampling sites. Activity was mainly detected in strains of Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Propionibacterium, and Staphylococcus aureus. Most Fusobacterium strains degraded fibrinogen only. Enzymes degrading fibrinogen as well as enzymes degrading fibrin via activation of plasminogen were revealed in strains of Clostridium, S. aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. It was generally found that fibrinogen was degraded by more strains than was fibrin, which indicates that different proteases may be involved.
TI  - Isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans Rm-10.
AB  - An extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of Streptococcus mutans Rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. There was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. Vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees C for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. It was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase C. The inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions of the bactericidal material. The results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. Activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. It was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Activation of the alternate complement pathway by peptidoglycan of Actinomyces viscosus, a potentially pathogenic oral bacterium.
AB  - Peptidoglycans and cells walls from Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus,  and group A streptococcus were compared for their relative abilities to activate the alternate complement pathway (ACP). On the dry-weight basis, the peptidoglycan from A. viscosus was 3.5 times more active than group A streptococcal peptidoglycan and 15.6 times more active than Staph. aureus peptidoglycan in activating the ACP. Consequently A. viscosus peptidoglycan is one of the most potent ACP-activators reported to date. For both A. viscosus and group A streptococcus, the peptidoglycan was a better ACP activator than cell walls from the same organism (125- and 52-fold, respectively) indicating that the peptidoglycan is probably the most important subcellular ACP-activator in these microorganisms. In contrast, cell walls from Staph, aureus were 9 times more active than peptidoglycan from Staph. aureus in activating the ACP, presumably because teichoic acids are the most important subcellular ACP activator in this microorganism.
TI  - [Isolation and evaluation of properties of muramidase causing the lysis of group  A streptococci].
AB  - Muramidase which actively lyses the cell walls of group A hemolytic streptococci  has been isolated from the culture fluid of Actinomyces levoris by precipitation on ammonium sulfate, gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose and double electrofocusing. The enzyme thus obtained has shown its maximum activity at 40-50 degrees C. At 60 degrees C muramidase was completely inactivated. The enzyme has a wide range of optimum pH values: 5.0-9.5. The highest percentage of lysis of streptococcal cell walls has been observed in plycine-NaOH and potassium phosphate buffers at pH 8.0. Muramidase completely lysed Streptococcus pyogenes cells of different serological groups except enterococci (group D) and staphylococci. This sign allows to differentiate group D streptococcus from streptococci of other groups.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  - BACTERIAL-NEUTROPHIL INTERACTIONS may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. Included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of Capnocytophaga, Bacteroides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria, Actinomyces viscosus, Bacterionema matruchotii, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. Chemotaxis was measured using Boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using Staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. None of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. Capnocytophaga species., Bacteroides species., A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. Activity was lost after dialysis. Extracts of Bacteroides species, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. The exception was Capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. Such chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.
TI  - Recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  - L-phase (CWD) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. Two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) Type B CWD variants in equally low numbers. Organisms in group 1 were: Streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci, Lancefield Gp. G (2x); Staphylococcus aureus; Actinobacillus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Group 2 consisted of Bacteroides sp., Propionibacterium acnes, and three "Nocardia-like" sp. Catalase + Actinomyces was not recovered equally well on CWD plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. This occurred in spite of the fact that the CWD media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced L-phase variants of Nocardia caviae and N. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a Bacteroides L-phase variant from a pleural fluid. The nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  - We examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (S. mutans, S. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (S. mitis, A. viscosus, S. aureus, E. coli). We observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. Heat treatment (80 degrees C, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. Supplementation of saliva with H(2)O(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. S. mitis and A. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by H(2)O(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by S. mutans and S. mitis required ca. 10 muM H(2)O(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. Loss of the inhibitory action of saliva occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. Supplementation of saliva dilutions with SCN(-) and H(2)O(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca. 0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. We suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. Furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and SCN(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. The resistance of A. viscosus, S. aureus, and E. coli to the inhibitory potential of saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. The resistance of S. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on H(2)O(2) accumulation by this organism compared with S. mutans and S. sanguis. The basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. The role of the salivary lactoperoxidase-SCN(-)-H(2)O(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.
TI  - Human serum precipitins to human dental plaque and oral bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Bacteriolytic activity of human gingival exudate.
AB  - We investigated the bacteriolytic activity of gingival crevicular fluid (CF) on 14C-labeled Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and on whole dental plaque. CF was collected from 100 healthy donors pooled and centrifuged at 200 g. CF supernate and a frozen and thawed extract of the pellet were interacted with the different bacterial strains, while Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus released 60% and 75% of the radioactive label, only 38% of it was solubilized from Streptococcus mutans, following their incubation with the CF supernate. The findings agreed with results obtained by interacting bacteria with a frozen and thawed lysate of human peripheral blood leukocytes. On the other hand, extracts from frozen and thawed CF pellet were inactive. Further, lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide were released by CF from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The role of bacteriolytic factors, present in CF, as a result of the interaction between microorganisms and leukocytes at inflammatory sites is discussed.
TI  - Heterotrophic nitrification by intestinal microorganisms.
AB  - From studies of nitrate balance in man and analyses of fecal and ileostomy samples, the possibility that nitrite and nitrate are formed de novo in the intestine, possibly by heterotrophic nitrification has emerged. This proposition significantly alters our previous conceptions of man's exposure to nitrite and suggests that nitrite may play a role in the cause of intestinal cancer. Heterotrophic nitrification has been demonstrated in various microorganisms. Our work has shown that intestinal heterotrophic microbial isolates from man are able to oxidize nitrogenous compounds to nitrite. These isolates include both procaryotes and eucaryotes.
TI  - Skin and soft tissue polymicrobial infections from intravenous abuse of drugs.
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections were studied in 21 seriously ill narcotic addicts who had been admitted to hospital. Subcutaneous abscesses were present in 14 patients; cellulitis was noted in 3, pyomyositis in 2 and necrotizing fasciitis in 2. In four patients there was septicemia. Infections in 14 patients (66.6 percent) were associated with anaerobic bacteria, which were the exclusive isolates in 6 patients. In seven patients (33.3 percent) isolates were exclusively aerobic bacteria and in eight both aerobes and anaerobes were present. The anaerobic isolates were clostridia (six), peptostreptococci (five), bacteroides (five), peptococci (three), and one of each of Veillonella, Propionibacterium, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium and Actinomyces. Staphylococcus aureus, generally thought to be the most common cause of subcutaneous infections in addicts, was found only in four (19 percent) patients. The other aerobic isolates were Klebsiella (five) and Enterobacter (four) species. When clinical features or the Gram stain of pus suggest that anaerobic bacteria may be present, antibiotic therapy should be directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria until culture results are available.

TI  - [Pigment and antibiotic substance contained in the spores of Actinomyces streptomycini B-6].
AB  - The antibiotic activity and fractional composition of the supernatant of the homogenate of Actinomyces streptomycini B-6 spores were investigated. The homogenate supernatant was of yellow colour and showed antibiotic activity when used as the test-organism of the culture St. aureus 209. The antibiotic activity was associated not with the homogenate pigment but with the colourless substance referring to streptomycins which was contained in spores.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.

TI  - Toxic properties of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The biological activity of Odontomyces viscosus, which has been reported to cause periodontal disease in hamsters, was examined. The microorganism was cultured anaerobically in Brain Heart Infusion broth, and the cells were harvested. The washed cells were injected intradermally into the abdomen of rabbits. After 72 hr, a well-defined, firm, raised nodule (about 1.0 by 1.5 cm) with an erythematous border was seen at the injection site. Suspensions of cell wall and cytoplasmic material were injected intradermally, and the lesions appeared only at the site of cell wall injection. The cell walls, which were then treated with trypsin, pepsin, and ribonuclease, again produced the characteristic lesion. These nodular dermal lesions persisted for a minimal time of 10 days. The enzymatically treated cell walls were then hydrolyzed with 1 n HCl, and such hydrolysis up to 1 hr failed to alter the toxic activity of the cell walls. Similar dermal nodular lesions were obtained by injection of enzymatically treated cell walls of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus groups B, C, E, F, K, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces israelii. Treatment with hot and cold trichloroacetic acid solutions and proteolytic enzymes, or with formamide, yielded insoluble fractions which produced the characteristic nodular lesions. The size of the lesion resulting from injection of these fractions was proportional to the amount of the injected material. The active fraction, which does not appear susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme, is thought to be cell wall mucopeptide. Histological studies showed skin abscesses due to the toxic reaction; however, in addition to the acute inflammatory reaction, there was local eosinophilia.
