ti  - murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
ab  - the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
ti  - cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
ab  - background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
ti  - preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
ab  - in this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees c, respectively. many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by scanning electron microscope. furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic ph solution. on the other hand, the visible cells of lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for escherichia coli. furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively. micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
ti  - [effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
ab  - aim: study the effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. materials and methods: 9 h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, micrococcus luteus nctc 2665, escherichia coli state institute of standardization and control no 240367, lactobacillus acidophilus institute of cellular and intracellular symbiosis no 37 were used. ability of lactobacilli to produce h2o2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of m. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of e. coli in endo medium and l. acidophilus--in mrs medium. results: decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. this effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against e. coli and decrease against l. acidophilus. the degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. conclusion: modification of lysozyme by h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
ti  - effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
ab  - to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
ti  - comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
ab  - purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.
ti  - astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts enhance the ifn-beta stimulatory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus in murine-derived dendritic cells.
ab  - many foods and food components boost the immune system, but little data are available regarding the mechanisms by which they do. bacterial strains have disparate effects in stimulating the immune system. in dendritic cells, the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, whereas gram-positive lactobacillus acidophilus induces a robust interferon (ifn)-beta response. the immune-modulating effects of astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts were examined in bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells that were stimulated with l. acidophilus or e. coli. ifn-beta and other cytokines were measured by elisa and rt-pcr. endocytosis of fluorescence-labeled dextran and l. acidophilus in the presence of elderberry fruit or astragalus root extract was evaluated in dendritic cells. our results show that both extracts enhanced l. acidophilus-induced ifn-beta production and slightly decreased the proinflammatory response to e. coli. the enhanced ifn-beta production was associated with upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 and to a varying degree, the cytokines il-12, il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha. both extracts increased endocytosis in immature dendritic cells, and only slightly influenced the viability of the cells. in conclusion, astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts increase the ifn-beta inducing activity of l. acidophilus in dendritic cells, suggesting that they may exert antiviral and immune-enhancing activity.
ti  - yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by lactobacillus acidophilus la-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in mice.
ab  - an active fraction extracted from lactobacillus acidophilus la5 cell-free spent medium (lala-5af) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec). mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. on the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) cfu per mouse) of e. coli o157:h7. the clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. ehec attachment and colonization was attenuated by lala-5af. tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during ehec infection. to investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, lala-5af was tested by reverse transcription real-time pcr to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of ehec o157. the results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of ehec, including stxb2, qsea, luxs, tir, ler, eaea, and hlyb.
ti  - spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
ab  - growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
ti  - effect of lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced precancerous growths in the rat colon.
ab  - lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342, isolated from the korean traditional food kimchi, was investigated for its suitability as a dietary probiotic. the effects of l. acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine; dmh) precancerous cytological changes of the colon were investigated in rats. forty-five male f344 rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups. the control group received a high-fat diet (hf), a second group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen (hfc), and a final group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen and l. acidophilus kfri342 (hfcl). l. acidophilus kfri342 was administered orally three times per week at 2x10(9) c.f.u. ml(-1). l. acidophilus kfri342 treatments decreased the number of escherichia coli in faecal samples, the enzyme activities of beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and plasma triglyceride concentration compared to the hf and hfc treatments (p<0.05). l. acidophilus kfri342 consumption also decreased the ratio of aberrant crypts to aberrant crypt foci incidence and the number of aberrant crypts in hfcl rats. therefore, l. acidophilus showed potential probiotic activity as an inhibitor of dmh-induced symptoms in live rats. our in vivo studies indicate that l. acidophilus from kimchi may be suitable as a probiotic for human use.
ti  - d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
ab  - d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
ti  - bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
ab  - reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
ti  - association of lactobacillus acidophilus with mice peyer's patches.
ab  - objective: to clarify the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus acidophilus to peyer's patches. methods: adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 to mice peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. the nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. the presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. the effect of l. acidophilus fn001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to peyer's patches was also studied. results: the adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of d-mannose and methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. pretreatment of l. acidophilus fn001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. l. acidophilus fn001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the l. acidophilus fn001 surface. in adhesion inhibition assay, l. acidophilus nf001, when applied to peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of escherichia coli atcc25922 to peyer's patches. conclusion: l. acidophilus fn001 contains some mannose-specific protein(s) on its surface that mediates its adhesion to the peyer's patches. fn001 inhibits the adhesion of e. coli, which also contains mannose specific lectin.
ti  - antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
ab  - enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
ti  - inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
ab  - during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
ti  - inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
ab  - the intestinal epithelial cell (iec) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. iecs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. however, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. the principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactobacillus on the upregulation of muc2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 attachment to epithelial cells. in the current study, the attachment of e. coli o157:h7 to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by l. acidophilus a4 and its cell extracts. it is also important to note that the expression of muc2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of l. acidophilus a4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which e. coli o157:h7 attached to epithelial cells. in addition, the mrna levels of il-8, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha in ht-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with l. acidophilus a4 extracts. these results indicate that muc2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of muc2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of e. coli o157:h7.
ti  - an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
ab  - objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria. the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
ti  - the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
ab  - lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.
ti  - comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
ab  - the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
ti  - biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ruminant digestive contents.
ab  - the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease. characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the git and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. we found that growth of e. coli o157:h7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. in fecal suspensions, e. coli o157:h7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. however, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited e. coli o157:h7 growth in fecal suspensions. the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. these lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling o157:h7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant git, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
ti  - casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026.
ab  - three peptides produced by a lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 and escherichia coli dpc5063 were characterized. these peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as ikhqglpqe, vlnenllr, and sdipnpigsensek. these peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to e. sakazakii infection in neonates.
ti  - lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant k99 adhesive fimbriae has an inhibitory effect on adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
ab  - the most common enteric colibacillosis in neonatal and newborns is caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli(etec). colonization of etec in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. in the present study we have engineered lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant k99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs. the expression of k99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using sds-page, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. to evaluate a function of the k99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs. the tests showed that recombinant l. acidophilus, not control l. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against k99+ e. coli in a dose dependent manner. in conclusion, we demonstrated that recombinant k99 fimbriae producing l. acidophilus was able to prevent e. coli binding to intestinal brush border.
ti  - characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
ab  - aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
ti  - [in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
ab  - the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans. the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
ti  - [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
ab  - for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
ti  - testing two lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
ab  - two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus t-135 and lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, salmonella enteritidis and bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
ti  - growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
ab  - lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz. kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus. optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth. however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth. under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli. these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
ti  - prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given lactobacillus direct-fed microbials.
ab  - fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7, the prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in pens and on carcasses and hides, and cattle performance as a result of daily dietary supplementation with lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials (dfms) were evaluated in a feeding trial involving 180 beef steers. steers were evaluated for shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the dfms, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the dfms were fed. gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. lactobacillus acidophilus npc 747 decreased (p < 0.01) the shedding of e. coli o157:h7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. e. coli o157:h7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving l. acidophilus npc 747. in addition, dfm supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the number of e. coli o157:h7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the dfm supplementation period did not differ among treatments. gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (p < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two dfm treatments than for control animals. the results of this study suggest that the feeding of a lactobacillus-based dfm to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.
ti  - comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
ab  - in this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (phema) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (phema-20% dmaema), polyurethane (pu), polypropylene (pp), poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (plga), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (bhk 21) cells and epithelial madine darby kidney (mdbk) cells. biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. the bacteria used were; escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus acidophilus b-13. initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. the adhesion behaviour of s. aureus and s. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. however, the percentage of attached e. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while l. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. the comparative results indicated that the adhesion of bhk and mdbk cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic phema surface and highest on the most hydrophobic pp surface. in contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
ti  - molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
ab  - the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
ti  - effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
ab  - thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21 days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.
ti  - cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
ab  - the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
ti  - [the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
ab  - 10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
ti  - immediate effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli in coculture.
ab  - the in vitro role of lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. a threefold concentrated cell-free extract from l. acidophilus sbt2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among the three strains of l. acidophilus, sbt2062, sbt2071, and sbt2074, only l. acidophilus sbt2074 showed this inhibitory property. these three strains were also tested in coculture with escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. the fermentation could result in complete inhibition of e. coli in 36 h. short-term administration of l. acidophilus sbt2074 in rats with and without e. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. the e. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. the fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when l. acidophilus sbt2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. the analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. the effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that l. acidophilus sbt2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
ti  - effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm ii. changes in the immunological environment.
ab  - to study the effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm, we have established gnotobiotic mice with a single species of intestinal bacteria. in the previous study, the incidence of colonic adenoma induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) in the gnotobiotic mice with lactobacillus acidophilus, gnotobiotic mice with escherichia coli and germ-free mice were 30, 50 and 74%, respectively. in this study, 7-week-old mice in each group were sacrificed without the administration of dmh to examine the constituents of immuno-competent cells in various mouse organs using flow cytometry. in the gnotobiotic mice, cd3 intermediate interleukin (il)-2rbeta positive cells were observed predominantly in the liver. in the gnotobiotic mice with l. acidophilus, mac-1 positive gr-1 positive cells were observed predominantly in the colonic lamina propria. the activation of extrathymic t cells in the liver and granulocytes in the colonic mucosa may be related to anti-neoplastic effects of l. acidophilus in this experimental model.
ti  - probiotic fermented food mixtures: possible applications in clinical anti-diarrhoea usage.
ab  - a probiotic fermented pcmt food mixture was developed by fermentation of an autoclaved and cooled slurry of pearl millet flour, chickpea flour, skim milk powder and fresh tomato pulp (pcmt 2:1:1:1, w/w) with lactobacillus acidophilus (10(5) cells/ml), a probiotic organism at 37 degrees c for 24 h. such a fermented mixture inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms, namely shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhosa and e. coli. a significant decline in ph with a corresponding increase in titratable acidity due to probiotic fermentation occurred in the developed food mixture. feeding of the freshly developed fermented mixture to mice suffering from e. coli induced diarrhoea, could help to arrest diarrhoea, reduce moisture, protein and ash contents in their faeces. the counts of lactobacilli increased whereas those of e. coli decreased remarkably in the faeces of mice from the 3rd day of the feeding trial till the end of experimental period. the beneficial effect of probiotic feeding may be due to antimicrobial substances produced by l. acidophilus, which might have neutralized the enterotoxins from e. coli. the cost of one 200 ml glass full of this probiotic drink is no more than one rupee.
ti  - antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
ab  - lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica. however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
ti  - antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
ab  - the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
ti  - growth of lactobacilli, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
ab  - the growth of three lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and l. casei), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus 6032 and l. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. s. aureus 26003 and e. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. these mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. among the lactobacilli, l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus grew faster than l. casei in both types of milk samples. all the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. however, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of l. casei. pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. all the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
ti  - competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) from human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells by heat-killed lactobacillus.
ab  - diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) bearing cfa/i or cfa/ii adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal caco-2 cells in culture. heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb, that adheres onto caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. since the l. acidophilus does not express etec-cfa adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed l. acidophilus lb cells inhibit diarrheagenic e. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic etec receptors.
ti  - heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
ab  - escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
ti  - detection of a lactobacillus substance that inhibits escherichia coli.
ab  - recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. this interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. in the present study, lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant escherichia coli hu 734 and e. coli atcc 25922. the bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain gr-1 was retained under ph buffered conditions and was bactericidal. the bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. the data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the e. coli. the ability of l. casei gr-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
ti  - in vivo inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus against pathogenic escherichia coli in gnotobiotic chicks.
ab  - chicks were hatched germfree in gnotobiotic isolators to determine the inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus towards pathogeneic escherichia coli in vivo. twelve trials were conducted in two flexible film isolators utilizing a total of 221 chicks. one treatment consisted of inoculating 2-day-old chicks with l. acidophilus, then challenging with pathogenic e. coli with subsequent dosing with l. acidophilus. the other treatment consisted of challenging with the e. coli at 2 days of age, then subsequently dosing with l. acidophilus. statistical analysis of the data showed initial dosing with l. acidophilus prevented excessive mortality when chicks were challenged with e. coli. also, continued dosing with l. acidophilus lowered the ph in the crop, cecum, and rectum whether chicks were initially given l. acidophilus or e. coli. this strain of l. acidophilus was capable of competing with e. coli in the gut of gnotobiotic chicks.
ti  - the formation of germtubes by candida albicans, when grown with staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacilius acidophilus and proteus vulgaris.
ab  - the formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of c. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: staphylococcus pyegene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus acidophilus and proteus vulgaris. all the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by c. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by c. albicans. since germtubes of c. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by c. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.
ti  - murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
ab  - the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
ti  - cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
ab  - background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
ti  - preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
ab  - in this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees c, respectively. many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by scanning electron microscope. furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic ph solution. on the other hand, the visible cells of lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for escherichia coli. furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively. micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
ti  - [effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
ab  - aim: study the effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. materials and methods: 9 h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, micrococcus luteus nctc 2665, escherichia coli state institute of standardization and control no 240367, lactobacillus acidophilus institute of cellular and intracellular symbiosis no 37 were used. ability of lactobacilli to produce h2o2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of m. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of e. coli in endo medium and l. acidophilus--in mrs medium. results: decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. this effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against e. coli and decrease against l. acidophilus. the degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. conclusion: modification of lysozyme by h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
ti  - effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
ab  - to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
ti  - comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
ab  - purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.
ti  - astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts enhance the ifn-beta stimulatory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus in murine-derived dendritic cells.
ab  - many foods and food components boost the immune system, but little data are available regarding the mechanisms by which they do. bacterial strains have disparate effects in stimulating the immune system. in dendritic cells, the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, whereas gram-positive lactobacillus acidophilus induces a robust interferon (ifn)-beta response. the immune-modulating effects of astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts were examined in bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells that were stimulated with l. acidophilus or e. coli. ifn-beta and other cytokines were measured by elisa and rt-pcr. endocytosis of fluorescence-labeled dextran and l. acidophilus in the presence of elderberry fruit or astragalus root extract was evaluated in dendritic cells. our results show that both extracts enhanced l. acidophilus-induced ifn-beta production and slightly decreased the proinflammatory response to e. coli. the enhanced ifn-beta production was associated with upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 and to a varying degree, the cytokines il-12, il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha. both extracts increased endocytosis in immature dendritic cells, and only slightly influenced the viability of the cells. in conclusion, astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts increase the ifn-beta inducing activity of l. acidophilus in dendritic cells, suggesting that they may exert antiviral and immune-enhancing activity.
ti  - yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by lactobacillus acidophilus la-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in mice.
ab  - an active fraction extracted from lactobacillus acidophilus la5 cell-free spent medium (lala-5af) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec). mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. on the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) cfu per mouse) of e. coli o157:h7. the clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. ehec attachment and colonization was attenuated by lala-5af. tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during ehec infection. to investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, lala-5af was tested by reverse transcription real-time pcr to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of ehec o157. the results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of ehec, including stxb2, qsea, luxs, tir, ler, eaea, and hlyb.
ti  - spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
ab  - growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
ti  - effect of lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced precancerous growths in the rat colon.
ab  - lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342, isolated from the korean traditional food kimchi, was investigated for its suitability as a dietary probiotic. the effects of l. acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine; dmh) precancerous cytological changes of the colon were investigated in rats. forty-five male f344 rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups. the control group received a high-fat diet (hf), a second group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen (hfc), and a final group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen and l. acidophilus kfri342 (hfcl). l. acidophilus kfri342 was administered orally three times per week at 2x10(9) c.f.u. ml(-1). l. acidophilus kfri342 treatments decreased the number of escherichia coli in faecal samples, the enzyme activities of beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and plasma triglyceride concentration compared to the hf and hfc treatments (p<0.05). l. acidophilus kfri342 consumption also decreased the ratio of aberrant crypts to aberrant crypt foci incidence and the number of aberrant crypts in hfcl rats. therefore, l. acidophilus showed potential probiotic activity as an inhibitor of dmh-induced symptoms in live rats. our in vivo studies indicate that l. acidophilus from kimchi may be suitable as a probiotic for human use.
ti  - d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
ab  - d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
ti  - bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
ab  - reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
ti  - association of lactobacillus acidophilus with mice peyer's patches.
ab  - objective: to clarify the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus acidophilus to peyer's patches. methods: adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 to mice peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. the nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. the presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. the effect of l. acidophilus fn001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to peyer's patches was also studied. results: the adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of d-mannose and methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. pretreatment of l. acidophilus fn001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. l. acidophilus fn001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the l. acidophilus fn001 surface. in adhesion inhibition assay, l. acidophilus nf001, when applied to peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of escherichia coli atcc25922 to peyer's patches. conclusion: l. acidophilus fn001 contains some mannose-specific protein(s) on its surface that mediates its adhesion to the peyer's patches. fn001 inhibits the adhesion of e. coli, which also contains mannose specific lectin.
ti  - antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
ab  - enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
ti  - inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
ab  - during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
ti  - inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
ab  - the intestinal epithelial cell (iec) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. iecs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. however, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. the principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactobacillus on the upregulation of muc2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 attachment to epithelial cells. in the current study, the attachment of e. coli o157:h7 to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by l. acidophilus a4 and its cell extracts. it is also important to note that the expression of muc2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of l. acidophilus a4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which e. coli o157:h7 attached to epithelial cells. in addition, the mrna levels of il-8, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha in ht-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with l. acidophilus a4 extracts. these results indicate that muc2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of muc2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of e. coli o157:h7.
ti  - an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
ab  - objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria. the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
ti  - the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
ab  - lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.
ti  - comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
ab  - the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
ti  - biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ruminant digestive contents.
ab  - the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease. characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the git and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. we found that growth of e. coli o157:h7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. in fecal suspensions, e. coli o157:h7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. however, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited e. coli o157:h7 growth in fecal suspensions. the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. these lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling o157:h7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant git, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
ti  - casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026.
ab  - three peptides produced by a lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 and escherichia coli dpc5063 were characterized. these peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as ikhqglpqe, vlnenllr, and sdipnpigsensek. these peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to e. sakazakii infection in neonates.
ti  - lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant k99 adhesive fimbriae has an inhibitory effect on adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
ab  - the most common enteric colibacillosis in neonatal and newborns is caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli(etec). colonization of etec in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. in the present study we have engineered lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant k99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs. the expression of k99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using sds-page, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. to evaluate a function of the k99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs. the tests showed that recombinant l. acidophilus, not control l. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against k99+ e. coli in a dose dependent manner. in conclusion, we demonstrated that recombinant k99 fimbriae producing l. acidophilus was able to prevent e. coli binding to intestinal brush border.
ti  - characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
ab  - aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
ti  - [in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
ab  - the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans. the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
ti  - [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
ab  - for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
ti  - testing two lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
ab  - two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus t-135 and lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, salmonella enteritidis and bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
ti  - growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
ab  - lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz. kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus. optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth. however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth. under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli. these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
ti  - prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given lactobacillus direct-fed microbials.
ab  - fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7, the prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in pens and on carcasses and hides, and cattle performance as a result of daily dietary supplementation with lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials (dfms) were evaluated in a feeding trial involving 180 beef steers. steers were evaluated for shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the dfms, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the dfms were fed. gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. lactobacillus acidophilus npc 747 decreased (p < 0.01) the shedding of e. coli o157:h7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. e. coli o157:h7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving l. acidophilus npc 747. in addition, dfm supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the number of e. coli o157:h7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the dfm supplementation period did not differ among treatments. gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (p < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two dfm treatments than for control animals. the results of this study suggest that the feeding of a lactobacillus-based dfm to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.
ti  - comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
ab  - in this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (phema) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (phema-20% dmaema), polyurethane (pu), polypropylene (pp), poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (plga), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (bhk 21) cells and epithelial madine darby kidney (mdbk) cells. biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. the bacteria used were; escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus acidophilus b-13. initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. the adhesion behaviour of s. aureus and s. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. however, the percentage of attached e. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while l. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. the comparative results indicated that the adhesion of bhk and mdbk cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic phema surface and highest on the most hydrophobic pp surface. in contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
ti  - molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
ab  - the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
ti  - effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
ab  - thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21 days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.
ti  - cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
ab  - the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
ti  - [the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
ab  - 10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
ti  - immediate effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli in coculture.
ab  - the in vitro role of lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. a threefold concentrated cell-free extract from l. acidophilus sbt2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among the three strains of l. acidophilus, sbt2062, sbt2071, and sbt2074, only l. acidophilus sbt2074 showed this inhibitory property. these three strains were also tested in coculture with escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. the fermentation could result in complete inhibition of e. coli in 36 h. short-term administration of l. acidophilus sbt2074 in rats with and without e. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. the e. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. the fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when l. acidophilus sbt2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. the analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. the effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that l. acidophilus sbt2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
ti  - effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm ii. changes in the immunological environment.
ab  - to study the effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm, we have established gnotobiotic mice with a single species of intestinal bacteria. in the previous study, the incidence of colonic adenoma induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) in the gnotobiotic mice with lactobacillus acidophilus, gnotobiotic mice with escherichia coli and germ-free mice were 30, 50 and 74%, respectively. in this study, 7-week-old mice in each group were sacrificed without the administration of dmh to examine the constituents of immuno-competent cells in various mouse organs using flow cytometry. in the gnotobiotic mice, cd3 intermediate interleukin (il)-2rbeta positive cells were observed predominantly in the liver. in the gnotobiotic mice with l. acidophilus, mac-1 positive gr-1 positive cells were observed predominantly in the colonic lamina propria. the activation of extrathymic t cells in the liver and granulocytes in the colonic mucosa may be related to anti-neoplastic effects of l. acidophilus in this experimental model.
ti  - probiotic fermented food mixtures: possible applications in clinical anti-diarrhoea usage.
ab  - a probiotic fermented pcmt food mixture was developed by fermentation of an autoclaved and cooled slurry of pearl millet flour, chickpea flour, skim milk powder and fresh tomato pulp (pcmt 2:1:1:1, w/w) with lactobacillus acidophilus (10(5) cells/ml), a probiotic organism at 37 degrees c for 24 h. such a fermented mixture inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms, namely shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhosa and e. coli. a significant decline in ph with a corresponding increase in titratable acidity due to probiotic fermentation occurred in the developed food mixture. feeding of the freshly developed fermented mixture to mice suffering from e. coli induced diarrhoea, could help to arrest diarrhoea, reduce moisture, protein and ash contents in their faeces. the counts of lactobacilli increased whereas those of e. coli decreased remarkably in the faeces of mice from the 3rd day of the feeding trial till the end of experimental period. the beneficial effect of probiotic feeding may be due to antimicrobial substances produced by l. acidophilus, which might have neutralized the enterotoxins from e. coli. the cost of one 200 ml glass full of this probiotic drink is no more than one rupee.
ti  - antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
ab  - lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica. however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
ti  - antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
ab  - the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
ti  - growth of lactobacilli, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
ab  - the growth of three lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and l. casei), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus 6032 and l. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. s. aureus 26003 and e. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. these mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. among the lactobacilli, l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus grew faster than l. casei in both types of milk samples. all the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. however, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of l. casei. pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. all the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
ti  - competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) from human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells by heat-killed lactobacillus.
ab  - diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) bearing cfa/i or cfa/ii adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal caco-2 cells in culture. heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb, that adheres onto caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. since the l. acidophilus does not express etec-cfa adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed l. acidophilus lb cells inhibit diarrheagenic e. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic etec receptors.
ti  - heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
ab  - escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
ti  - detection of a lactobacillus substance that inhibits escherichia coli.
ab  - recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. this interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. in the present study, lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant escherichia coli hu 734 and e. coli atcc 25922. the bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain gr-1 was retained under ph buffered conditions and was bactericidal. the bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. the data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the e. coli. the ability of l. casei gr-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
ti  - in vivo inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus against pathogenic escherichia coli in gnotobiotic chicks.
ab  - chicks were hatched germfree in gnotobiotic isolators to determine the inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus towards pathogeneic escherichia coli in vivo. twelve trials were conducted in two flexible film isolators utilizing a total of 221 chicks. one treatment consisted of inoculating 2-day-old chicks with l. acidophilus, then challenging with pathogenic e. coli with subsequent dosing with l. acidophilus. the other treatment consisted of challenging with the e. coli at 2 days of age, then subsequently dosing with l. acidophilus. statistical analysis of the data showed initial dosing with l. acidophilus prevented excessive mortality when chicks were challenged with e. coli. also, continued dosing with l. acidophilus lowered the ph in the crop, cecum, and rectum whether chicks were initially given l. acidophilus or e. coli. this strain of l. acidophilus was capable of competing with e. coli in the gut of gnotobiotic chicks.
ti  - the formation of germtubes by candida albicans, when grown with staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacilius acidophilus and proteus vulgaris.
ab  - the formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of c. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: staphylococcus pyegene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus acidophilus and proteus vulgaris. all the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by c. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by c. albicans. since germtubes of c. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by c. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.
ti  - murein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from lactobacillus acidophilus against escherichia coli.
ab  - the aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (slps) from two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography. the influence of these hydrolase activities on escherichia coli atcc 43893 was also evaluated by analysing their growth curve, cell morphology and physiological state. after the incubation of e. coli with slps, growth was inhibited, the number of viable cells was significantly reduced, examination by transmission electron microscopy showed that the cell wall was damaged and flow cytometry results indicated that the majority of the cells were sublethally injured. all of these results suggested that the slps of both l. acidophilus strains possessed murein hydrolase activities that were sublethal to e. coli cells.
ti  - cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
ab  - background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions; hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46 and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.
ti  - preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotics for dogs.
ab  - in this article, preparation and application characteristics of microencapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus were investigated. results indicated that the optimum condition for preparation of micro encapsulation were 10% (w/v) wall material and the temperature of 20 degrees c, respectively. many micropores in the porous starch micro particles was also observed by scanning electron microscope. furthermore, the released cell counts were increase from 2.43 log cfu/g to 9.17 log cfu/g for the time prolong to 3h in the simulated colonic ph solution. on the other hand, the visible cells of lactobacillus acidophilus in the dog feces on the 10th day after the probiotics feeding was improve about 34.8% compare to the before feeding, which was decrease about 24.6%for escherichia coli. furthermore, the content of is ovaleric acid, indole and 3-methylindole, putrefactive substances in dog feces, before feeding were reduce 24%, 16% and 45% in dog feces on the 10th day after feeding compared to that before feeding, respectively. micro encapsulation can be considered a useful technology to provide the protection for lactobacillus acidophilus and better application effective.
ti  - [effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on functional activity of lysozyme].
ab  - aim: study the effect of metabolites of h2o2-producing lactobacilli on enzymatic  and bactericidal activity of lysozyme. materials and methods: 9 h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli, micrococcus luteus nctc 2665, escherichia coli state institute of standardization and control no 240367, lactobacillus acidophilus institute of cellular and intracellular symbiosis no 37 were used. ability of lactobacilli to produce h2o2 was evaluated by oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine by peroxidase. lysozyme was modified by mixing with equal volumes of lactobacilli metabolites, metabolites of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli previously treated with catalase were used in control. lysozyme enzymatic activity was determined by speed of m. luteus lysis, bactericidal--by survivability of e. coli in endo medium and l. acidophilus--in mrs medium. results: decrease of enzymatic activity of lysozyme due to its contact with h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites was detected. this effect is accompanied by growth of bactericidal activity of lysozyme against e. coli and decrease against l. acidophilus. the degree of changes of enzymatic and bactericidal activity of lysozyme by lactobacilli metabolites depended on concentration of hydrogen peroxide in them. conclusion: modification of lysozyme by h2o2-producing lactobacilli metabolites resulting in opposite changes of its activity against autochthonous and allchthonous bacteria is one of the mechanisms of formation of stable microbial biocenosis in human organism.
ti  - effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
ab  - to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
ti  - comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
ab  - purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.
ti  - astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts enhance the ifn-beta stimulatory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus in murine-derived dendritic cells.
ab  - many foods and food components boost the immune system, but little data are available regarding the mechanisms by which they do. bacterial strains have disparate effects in stimulating the immune system. in dendritic cells, the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli upregulates proinflammatory cytokines, whereas gram-positive lactobacillus acidophilus induces a robust interferon (ifn)-beta response. the immune-modulating effects of astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts were examined in bone marrow-derived murine dendritic cells that were stimulated with l. acidophilus or e. coli. ifn-beta and other cytokines were measured by elisa and rt-pcr. endocytosis of fluorescence-labeled dextran and l. acidophilus in the presence of elderberry fruit or astragalus root extract was evaluated in dendritic cells. our results show that both extracts enhanced l. acidophilus-induced ifn-beta production and slightly decreased the proinflammatory response to e. coli. the enhanced ifn-beta production was associated with upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 and to a varying degree, the cytokines il-12, il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha. both extracts increased endocytosis in immature dendritic cells, and only slightly influenced the viability of the cells. in conclusion, astragalus root and elderberry fruit extracts increase the ifn-beta inducing activity of l. acidophilus in dendritic cells, suggesting that they may exert antiviral and immune-enhancing activity.
ti  - yogurt containing bioactive molecules produced by lactobacillus acidophilus la-5  exerts a protective effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in mice.
ab  - an active fraction extracted from lactobacillus acidophilus la5 cell-free spent medium (lala-5af) was incorporated in a dairy matrix and tested to assess its antivirulent effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec). mice in experimental groups were fed for 4 days with yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. on the fifth day, mice were challenged with a single dose (10(7) cfu per mouse) of e. coli o157:h7. the clinical manifestations of the infection were significantly less severe in mice fed the yogurt supplemented with lala-5af. ehec attachment and colonization was attenuated by lala-5af. tumor necrosis factor alpha production was down-regulated, which might indicate a protective effect in the kidney during ehec infection. to investigate the mechanisms associated with the in vivo effects observed, lala-5af was tested by reverse transcription real-time pcr to confirm its effects on the expression of several virulence genes of ehec o157. the results showed that these fractions were able to down-regulate several virulence genes of ehec, including stxb2, qsea, luxs, tir, ler, eaea, and hlyb.
ti  - spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
ab  - growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
ti  - effect of lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced precancerous growths in the rat colon.
ab  - lactobacillus acidophilus kfri342, isolated from the korean traditional food kimchi, was investigated for its suitability as a dietary probiotic. the effects of l. acidophilus kfri342 on the development of chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine; dmh) precancerous cytological changes of the colon were investigated in rats. forty-five male f344 rats were randomly divided into three dietary groups. the control group received a high-fat diet (hf), a second group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen (hfc), and a final group received a high-fat diet containing the carcinogen and l. acidophilus kfri342 (hfcl). l. acidophilus kfri342 was administered orally three times per week at 2x10(9) c.f.u. ml(-1). l. acidophilus kfri342 treatments decreased the number of escherichia coli in faecal samples, the enzyme activities of beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase, and plasma triglyceride concentration compared to the hf and hfc treatments (p<0.05). l. acidophilus kfri342 consumption also decreased the ratio of aberrant crypts to aberrant crypt foci incidence and the number of aberrant crypts in hfcl rats. therefore, l. acidophilus showed potential probiotic activity as an inhibitor of dmh-induced symptoms in live rats. our in vivo studies indicate that l. acidophilus from kimchi may be suitable as a probiotic for human use.
ti  - d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
ab  - d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
ti  - bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
ab  - reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.
ti  - association of lactobacillus acidophilus with mice peyer's patches.
ab  - objective: to clarify the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus acidophilus to peyer's patches. methods: adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 to mice peyer's patches was studied in vitro using a fluorescent quantization method. the nature of adhesion mediator was studied by the differing effects of physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments of the bacteria and the inhibitory effects of sugars on the adhesion. the presence of lectin-like proteins on the cell surface was determined by hemagglutination assay. the effect of l. acidophilus fn001 on the inhibition of adhesion of pathogens to peyer's patches was also studied. results: the adhesion of l. acidophilus fn001 was strongly inhibited in the presence of d-mannose and methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. pretreatment of l. acidophilus fn001 with pepsin and trypsin decreased the adhesive capacity indicating that some cell surface proteins might be involved in the adhesion. l. acidophilus fn001 showed agglutinating activity toward the rabbit red cells in a mannose specific manner, which was decreased after protease pretreatment, suggesting possible occurrence of mannose specific lectin(s) on the l. acidophilus fn001 surface. in adhesion inhibition assay, l. acidophilus nf001, when applied to peyer's patches first or at the same time with pathogen, significantly inhibited adhesion of escherichia coli atcc25922 to peyer's patches. conclusion: l. acidophilus fn001 contains some mannose-specific protein(s) on its surface that mediates its adhesion to the peyer's patches. fn001 inhibits the adhesion of e. coli, which also contains mannose specific lectin.
ti  - antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus ry2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
ab  - enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on eaggec infection remains unclear. in this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several eaggec stains. while three isolates, lactobacillus acidophilus ry2, lactobacillus salivarius mm1 and lactobacillus paracasei en4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of eaggec. in addition, the antagonistic activity of the lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees c, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (cfcs). the antagonistic activity of the cfcs however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at ph 7.2. furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, l. acidophilus ry2 was shown to be more effective than l. salivarius mm1 and l. paracasei en4. this study suggests that l. acidophilus ry2 could be used as a probiotic organism against eaggec.
ti  - inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
ab  - during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e. coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307 lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.
ti  - inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 attachment by interactions between lactic  acid bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells.
ab  - the intestinal epithelial cell (iec) layer of the intestinal tract makes direct contact with a number of microbiota communities, including bacteria known to have deleterious health effects. iecs possess innate protective strategies against pathogenic challenge, which primarily involve the formation of a physicochemical barrier. intestinal tract mucins are principal components of the mucus layer on epithelial surfaces, and perform a protective function against microbial damage. however, little is currently known regarding the interactions between probiotics/pathogens and epithelial cell mucins. the principal objective of this study was to determine the effects of lactobacillus on the upregulation of muc2 mucin and the subsequent inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 attachment to epithelial cells. in the current study, the attachment of e. coli o157:h7 to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells was inhibited significantly by l. acidophilus a4 and its cell extracts. it is also important to note that the expression of muc2 mucin was increased as the result of the addition of l. acidophilus a4 cell extracts (10.0 mg/ml), which also induced a significant reduction in the degree to which e. coli o157:h7 attached to epithelial cells. in addition, the mrna levels of il-8, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha in ht-29 cells were significantly induced by treatment with l. acidophilus a4 extracts. these results indicate that muc2 mucin and cytokines are important regulatory factors in the immune systems of the gut, and that selected lactobacilli may be able to induce the upregulation of muc2 mucin and specific cytokines, thereby inhibiting the attachment of e. coli o157:h7.
ti  - an experimental study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb against nonrotavirus diarrhea.
ab  - objective: previous studies have shown that selected strains of lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. however, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. this study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. methods: the activity of a culture of l. acidophilus lb or of the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal caco-2/tc7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli c1845 bacteria. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. results: infection of the cells with c1845 bacteria that were treated with l. acidophilus lb culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent decrease in the number of fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated c1845 bacteria. the clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed l. acidophilus lb bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. conclusions: heat-killed l. acidophilus lb plus its culture medium antagonizes the c1845-induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal caco-2/tc7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea.
ti  - the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
ab  - lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.
ti  - comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
ab  - the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
ti  - biotic and abiotic factors influencing in vitro growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 in ruminant digestive contents.
ab  - the gastrointestinal tract (git) of ruminants is the main reservoir of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, which is responsible for food-borne infections in humans that can lead to severe kidney disease. characterization of biotic and abiotic factors that influence the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help in the development of ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the git and to decrease the risk of contamination of animal products. we found that growth of e. coli o157:h7 in rumen fluid was inhibited by the autochthonous microflora. growth was also reduced when rumen fluid came from sheep fed a mixed diet composed of 50% wheat and 50% hay, as opposed to a 100% hay diet. in fecal suspensions, e. coli o157:h7 growth was not suppressed by the autochthonous flora. however, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited e. coli o157:h7 growth in fecal suspensions. the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. these lactic acid bacteria could be a relevant tool for controlling o157:h7 development in the terminal part of the ruminant git, which has been shown to be the main site of colonization by these pathogenic bacteria.
ti  - casein-derived antimicrobial peptides generated by lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026.
ab  - three peptides produced by a lactobacillus acidophilus dpc6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains enterobacter sakazakii atcc 12868 and escherichia coli dpc5063 were characterized. these peptides were all generated from bovine alpha(s1)-casein and identified as ikhqglpqe, vlnenllr, and sdipnpigsensek. these peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to e. sakazakii infection in neonates.
ti  - lactobacillus acidophilus expressing recombinant k99 adhesive fimbriae has an inhibitory effect on adhesion of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
ab  - the most common enteric colibacillosis in neonatal and newborns is caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli(etec). colonization of etec in the small intestine is associated with adhesions using fimbriae, which is known as a specific adhesion factor and provides highly specific means for anchoring and prerequisite for an infectious agent. in the present study we have engineered lactobacillus acidophilus to produce recombinant k99 fimbriae, which is used for the colonization to the intestine of pigs. the expression of k99 fimbrial protein was confirmed using sds-page, immunoblot and agglutination analyses. to evaluate a function of the k99 fimbrial protein, inhibition and competition tests were performed on pre-screened intestinal brush border from pigs. the tests showed that recombinant l. acidophilus, not control l. acidophilus, had a significant inhibitory effect to and competition against k99+ e. coli in a dose dependent manner. in conclusion, we demonstrated that recombinant k99 fimbriae producing l. acidophilus was able to prevent e. coli binding to intestinal brush border.
ti  - characterization of a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium gm-1 isolated  from an infant.
ab  - aim: to partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the gm-1 strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. methods and results: the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium gm-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio spp., salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. treatment of the gm-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. the bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees c for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral ph. the optimal production of bacteriocin from e. faecium gm-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were ph 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees c. the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. the use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. a bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin p was identified from the total dna of e. faecium gm-1 by pcr and direct sequencing methods. conclusion: e. faecium gm-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin p-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. significance and impact of the study: e. faecium gm-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin p. this bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
ti  - [in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
ab  - the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans. the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
ti  - [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
ab  - for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
ti  - testing two lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
ab  - two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus t-135 and lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, salmonella enteritidis and bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
ti  - growth and lactic acid production by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259,  and inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli.
ab  - lactic acid-producing lactobacilli were selected from 134 human vaginal isolates  by testing their capability to inhibit the growth of different pathogenic micro-organisms. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 (from the cerela culture collection) was selected to study the effects of temperature, ph and culture medium on growth and lactic acid production. growth parameters were estimated by using the model of gompertz. kinetics of inhibition of uropathogenic escherichia coli were evaluated in mixed cultures of the pathogen and l. acidophilus. optimal conditions for growth and lactic acid production by l. acidophilus were ph 6.5 or 8.0 and 37 degrees c. under these conditions, growth was higher in laptg (yeast extract/peptone/tryptone/tween 80/glucose) broth than in mrs (de man-rogosa-sharpe) broth. however, lactic acid production was more efficient in mrs broth. under optimal conditions for lactic acid production, l. acidophilus inhibited the growth of e. coli. these results suggest that inclusion of l. acidophilus crl 1259 in probiotic products for vaginal application would be beneficial.
ti  - prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and performance by beef feedlot cattle given lactobacillus direct-fed microbials.
ab  - fecal shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7, the prevalence of escherichia coli o157:h7 in pens and on carcasses and hides, and cattle performance as a result of daily dietary supplementation with lactobacillus-based direct-fed microbials (dfms) were evaluated in a feeding trial involving 180 beef steers. steers were evaluated for shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by an immunomagnetic separation technique on arrival at the feedlot, just before treatment with the dfms, and every 14 days thereafter until slaughter. composite pen fecal samples were collected every 14 days (alternating weeks with animal testing), and prevalence on hides and carcasses at slaughter was also evaluated. feedlot performance (body weight gain and feed intake) was measured for the period during which the dfms were fed. gain efficiency was calculated as the ratio of weight gain to feed intake. lactobacillus acidophilus npc 747 decreased (p < 0.01) the shedding of e. coli o157:h7 in the feces of individual cattle during the feeding period. e. coli o157:h7 was approximately twice as likely to be detected in control animal samples as in samples from animals receiving l. acidophilus npc 747. in addition, dfm supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the number of e. coli o157:h7-positive hide samples at harvest and the number of pens testing positive for the pathogen. body weight gains (on a live or carcass basis) and feed intakes during the dfm supplementation period did not differ among treatments. gain efficiencies on a live-weight basis did not differ among treatments, but carcass-based gain/feed ratios tended (p < 0.06) to be better for animals receiving the two dfm treatments than for control animals. the results of this study suggest that the feeding of a lactobacillus-based dfm to cattle will decrease, but not eliminate, fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7, as well as contamination on hides, without detrimental effects on performance.
ti  - comparison of bacterial and tissue cell initial adhesion on hydrophilic/hydrophobic biomaterials.
ab  - in this study, interactions of widely-used polymeric biomaterials, i.e. poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (phema) and its copolymer with dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (phema-20% dmaema), polyurethane (pu), polypropylene (pp), poly(vinyl chloride) (pvc), and poly(lactide-glycolide) (plga), with three pathogenic bacteria and one nonpathogen were investigated comparatively with the adhesion of two tissue cells in different morphologies, i.e. fibroblast-like baby hamster kidney (bhk 21) cells and epithelial madine darby kidney (mdbk) cells. biomaterials were prepared in the membrane form by bulk polymerization or solvent casting. surface characterization studies showed that these polymers have different surface free energies in the range of 26.9-63.1 erg cm(-2) and they have smooth surfaces. the bacteria used were; escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus acidophilus b-13. initial adhesion of bacteria to the polymeric surfaces was examined under static conditions and in a laminar flow cell. the adhesion behaviour of s. aureus and s. epidermidis was found independent of the polymeric surface hydrophobicity. however, the percentage of attached e. coli decreased when increasing the surface free energy of the polymer, while l. acidophilus showed just the opposite behaviour. the comparative results indicated that the adhesion of bhk and mdbk cell was lowest on the most hydrophilic phema surface and highest on the most hydrophobic pp surface. in contrast to the case of bacterial adhesion, no relationship was found between polymer hydrophobicity and mammalian cell adherence.
ti  - molecular analysis of mutated lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence p15.
ab  - the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.
ti  - effect of supplements with lactic acid bacteria and oligofructose on the intestinal microflora during administration of cefpodoxime proxetil.
ab  - thirty healthy volunteers in three groups participated in a study of the effect on the intestinal microflora of oral supplementation with bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus and oligofructose, an indigestible oligosaccharide, during oral administration of cefpodoxime proxetil bd for 7 days. those in group a also received an oral supplement with c.1011 cfu of b. longum bb 536 and l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and 15 g oligofructose daily, those in group b received a supplement with oligofructose only and those in group c received placebo, for 21 days. in all three groups there was a marked decrease in aerobic microorganisms, involving mainly a rapid and almost complete disappearance of escherichia coli (p: < 0.05) during antimicrobial administration and, thereafter, an overgrowth of enterococci (p: < 0.05). the number of intestinal yeasts also increased significantly (p: < 0.05) in groups a and b over the same period. there was a dramatic decrease in anaerobic microorganisms on day 4 of administration, mainly caused by loss of bifidobacteria (p: < 0.05) in all groups. the number of lactobacilli also decreased but was significantly higher in group a than in group c at the end of cefpodoxime proxetil administration. clostridium difficile was found in only one person from group a, but six persons each in groups b and c. of the bifidobacterial strains isolated from the faecal samples in group a, one was similar to the strain of b. longum administered, but most volunteers were colonized by several different strains of b. longum during the investigation period. the administered strain of l. acidophilus was recovered from six patients in group a.
ti  - cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
ab  - the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
ti  - [the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
ab  - 10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
ti  - immediate effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the intestinal flora and fecal enzymes of rats and the in vitro inhibition of escherichia coli in coculture.
ab  - the in vitro role of lactobacillus acidophilus was investigated to explore the potential to inhibit coliforms. a threefold concentrated cell-free extract from l. acidophilus sbt2074 could efficiently inhibit most of the tested gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. among the three strains of l. acidophilus, sbt2062, sbt2071, and sbt2074, only l. acidophilus sbt2074 showed this inhibitory property. these three strains were also tested in coculture with escherichia coli 3544 in skim milk medium. the fermentation could result in complete inhibition of e. coli in 36 h. short-term administration of l. acidophilus sbt2074 in rats with and without e. coli resulted in significant inhibition of coliforms and anaerobes. the e. coli infected rats regained the normal flora in the presence of lactic acid bacteria. the fecal enzyme beta-glucuronidase activity was also decreased significantly when l. acidophilus sbt2074 was administered and was related to the decreased number of bacteria in the intestinal tract. the analysis of the small intestinal contents showed that the concentrations of coliforms in the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum were significantly reduced by the administration of lactic acid bacteria. the effects are seen in a short period, suggesting that l. acidophilus sbt2074 fermentate may have clinical application for people suffering from gastrointestinal distress caused by coliforms.
ti  - effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm ii. changes in the immunological environment.
ab  - to study the effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm, we have established gnotobiotic mice with a single species of intestinal bacteria. in the previous study, the incidence of colonic adenoma induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) in the gnotobiotic mice with lactobacillus acidophilus, gnotobiotic mice with escherichia coli and germ-free mice were 30, 50 and 74%, respectively. in this study, 7-week-old mice in each group were sacrificed without the administration of dmh to examine the constituents of immuno-competent cells in various mouse organs using flow cytometry. in the gnotobiotic mice, cd3 intermediate interleukin (il)-2rbeta positive cells were observed predominantly in the liver. in the gnotobiotic mice with l. acidophilus, mac-1 positive gr-1 positive cells were observed predominantly in the colonic lamina propria. the activation of extrathymic t cells in the liver and granulocytes in the colonic mucosa may be related to anti-neoplastic effects of l. acidophilus in this experimental model.
ti  - probiotic fermented food mixtures: possible applications in clinical anti-diarrhoea usage.
ab  - a probiotic fermented pcmt food mixture was developed by fermentation of an autoclaved and cooled slurry of pearl millet flour, chickpea flour, skim milk powder and fresh tomato pulp (pcmt 2:1:1:1, w/w) with lactobacillus acidophilus (10(5) cells/ml), a probiotic organism at 37 degrees c for 24 h. such a fermented mixture inhibited the growth of pathogenic organisms, namely shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhosa and e. coli. a significant decline in ph with a corresponding increase in titratable acidity due to probiotic fermentation occurred in the developed food mixture. feeding of the freshly developed fermented mixture to mice suffering from e. coli induced diarrhoea, could help to arrest diarrhoea, reduce moisture, protein and ash contents in their faeces. the counts of lactobacilli increased whereas those of e. coli decreased remarkably in the faeces of mice from the 3rd day of the feeding trial till the end of experimental period. the beneficial effect of probiotic feeding may be due to antimicrobial substances produced by l. acidophilus, which might have neutralized the enterotoxins from e. coli. the cost of one 200 ml glass full of this probiotic drink is no more than one rupee.
ti  - antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus fermented milk against different pathogenic bacteria.
ab  - lactobacillus acidophilus strains tested showed inhibitory activity towards salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris and yersinia enterocolitica. however, wide variations in the activity of the strains were observed. antagonistic activity of the strains exhibited high heat stability (120 min at 92 degrees c, 15 min at 121 degrees c) but it was markedly influenced by changes in ph. effect of kind of milk on antagonistic activity was variable, whereas skimming had no significant effect.
ti  - antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
ab  - the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
ti  - growth of lactobacilli, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
ab  - the growth of three lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and l. casei), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus 6032 and l. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. s. aureus 26003 and e. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. these mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. among the lactobacilli, l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus grew faster than l. casei in both types of milk samples. all the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. however, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of l. casei. pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. all the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
ti  - competitive exclusion of diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) from human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells by heat-killed lactobacillus.
ab  - diarrheagenic escherichia coli (etec) bearing cfa/i or cfa/ii adhesive factors specifically adhere onto the brush border of the polarized epithelial human intestinal caco-2 cells in culture. heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb, that adheres onto caco-2 cells, inhibits diarrheagenic escherichia coli adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner. since the l. acidophilus does not express etec-cfa adhesive factors, it can be postulated that the heat-killed l. acidophilus lb cells inhibit diarrheagenic e. coli attachment by steric hindrance of the human enterocytic etec receptors.
ti  - heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus inhibits adhesion of escherichia coli b41 to hela cells.
ab  - escherichia coli b41 (o101: k99: f41: st+) adheres to hela 229 cells in a diffuse pattern. heat-killed (100-105 degrees c) lactobacillus acidophilus (lacteol strain) was found to inhibit this adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. this inhibitory action was lost after lysis of the l acidophilus, suggesting steric hindrance of e coli adhesion sites rather than competition for a common binding site. a thermostable factor (100-105 degrees c) excreted by l acidophilus into the medium may be required for the adhesion of l acidophilus to hela cells, and for the inhibition of adhesion of e coli to these cells.
ti  - detection of a lactobacillus substance that inhibits escherichia coli.
ab  - recent studies have shown that certain lactobacilli strains have the ability to interfere with the adherence and growth of uropathogenic bacteria. this interaction is believed to be important in the maintenance of a normal urogenital flora and in the prevention of infection in females. in the present study, lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus acidophilus 76 were found to exert an inhibitory effect on pyelonephritogenic mutant escherichia coli hu 734 and e. coli atcc 25922. the bioactivity of the inhibitor produced by strain gr-1 was retained under ph buffered conditions and was bactericidal. the bioactive substance was heat labile, not precipitated by up to 80% ammonium sulphate, and extractable in chloroform. the data indicated that the inhibitor is not lactic acid or hydrogen peroxide and has a molecular weight greater than 12,000-14,000. human urine supported production of the inhibitor and reduced and delayed outgrowth of the e. coli. the ability of l. casei gr-1 and possibly other lactobacilli strains to produce inhibitors of uropathogenic bacteria may have clinical importance and significance in the microbial ecology of the urogenital tract.
ti  - in vivo inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus against pathogenic escherichia coli in gnotobiotic chicks.
ab  - chicks were hatched germfree in gnotobiotic isolators to determine the inhibitory effects of lactobacillus acidophilus towards pathogeneic escherichia coli in vivo. twelve trials were conducted in two flexible film isolators utilizing a total of 221 chicks. one treatment consisted of inoculating 2-day-old chicks with l. acidophilus, then challenging with pathogenic e. coli with subsequent dosing with l. acidophilus. the other treatment consisted of challenging with the e. coli at 2 days of age, then subsequently dosing with l. acidophilus. statistical analysis of the data showed initial dosing with l. acidophilus prevented excessive mortality when chicks were challenged with e. coli. also, continued dosing with l. acidophilus lowered the ph in the crop, cecum, and rectum whether chicks were initially given l. acidophilus or e. coli. this strain of l. acidophilus was capable of competing with e. coli in the gut of gnotobiotic chicks.
ti  - the formation of germtubes by candida albicans, when grown with staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacilius acidophilus and proteus vulgaris.
ab  - the formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of c. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: staphylococcus pyegene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus acidophilus and proteus vulgaris. all the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by c. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by c. albicans. since germtubes of c. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by c. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.
