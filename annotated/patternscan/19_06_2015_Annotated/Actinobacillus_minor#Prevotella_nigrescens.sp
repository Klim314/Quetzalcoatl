TI  == specific antibiotics in the treatment of periodontitis--a proposed strategy.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present study was to propose a strategy for the selection of antibiotics that specifically target complexes of periodontal pathogens present in patients with periodontitis. methods: seven hundred seventy-four (774) patients with various forms of periodontitis were included in  the study. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest periodontal pockets in each quadrant using a sterile curet, and pooled. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, tannerella  forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were identified by polymerase chain reaction, and the prevalence of combinations of these pathogens  was determined. to each pathogen complex (pc), i.e., combination of pathogens, those antibiotics were assigned that were most specific according to the published minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentrations achievable in vivo. antibiotic gcf concentrations had to be at least 10 times the mic90 values, and the narrowest spectrum was selected with respect to the assessed periodontal pathogens. results: nine major pcs (each > or = 3% of all patients) were found in 73.4% of all patients, whereas 38 minor pcs (each < 3% of all patients) were distributed in 26.6% of all patients. ten different antibiotic regimens were found to be specific for the total of 46 pcs; i.e., metronidazole and amoxicillin in 11 pcs (55.0% of all patients), metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in 13 pcs (18.9%), amoxicillin in 4 pcs (8.3%), doxycycline in 2 pcs (6.1%), metronidazole in 8 pcs (4.1%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 3 pcs (2.9%), clindamycin in 2 pcs (1.5%), ciprofloxacin in 2 pcs (0.4%), and tetracycline in 1 pc (0.3%). conclusion: the results of the study indicate that there are at least 46 different combinations of the assessed periodontal pathogens in subjects with periodontitis, and at least 10 different antibiotic regimens might be required to specifically target the various pathogen complexes.

TI  == periodontitis patient and the spouse: periodontal bacteria before and after treatment.
AB  == suspected periodontal pathogens can be transmitted between spouses. the treatment response may be unsuccessful in periodontitis patients, if the spouse harbors these bacteria. the aim of the present 6-month follow-up study was to clarify whether the microbiological treatment outcome of periodontitis patients is related to the detection of suspected periodontal pathogens in the saliva of the  spouse. 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and their spouses were included in the study. the patients received mechanical periodontal treatment and 500 mg metronidazole systemically 2x a day for 7 days. the presence of visible plaque, gingival bleeding after probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus and pocket depths were assessed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after treatment. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros were cultured from pooled subgingival samples from the  patients and from salivary samples from the spouses at corresponding occasions. periodontal conditions in the patients improved after treatment as determined by  the significantly lower values of clinical variables 1 and 6 months after treatment compared to those at baseline. however, the re-emergence of periodontal bacteria after treatment of the patients was not related to the concurrent detection of the respective bacteria in the saliva of the spouses. in this study  design, it seemed that the salivary bacterial load in the spouse was of minor importance for the microbiological treatment outcome of the patient.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.
