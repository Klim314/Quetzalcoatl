TI  == design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  == twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. all the compounds had mics between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. in order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of  staphylococcus aureus. compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive  s. aureus (mssa) at mics of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa) at mics of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and mdr-mrsa at mic of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. the majority of cells in biofilm populations of mssa and mrsa were eradicated at low level of 3, with mbics in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.

TI  == ophthalmic infections in children presenting to angkor hospital for children, siem reap, cambodia.
AB  == background: ophthalmic infections cause significant morbidity in cambodian children but aetiologic data are scarce. we investigated the causes of acute eye  infections in 54 children presenting to the ophthalmology clinic at angkor hospital for children, siem reap between march and october 2012. findings: the median age at presentation was 3.6 years (range 6 days - 16.0 years). forty two patients (77.8%) were classified as having an external eye infection, ten (18.5%) as ophthalmia neonatorum, and two (3.7%) as intra-ocular infection. organisms were identified in all ophthalmia neonatorum patients and 85.7% of patients with  an external eye infection. pathogens were not detected in either of the intra-ocular infection patients. most commonly isolated bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13), coliforms (7), haemophilus influenzae/parainfluenzae (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (2). chlamydia trachomatis dna was detected in 60% of swabs taken from ophthalmia neonatorum cases. conclusions: this small study demonstrates the wide range of pathogens associated with common  eye infections in cambodian children. the inclusion of molecular assays improved  the spectrum of detectable pathogens, most notably in neonates.

TI  == purulent pericarditis caused by haemophilus parainfluenzae.
AB  == bacterial pericarditis is a rare disease in the era of antibiotics. purulent pericarditis is most often caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, or haemophilus influenzae. the number of h. parainfluenzae infections has been increasing; in rare cases, it has caused endocarditis. we report a case  of purulent pericarditis caused by h. parainfluenzae in a 62-year-old woman who reported a recent upper respiratory tract infection. the patient presented with signs and symptoms of pericardial tamponade. urgent pericardiocentesis restored her hemodynamic stability. however, within 24 hours, fluid reaccumulation led to  recurrent pericardial tamponade and necessitated the creation of a pericardial window. cultures of the first pericardial fluid grew h. parainfluenzae. levofloxacin therapy was started, and the patient recovered. haemophilus parainfluenzae should be considered in a patient who has signs and symptoms of purulent pericarditis. prompt diagnosis, treatment, and antibiotic therapy are necessary for the patient's survival. to our knowledge, this is the first report  of purulent pericarditis caused by h. parainfluenzae.

TI  == septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint: an uncommon location.
AB  == septic pyogenic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is a rare entity that occurs in immunosuppressed patients or those with discontinuity of defense barriers. there are only 15 cases described in the literature. the diagnosis is based on clinical features and the isolation of a microorganism in synovial fluid or blood cultures. the evidence of arthritis by imaging (mri, ultrasound or scintigraphy) may be useful. antibiotic treatment is the same as in septic arthritis in other locations. staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most frequently isolated. our objective was to describe the clinical features, treatment and outcome of patients diagnosed with septic arthritis of the acromioclavicular joint at a rheumatology department. we developed a study with a retrospective design (1989-2012). the medical records of patients with septic arthritis were reviewed (101 patients). those involving the acromioclavicular joint were selected (6 patients; 6%).

TI  == ocular surface infections in northeastern state of malaysia: a 10-year review of  bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == objective: ocular surface infections that include infections of conjunctiva, adnexa, and cornea have the potential risk of causing blindness within a given population. empirical antibiotic therapy is usually initiated based on epidemiological data of common causative agents. thus, the aims of this study were to determine the bacterial agents and their susceptibility patterns of isolates from ocular surface specimens in our hospital. methods: this is a retrospective analysis and records of bacterial isolates from ocular surface specimens in hospital universiti sains malaysia from january 2001 to december 2010 were examined. specimens were processed according to standard laboratory procedures. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted based on clinical  and laboratory standards institute recommendations. only single, nonrepetitive isolates were included in the analysis. results: a total of 1,267 isolates were obtained during the study period, which comprised staphylococcus aureus (n = 299, 23.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 194, 15.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 108, 8.5%), haemophilus influenzae (n = 100, 7.9%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 84, 6.6%), and enterobacter spp. (n = 81, 6.4%). fungi contributed to 4.4% of the total isolates. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that gram-positive bacteria were generally resistant to gentamicin (19%-57%), whereas  gram-negative bacteria were resistant to chloramphenicol (27%-58%). conclusions:  based on the above results, knowledge of the initial gram stain findings is imperative before the commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. therefore, a  simple gram staining for all eye specimens is highly recommended.

TI  == induced sputum compared to bronchoalveolar lavage in young, non-expectorating cystic fibrosis children.
AB  == background: induced sputum (is) is feasible and safe in young cf children and is  a readily accessible, non-invasive technique. however, it has not been compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (bal), the gold standard for diagnosing lower airway infection. methods: we compared bacterial yield from is and bal in 11 non-expectorating cf children, aged 3 to 7.4 years. is samples were obtained in 10/11 cases. results: eight out of ten had the same predominant bacteria cultured from is and bal: pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia[1], staphylococcus aureus[3], and upper respiratory tract flora [4]. in one, serratia marcescens and haemophilus parainfluenzae were cultured from is alone, whereas in one, non-group b haemophilus influenzae was cultured from bal alone. conclusions: as proof of principle, is samples showed good bacteriologic correlation with bal. larger studies are recommended to confirm is as a clinically valuable tool and measure for early intervention studies in young cf children.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the asia-pacific region and south africa (2010).
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and common gram-negative organisms, including wild-type enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti) in the asia-pacific region and south africa. a total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from ssti and 1251 from carti, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 aware ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. ceftaroline was very active against s. aureus (mic50/90, 0.25/1 mug/ml; 93.4% susceptible), including  mrsa (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml; 80.6% susceptible). against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) than penicillin (mic90, 0.06 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also highly active against  viridans group streptococci (mic90, 0.12 mug/ml). similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli (mic50/90, >32/>32 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (mic50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/ml) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an esbl phenotype in the region, particularly in china. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against s. pneumoniae (mic50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/ml; 99.8% susceptible by clinical and laboratory standards institute [clsi] criteria), and it was also highly potent against haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/ml; 100% susceptible by clsi criteria). ceftaroline was also active against h. parainfluenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml). in summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with ssti and carti from the asia-pacific region and south africa.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus and other skin and soft tissue infections among basic military trainees, lackland air force base, texas, 2008-2012.
AB  == military training environments have been identified as high-risk settings for acquisition of skin and soft tissue infections (sstis), including those caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). among the 148,355 basic military trainees at lackland air force base, texas, between 1 october 2008 and 30 september 2012, there were 289 sstis, including 48 cases of culture-confirmed  mrsa and 48 cases of possible mrsa-defined as sstis treated with both incision and drainage and mrsa drug coverage (i.e., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, a tetracycline, or linezolid). the period prevalence rates of all sstis and mrsa sstis increased annually since fiscal year 2010. of the 87 sstis cultured during the surveillance period, 74 were positive: mrsa (n=48); methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (n=24); haemophilus parainfluenzae (n=1); and viridans streptococcus (n=1). among mrsa positive cultures, three were resistant to clindamycin, one to tetracycline, and one to both clindamycin and tetracycline; none was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. an algorithmic clinical approach and heightened public health measures may reduce rates of future sstis among basic trainees at lackland air force base.

TI  == infective endocarditis in children without underlying heart disease.
AB  == background/purpose: although pre-existing heart disease is the main predisposing  factor for pediatric infective endocarditis (ie), cases of ie in children without underlying heart disease have been increasingly reported. this study reviews the  clinical and laboratory characteristics of pediatric ie patients with and without underlying heart disease, and presents the unique features of patients with no apparent pre-existing heart disease. methods: children who were admitted to our hospital from january 1991 to april 2011 and met the modified duke criteria for definite or possible ie were retrospectively analyzed. clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected by chart review. results: forty-seven patients with a total of 48 episodes of ie were enrolled. of these patients, 31 children (64.6%) had congenital heart disease (chd), six (12.5%) had non-chd chronic disease, and eleven (22.9%) were previously healthy adolescents. five patients with non-chd chronic conditions acquired infection from central catheter: two methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), two candida albicans and one  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons). the microbial pathogens in 11 previously healthy individuals were streptococcus viridans (n = 3), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa, n = 2), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 2), staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), enterococcus (n = 1), and diphtheroid (n  = 1). in total, five of 17 non-chd patients were infected with s. aureus (two mrsa and three mssa) and the vegetations in these five patients were detected in  the right side of the heart (tricuspid valve or right atrium). the average interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of ie in the chd and previously  healthy groups was 18 and 31 days, respectively. patients in the previously healthy group were older and more often required surgical interventions for removal of vegetation. conclusion: over one-third (35.4%) of cases of ie in children occurred in patients without pre-existing cardiac disease. early identification of these patients is critical and requires a high index of suspicion. the pathogenesis of ie in previously healthy individuals is still uncertain, but previous skin infection or dental problems may contribute to potential risk.

TI  == surgical site infections after gracilis free flap reconstruction for facial paralysis.
AB  == compared with other free tissue transfer procedures, the gracilis free muscle transfer (gfmt) for facial reanimation is unique in that the recipient site is typically uninvolved by malignancy or infection. in this study, the authors examined the incidence, bacteriology, and outcomes of surgical site infection (ssi) after gracilis free muscle transfer for facial reanimation. from 2003 to 2011, 105 patients underwent 107 gfmt operations, with 6 ssis. all cases of infection occurred in patients receiving clindamycin, levofloxacin, and/or cefazolin perioperatively. none of the patients who received ampicillin-sulbactam developed an ssi. surgical site cultures grew oral flora, including alpha-hemolytic streptococci, haemophilus parainfluenzae, fusobacterium and neisseria species, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. notably, there were no methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections. these data may have implications for the optimal perioperative antibiotic choice in facial reanimation cases. further study is needed to determine the ideal antibiotic regimen for this category of free flap surgeries.

TI  == summary of ceftaroline activity against pathogens in the united states, 2010: report from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance program.
AB  == the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance evaluation (aware) surveillance  program is a sentinel resistance monitoring system designed to track the activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents. in the united states, a total of 8,434 isolates were collected during the 2010 surveillance program from 65 medical centers distributed across the nine census regions (5 to 10 medical centers per region). all organisms were isolated from documented infections, including 3,055  (36.2%) bloodstream infections, 2,282 (27.1%) respiratory tract infections, 1,965 (23.3%) acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, 665 (7.9%) urinary tract infections, and 467 (5.5%) miscellaneous other infection sites. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam agent tested against staphylococci. the mic(90) values were 1 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; 98.4% susceptible) and 0.5 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). ceftaroline was 16- to 32-fold more potent than ceftriaxone against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal strains. all staphylococcus isolates (s. aureus and cons) were inhibited at ceftaroline mic values of </= 2 mug/ml. ceftaroline also displayed potent activity against streptococci (mic(90), 0.015 mug/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci; mic(90), 0.25 mug/ml for penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae). potent activity was also shown against gram-negative pathogens (haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis). furthermore, wild-type strains of enterobacteriaceae (non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producing strains and non-ampc-hyperproducing strains) were often susceptible to ceftaroline. continued monitoring through surveillance networks will allow for the assessment  of the evolution of resistance as this new cephalosporin is used more broadly to  provide clinicians with up-to-date information to assist in antibiotic stewardship and therapeutic decision making.

TI  == [the role of macrolides in treatment of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  == exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) cause a lot of hospital admissions, mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of  life. approximately half of copd exacerbations are associated with bacterial infections and many patients have lower airways colonization. current guidelines  recommend antibotic therapy in course of copd exacerbation for patients with sputum purulence and suggest correlation between severity of symptoms and the type of infecting pathogen. the most common bacterial pathogens isolated in copd  exacerbation are haemophilus influenzae and parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. the presence of these bacteria are more common for mild and moderate exacerbations. more virulent organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found in more severe cases. atypical pathogens such chlamydophila and mycoplasma could cause exacerbation alone or they could coexist with typical pathogen. rules of antibiotic therapy and usefulness of macrolides in treatment of copd exacerbation has been described in the article.

TI  == patterns and dynamics of airway colonisation in mechanically-ventilated patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and dynamics of the microbiota in the airways of ventilated patients. seventy-four mechanically-ventilated patients were recruited consecutively, and oropharyngeal, tracheal and bronchoalveolar (bal) fluid specimens were collected 48 h after intubation, and every 72 h thereafter until the patient was extubated or a total  of five sample sets had been collected. ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) pathogens were identified, quantified and genotyped. microbial findings were highly correlated both between airway locations and over time when samples were taken no more than 72 h apart. if no vap pathogen was present in the oral flora,  it was unlikely to be found in a lower airway sample; i.e., the positive predictive value of the oropharyngeal sample was 0.73 (95% ci 0.67-0.80), and the negative predictive value was 0.95 (95% ci 0.92-0.99). colonisation with enterobacteriacae, non-fermentative bacteria and staphylococcus aureus was monoclonal in the airways and over time, whereas colonisation with microbes normally found in the oropharynx, i.e., haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, was polyclonal. when antibiotics were used, the chance of recovering vap pathogens from all sampling sites was reduced three-fold. no correlation was observed between a bacterial count of > or =10(4) cfu/ml in bal fluid and chest x-rays compatible with vap.

TI  == [a case of pulmonary abscess in which haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus intermedius were isolated by percutaneous needle aspiration].
AB  == some microbes, including the bacteroides species, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus milleri groups, can cause pulmonary abscess. haemophilus parainfluenzae is usually categorized as one of the normal flora which colonizes  in the ears and the nasopharynx, and it has been long considered that h. parainfluenzae has little pathogenicity in the lower respiratory tract and lung parenchymal. in this report, we present a case of pulmonary abscess caused by both h. parainfluenzae and streptococcus intermedius. the patient was a 75-year-old man who had had total esophageo-gastrectomy because of esophageal cancer. he presented with purulent sputum, and chest x-ray film showed a dense consolidation in the right upper lung field. ct-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration was performed as a diagnostic procedure. since both h. parainfluenzae  and s. intermedius had been isolated from the lesion, pulmonary abscess caused by these two pathogens was diagnosed. the patient was treated with panipenem/betamipron, and his symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest x-ray film improved thereafter. so far, very few cases have been reported in which h. parainfluenzae caused lower respiratory tract infection. although s. intermedius is known as one of the pathogens of pulmonary abscess, it is possible that h. parainfluenzae could also be pathogenic in infectious diseases of the lung.

AB  == to investigate the effect of slow-release (sr) clarithromycin on colonization and the development of resistance in oropharyngeal and nasal flora, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed with 8 weeks of follow-up. a total of 296 patients with documented coronary artery disease were randomized in  the preoperative outpatient clinic to receive a daily dose of sr clarithromycin (500 mg) (cl group) or placebo tablets (pb group) until the day of surgery. nose  and throat swabs were taken before the start of therapy, directly after the end of therapy, and 8 weeks later. the presence of potential pathogenic bacteria was  determined, and if they were isolated, mic testing was performed. quantitative culture on media with and without macrolides was performed for the indigenous oropharyngeal flora. in addition, analysis of the mechanism of resistance was performed with the macrolide-resistant indigenous flora. basic patient characteristics were comparable in the two treatment groups. the average number of tablets taken was 15 (standard deviation = 6.4). from the throat swabs, haemophilus parainfluenzae was isolated and carriage was not affected in either of the treatment groups. nasal carriage of staphylococcus aureus, however, was significantly reduced in the cl group (from 35.3 to 4.3%) compared to the pb group (from 32.4 to 30.3%) (p < 0.0001; relative risk [rr], 7.0; 95% confidence interval [ci], 3.1 to 16.0). resistance to clarithromycin was present significantly more frequently in h. parainfluenzae in the cl group after treatment (p = 0.007; rr, 1.6; 95% ci, 1.1 to 2.3); also, the percentage of patients with resistance to macrolides in the indigenous flora after treatment was significantly higher in the cl group (31 to 69%) (p < 0.0001; rr, 1.9; 95% ci, 1.4 to 2.5). this persisted for at least 8 weeks. this study shows that besides the effective elimination of nasal carriage of s. aureus, treatment with  sr clarithromycin for approximately 2 weeks has a marked and sustained effect on  the development of resistance in the oropharyngeal flora for at least 8 weeks.

TI  == microbial etiologies in community acquired pneumonia (cap).
AB  == the objective of the study was determination of bacterial etiologic factors, including antibiotic atypical pathogens, of community acquired pneumonia (cap) in adults and of sensitivity of isolated strains. the examined group comprised 50 patients with clinical and x-ray image of pneumonia. patients' expectoration sputum was analyzed. amongst all isolated bacteria, the most frequent were staphylococcus aureus - 17.9%, haemophilus parainfluenzae - 12.5% and h. influenzae - 8.9%. identification of corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum in 8.9% of cap cases drew our particular attention. staphylococcus aureus was the least antibiotic sensitive microorganism. in the majority of patients (26: 52%), serologic markers of chlamydial infection were determined. pneumonia often results from mixed typical and atypical flora infection. high percentage of atypical pathogens in the examined material suggests the necessity to administer  intracellularly acting antibiotics.

TI  == amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (er) tablets (augmentin xr, glaxosmithkline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. the bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. in clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap), amoxicillin/clavulanate er was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be  generally well tolerated. amoxicillin/clavulanate er is approved in the us for the treatment of patients with abs or cap caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus) and s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == this study compared the in vitro activity of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against 381 aerobic and facultative bacterial pathogens isolated from 320 patients with acute bacterial exacerbation  of chronic bronchitis or community-acquired pneumonia. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae accounted for 54.6% of the isolates. the ertapenem mic was < or =2 mg/l for 98.4% of isolates and > or =8 mg/l for 1.0% (all methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem had the most potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, moraxella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and its activity against h. influenzae and h.  parainfluenzae, all strains of which were susceptible, was not altered by beta-lactamase production. only one s. pneumoniae strain, a penicillin-resistant  isolate, was resistant to ertapenem. ertapenem was highly active in vitro against pyogenic bacteria recovered from patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == oral bacteria influenced by the functional status of the elderly people and the type and quality of facilities for the bedridden.
AB  == aims: to analyse the relationship between oral bacteria and the health and functional status of the elderly. methods and results: the bacteria species in the oral cavity of the elderly were examined. it was found that the bedridden subjects staying at two hospitals for long-term (hobr) showed significantly lower detection rates of commensal bacteria species and significantly higher detection  rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and of coagulase(-) staph. aureus than those living independently (the independent). in addition, the detection rate of haemophilus parainfluenzae in nubr was discovered to be higher than that found in the independent. in hobr, the detection rate of ps. aeruginosa was significantly higher among in-patients who required continual care than those in need of partial care, while the detection rate of mrsa was significantly higher among in-patients with low serum albumin than those with normal serum albumin. conclusions: oral bacteria examination analysis proved that the risks of infection of some pathogenic bacteria species were correlated with functional status, physical function and nutritional state.  significance and impact of the study: our study suggests that the oral bacteria,  especially pathogenic bacteria were influenced by the functional status of the elderly and the type and quality of the facilities for the bedridden, physical function and nutritional state.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == the efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == an international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. clinical success rates were  maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). the 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating cap. at follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. the most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), haemophilus influenzae (19%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), moraxella catarrhalis (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and  staphylococcus aureus (4%). the bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. the adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. in all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of cap. bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater  than those of clarithromycin. moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

TI  == respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  == although most respiratory tract infections (rti) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with rti must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of s. pneumoniae from france and spain. uniquely, in italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. in 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 european countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. the mic(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of s. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/l, the mics for only five strains being >2  mg/l, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/l. the mic(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of h. influenzae and  323 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of m. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/l. the mic(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of legionella pneumophila (mic(90) 0.015 mg/l), mycoplasma pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and chlamydia pneumoniae (mics 0.06-0.12 mg/l). current susceptibility data indicate  that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in european countries. the enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of s. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of rti.

AB  == although controversial, antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) appears beneficial in patients with a  history of repeated infections, those who have comorbid illnesses, and those with marked airway obstruction. in a community-based, open, randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin (cip) 750 mg and clarithromycin (cla) 500 mg, each given twice daily for 10 days, were compared in 2180 patients with aecb  (1083 cip, 1097 cla). patients were >40 years of age and had complicated/severe aecb episodes defined as at least three episodes within the past year, at least three comorbid conditions, previous failed antibiotic treatment for aecb within the previous 2 to 4 weeks, or community susceptibility data indicating a high number of resistant pathogens. significant bacterial isolates (>10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter) from homogenized sputa were identified. susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials was determined by the microbroth dilution technique. the majority of patients were white (83%) and were current or previous smokers (81%). mean patient age was 62 years. a history of at least three aecb episodes in the previous year was reported by 54% of cip-treated patients and 53% of cla-treated patients. of 777 primary isolates positively identified and cultured from 673 patients, the bacterial pathogens isolated and their incidence included haemophilus species, 28%; moraxella catarrhalis, 18%; enterobacteriaceae, 18%; staphylococcus aureus, 17%; streptococcus pneumoniae, 7%; and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4%. beta-lactamase production was found in 38% of haemophilus influenzae, 10% of haemophilus parainfluenzae, and 85% of m catarrhalis isolates. thirty-four percent of s pneumoniae isolates were resistant to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration > or =0.12 mg/l). among the 673 patients who were valid for clinical assessment and had a pretherapy pathogen isolated, clinical success and overall bacteriologic eradication rates at the end of therapy were 93% and 98% for cip versus 90% and 96% for cla. the differences between cip and cla did not reach statistical significance. superinfections were  reported significantly more frequently in cla-treated (3%) versus cip-treated patients (1%). eradication rates for specific organisms for cip and cla, respectively, were haemophilus species, 99% and 93%; m catarrhalis, 99% and 100%; s pneumoniae, 91% and 92%; and enterobacteriaceae, 100% and 95%. drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of cip-treated patients and 10% of cla-treated patients. cip 750 mg b.i.d. had a higher (but not statistically significant) clinical and bacteriologic cure rate than cla 500 mg b.i.d. in the treatment of patients with bacteriologically proven complicated/severe aecb. the causative bacterial pathogens of aecb appear to be evolving, with a predominance of gram-negative and other resistant organisms observed. thus antibiotic therapy for at-risk patients with aecb should include agents that have activity against gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == cefaclor: a contemporary look at susceptibility of key pathogens from around the  globe.
AB  == the orally administered cephalosporin antibiotic, cefaclor, has been available for clinical use in many countries since 1979. because widespread antibiotic use  is often cited as a factor in the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, we sought to determine the degrees of resistance to cefaclor expressed by key pathogens recently isolated in 10 countries widely distributed around the world. using the e-test, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were  determined for cefaclor and several comparator antibiotics against approximately  700 fresh clinical isolates of each of six bacterial species. the results demonstrated that > 90% of haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase producing and non-producing), moraxella catarrhalis (> 90% beta-lactamase producing), and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and 85% of escherichia coli were susceptible to cefaclor at the nccls interpretive breakpoints. mic distributions  showed that there has been no change in the activity of cefaclor against penicillin-susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae since 1977.

TI  == in-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  == one hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. all isolates, except rothia spp. (one), enterococcus avium (three), haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of prevotella, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides and porphyromonas. all the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. a potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the mics of  spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of eubacterium, two of  lactobacilli, one strain of peptostreptococcus sp. and one clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.

TI  == [balanitis and infectious agents. a prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the st. louis hospital in paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. methods: one hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. all underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. results: candida albicans (ca) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. a pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus milleri, group hb5) was found without ca in  28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group d streptococci)  was found without ca in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. discussion: this series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with  and without balanitis (p < 0.9). the role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? the significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. the clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of  any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.

TI  == [potential pathogenic throat bacterial flora in acute successive pharyngitis and  tonsillitis in children].
AB  == the purpose of this work was to determine the frequency of occurrence of s. aureus, h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterobacteriaceae spp. and nonfermenting rods in a group of children suffering from acute successive pharyngitis and tonsillitis. specimens were taken during three acute occurrences and twice after treatment from first and second acute occurrences. s. aureus was isolated from the throats of 55.1%-62% of the sick children. h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae were isolated from about 22% to over 40% of the sick children, beta-haemolytic streptococci were isolated from 10.3%-16.2% of the sick children and enterobacteriaceae spp. were isolated from the throats of 6.1%-16.25% of the sick children. nonfermenting rods were isolated from only one sick child. two or more possible bacterial pathogens were isolated  from several sick children. among them s. aureus with h. influenzae or with h. parainfluenzae or with beta-haemolytic streptococci were most often isolated. after treatment of these children, s. aureus, h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae were more rarely isolated from the throat, and beta-haemolytic streptococci or enterobacteriaceae spp. were isolated occasionally. similarly, after treatment mixed potentially pathogenic bacterial flora were more rarely seen.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility tests with fastidious and nonfastidious bacterial reference strains: effects of aerobic versus hypercapnic incubation.
AB  == representative antimicrobial drugs were examined under aerobic and hypercapnic (3 and 5% v/v co2) incubation with the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion, a broth microdilution method, and the agar dilution procedure against nonfastidious, standard atcc quality control strains and against two beta-hemolytic streptococcal, two pneumococcal, and three haemophilus influenzae atcc strains. it was found that an atmosphere of 3-5% co2 merely antagonized amikacin, gentamicin, and netilmicin; the activity of penicillin g was antagonized only against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 in broth media, but not against any of the other strains. the activity of teicoplanin, and less so that of vancomycin, was enhanced only against s. aureus strain atcc 25923, but not against the other  strains. it was concluded that susceptibility tests, excluding aminoglycoside antibiotics, of beta-hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, and h. influenzae and h. parainfluenzae should be incubated under 3% (candle jar or incubator) or 5% co2 (incubator) so as to ensure optimal growth of capnephilic strains and thus avoid potentially misleading large inhibition zones of deceptively low minimal inhibitory concentrations.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == changes in the spectrum of organisms causing respiratory tract infections: a review.
AB  == over the last decade, the spectrum of organisms causing community-acquired acute  lower respiratory tract infections has changed. streptococcus pneumoniae now causes approximately 30% of outpatient acute pneumonia-less than in former decades-whereas mycoplasma pneumoniae is found in both young and elderly patients. the enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus are now seen more frequently as respiratory tract pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia patients, and they are the major organisms causing pneumonia in residents of homes for the elderly or nursing homes, and in immuno-compromised patients. agents that were previously considered non-pathogenic for the respiratory tract include serotypes of haemophilus influenzae other than type b, h. parainfluenzae  and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis; these organisms affect mainly patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease. legionella species can cause sporadic as well as epidemic disease of the lower respiratory tract. chlamydia pneumoniae is  a newly recognized pathogen responsible for mild to severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections. in 60-80% of cases, hospital-acquired pneumonias are caused by gram-negative bacilli and s. aureus. these organisms colonize the mucosal membranes of the upper respiratory tract and penetrate into the lower tract by aspiration or intubation.

TI  == [the role of bacteria on facial rosacea-like dermatitis in adult type atopic dermatitis].
AB  == to investigate the role of bacteria on facial rosacea-like dermatitis lesion in adult type atopic dermatitis, we measured the numbers of bacteria on the skin, nasal and pharyngeal surface of each individual, and then examined its sensitivity to antibiotics. the numbers of bacteria on the surface of skin increased according to the severity of skin eruption. staphylococcus aureus was detected from the skin and nasal surface more than pharyngeal surface. bacteria on the pharyngeal surface were both staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae. therefore, it is suggested that bacterial flora on the pharynx is different from those of the skin and nose. the treatment with antibiotics was effective for exudative lesions, whereas lichenified lesion did not respond to antibiotic therapy. these results suggest that bacteria on the skin surface are one of precipitating factors of the rosacea-like dermatitis of atopic dermatitis.

TI  == [arterial embolism of the limbs in infectious endocarditis of the heart valves].
AB  == nine cases of infective endocarditis (ie) on native valves, complicated by arterial embolism of the limbs (ael), were collected between june 1974 and october 1988 (prevalence 4.3 percent). among the 11 ael recorded, 9 involved the  lower limbs and 2 the upper limbs. the diagnosis, suspected in patients with acute ischaemia (n = 6), transient (n = 1) or pseudophlebitic (n = 1) pain, or discovered by systematic pulse examination (n = 3), was confirmed by doppler ultrasound (n = 3), angiography (n = 2) or oscillometry (n = 4). ael occurred 2.8 weeks on average after the onset of treatment; it appeared 6 months after the end of treatment in 1 case and preceded the diagnosis of ie by 1 to 6 weeks in 3 cases. the causative organisms isolated in 7 cases were: non-haemolytic streptococci (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 1) and enterococcus (n = 1). vegetations were found in 6 of the 7 patients explored by echocardiography. two cases of embolism of the femoral artery required embolectomy. effective heparin anticoagulation was obtained in only one  patient. six patients underwent valve replacement in the acute phase of endocarditis. after a mean follow-up period of 32 months (range 3 to 120 months), only one patient has symptoms (claudication of the left upper limb); 5 patients are asymptomatic with a reduced (n = 5) or abolished (n = 2) pulse. three embolisms have left no sequelae. altogether, ael are not uncommon in infective endocarditis. they rarely influence the functional prognosis and are detected by  systematic palpation of the pulses. anticoagulation in effective doses is discussed. attempts at removing the obstruction should be made only in cases with poorly tolerated proximal embolism. in patients with multiple or recurrent embolic accidents, valve replacement may be considered.

TI  == effect of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid on the aerobic and anaerobic tonsillar microflora in the treatment of recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == 30 patients with recurrent tonsillitis were treated with amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (500 mg/125 mg) t.i.d. for 10 days. the most often isolated potential aerobic pathogenic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus milleri and haemophilus parainfluenzae. group a streptococci were isolated from 7 patients. anaerobic cocci and bacteroides species were the dominating anaerobic bacteria isolated from the tonsils. tonsillar cultures were taken before antibiotic treatment started, on days 11-12, day 30, and day 90. beta-lactamase producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 13 patients prior to treatment, on days 11-12 in 18 patients, on day 30 in 15 patients, and on day 90 in 13 patients. group a streptococci were eradicated in 6/7 patients. in the aerobic tonsillar microflora, the numbers of viridans streptococci decreased during treatment but were normalized after 30 days. only minor changes in the numbers of other aerobic microorganisms occurred during the investigation. the effect on the anaerobic microflora was minor and no new colonizing microorganisms were isolated during or after antibiotic treatment. all patients except one were cured on days  11-12. five patients had another episode of tonsillitis during the observation period of 3 months. the antibiotic treatment was well tolerated in most patients  and mild adverse events such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in 3 patients.

TI  == pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  zimbabwe, central africa.
AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

TI  == [clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == during 8 months from october 1986 to may 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them  (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6  with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis,  1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-streptococcus, 1 gram-positive cocci, 5 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, 7 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 branhamella catarrhalis, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1  salmonella subgenus i). bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. no  superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of got in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of  gpt in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. as an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, pivka ii was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. from the above results,  it appears that sbt/abpc is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.

TI  == occult polymicrobial endocarditis with haemophilus parainfluenzae in intravenous  drug abusers.
AB  == purpose and patients and methods: fewer than 8 percent of intravenous drug abusers are found to have polymicrobial endocarditis. we report on cases of occult polymicrobial infective endocarditis with haemophilus parainfluenzae in 10 intravenous drug abusers. clinical and laboratory data on all 10 patients were obtained from hospital charts, and information on illicit drug use methods was given by five patients. blood cultures were performed, as well as susceptibility  testing to antibiotics. subsequent molecular epidemiologic studies were performed on selected staphylococcus aureus and h. parainfluenzae strains. phage typing of  s. aureus and biotyping of h. parainfluenzae strains were also done. results: results of the initial blood cultures were positive on the second to fifth days (mean, 2.6 days), demonstrating a gram-positive pathogen in nine patients and bacteroides asaccharolyticus in one. significantly, in each case, h. parainfluenzae alone was subsequently identified from additional blood cultures,  with a mean delay of 20.4 days (range, five to 57 days) to the isolation of this  organism. epidemiologic data indicated that our cases did not represent a point-source outbreak. antibiotic therapy uniformly failed until an agent active  against h. parainfluenzae was added. the constellation of clinical, microbiologic, and epidemiologic findings was similar, and permitted prospective  diagnosis and therapy in three patients. despite the absence of s. aureus bacteremia in four, all 10 patients had right-sided endocarditis with septic pulmonary emboli. five patients had initial blood cultures that were positive for two facultative gram-positive cocci (s. aureus and commensal oral streptococcal species). conclusion: our findings suggest that polymicrobial endocarditis with h. parainfluenzae in intravenous drug abusers is a distinct clinical syndrome, and should be considered in all patients if the response to appropriate antibiotics is atypical or if pulmonary emboli continue with therapy.

TI  == [clinical study of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, in children].
AB  == 1. clarithromycin (te-031, a-56268) was given orally to 46 children with respiratory infections, skin infections and others. a total of 9 patients were excluded; 8 patients refused to take the drug because of it's taste, and 1 patient was later found to have viral pneumonia. clinical efficacy was therefore  evaluated in remaining 37 cases and was good or excellent in 27 cases. 2. bacteriologically, haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from 4 patients were eradicated in 1 and decreased in 3, respectively. haemophilus parainfluenzae and  staphylococcus aureus isolated from 1 patient each were both eradicated. 3. side  effect or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 4. based on the above findings, it appears that te-031 is a safe and is useful antibiotic for the treatment of mild and moderate respiratory infections. it is necessary, however,  to improve the taste of the current granule preparation in order to make the drug more easily palatable to children.

TI  == in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu  per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and  branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd  117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to  date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.

AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. a significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteroides species and fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. one beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase-production in haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae or branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli strain. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice  in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group a streptococci when previous treatment has failed.

AB  == a total of 432 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (128), coagulase-negative staphylococci (123), group a and b beta-hemolytic streptococci (61), group d streptococci (30), streptococcus penumoniae (29), haemophilus influenzae (19), haemophilus parainfluenzae (12), and legionella pneumophila (30) were examined with the agar dilution and bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion tests for susceptibility to josamycin as compared with erythromycin. on a weight-for-weight basis, erythromycin was more active than josamycin against all  bacterial species, including l. pneumophila. josamycin inhibited 18 of 23 s. aureus and 11 of 16 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains resistant to erythromycin. utilizing minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) breakpoints of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml (sensitive), 4 microgram/ml (intermediate)  and of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml (resistant), and inhibition zone  criteria of greater than or equal to 18 mm diameter (sensitive), 14-17 mm (intermediate), and less than or equal to 13 mm (resistant), and excluding l. pneumophila, there was good correlation between erythromycin mic and corresponding disk diffusion data for staphylococci and streptococci, but not for haemophilus species. in comparison, josamycin yielded a significant number of minor discrepant data for group d streptococci and haemophilus species. it is suggested that erythromycin and josamycin should not be tested against haemophilus species, and that josamycin should be excluded from test batteries against enterococci. erythromycin-resistant staphylococci require separate testing with josamycin.

AB  == twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). organisms isolated from infectious foci were staphylococcus aureus (9), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), streptococcus pyogenes (3), escherichia coli (2); and haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable h. influenzae, group b streptococcus, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). microbiologic  cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt  resolution. seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. bacteriologic and clinical cure rates  of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.

TI  == treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  == one hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): neisseria meningitidis in 42, streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, haemophilus influenzae in 16, salmonella spp. in 7, staphylococcus aureus in 2, enterobacter  spp. in 2 and haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. all isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with mic's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. one hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an  aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. one hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. three patients had sequelae. most (88.5%) had sterile csf within 72 h after starting treatment. eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. the only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. the study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.

TI  == the use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  == despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus aprophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, listeria monocytogenes. oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating s. aureus endocarditis. carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. the cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. there have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. they have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid penicillinase paper strip test for detection of beta-lactamase.
AB  == the penicillin-starch paper strip method was compared with the acidometric and iodometric methods for assaying beta-lactamase production, using fresh isolates of clinically important bacteria. results obtained by the three methods were compared for rapidity, accuracy, and stability of reagents. of the 210 isolates tested by the paper strip method, 301 isolates tested by the acidometric method,  and 117 isolates tested by the iodometric method, all were in perfect agreement with the disk diffusion susceptibility test except one strain each of haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the h. influenzae isolate was penicillin resistant and failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase in all three tests. the staphylococci (intermediate and resistant in susceptibility, respectively) failed to give a positive test for beta-lactamase with the iodometric method. the results of the paper strip method, in which 3,241 strains representing nine species of bacteria were used, correlated completely with disk susceptibility tests except for 2 and 69 strains, respectively, of penicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-negative h. influenzae and  h. parainfluenzae. the results of this study indicate that the paper strip method is accurate, simple to perform, extremely economical, and uses materials that are stable when stored frozen. it is eminently suitable for routine laboratory use.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of normal maxillary sinuses.
AB  == the bacterial flora of non-inflamed maxillary sinuses were studied in 12 adults.  patients' median age was 35 years (range 25 to 53 years): 8 were females and 4 were males. aseptic aspiration of the sinus was made when the patients were under general anaesthesia for corrective plastic surgery of the nasal septum. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes. anaerobes were isolated in all 12 specimen patients; in 5 patients (42%), they were the only organisms isolated, and in 7 (58%), they were recovered mixed with aerobes. there were 33 anaerobic isolates (2.75 pr specimen) and the predominant ones were: 11 bacteroides sp. (including 6 b. melaninogenicus), 10 anaerobic gram-positive cocci and 5 fusobacterium sp. there were 16 aerobic isolates (1.3 per specimen) and the predominant ones were: 5 beta hemolytic streptococci, 3 alpha hemolytic streptococci, and 2 each of s. pneumoniae and hemophilus parainfluenzae. beta lactamase production was noted in 4 isolates recovered from 3 patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus (2) and 2 of 6 isolates of b. melaninogenicus. the presence of aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the non-inflamed sinus demonstrates the non-sterility of the sinus cavity. in the events that follow closure of the sinus ostium, these bacteria may become pathogenic.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

TI  == [gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

TI  == metabolism of phosphatidylglycerol, lysylphosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus accumulated cardiolipin (cl) and lost phosphatidylglycerol  (pg) during the stationary phase of growth. the minor lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglucose, also accumulated, whereas the lysylphosphatidylglycerol (lpg) content of the membrane remained constant as stationary phase continued. during exponential growth, the proportions and total  content of phospholipids per cell remained constant. the metabolism of the phospholipids was examined under these conditions. in pulse-chase experiments, the phospholipids lost (14)c from the glycerols slower than (32)p. when the phospholipids were labeled with (14)c glycerol, the unacylated glycerols of pg and lpg lost (14)c, whereas the diacylated glycerols either accumulated or did not lose (14)c. in all experiments, the pg showed a more rapid metabolism than the lpg. when staphylococcal cl was hydrolyzed by haemophilus parainfluenzae cl-specific phospholipase d into phosphatidic acid (pa) and pg, the incorporation of (32)p into both of the phosphates of cl was found to be parallel at both the pg and pa ends of the molecule. however, the specific activity of the (32)p at the pa end was twice that at the pg end of the molecule. the pg end of the cl apparently came from a portion of the cellular pg pool with about 20% the specific activity of the total cellular pg. the turnover of two of the glycerols  of the pg portion of cl was like that of the cellular pg. the diacylated glycerol of the pg and of cl and of the membrane pg showed neither turnover nor incorporation of (14)c. half of the radioactivity was lost from the middle glycerol of cl and the free glycerol of the cellular pg in one bacterial doubling. the diacylated glycerol from the other end of the cl molecule (the pa end) lost radioactivity almost as rapidly as the middle glycerol for 10 min. after the initial rapid loss, the turnover slowed to a rate 10 times slower than  the middle glycerol, indicating that the (14)c was actually accumulating at this  end of the molecule. the phosphates and glycerols involved in the hydrolysis and  resynthesis of the cl molecule during exponential growth in s. aureus apparently  come from different pools of pg.
