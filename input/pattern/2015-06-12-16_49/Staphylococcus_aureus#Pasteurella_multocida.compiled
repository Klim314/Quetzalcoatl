TI  - Conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. Our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. RESULTS: Samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. All samples showed bacterial growth. Thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. Detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. Most frequently isolated bacterial species were Bacillus spp. (13 isolates), Staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), Staphylococcus sciuri and Aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), Ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). Only one isolate of Kocuria varians/rosea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lentus, Morganella morganii, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. The presence in 8 animals of Mycoplasma spp. and in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of Chlamydia spp. was detected by PCR. Candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. CONCLUSIONS: A clear predominance of Gram positive isolates in tortoises and Gram negative isolates in turtles was found. However, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. Almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. That chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard to Salmonella spp. Therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. Worthy of note is the finding of Chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.
TI  - Emerging issues in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from food-producing animals.
AB  - ABSTRACT During the last decade, antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals has become a major research topic. In this review, different emerging resistance properties related to bacteria of food-producing animals are highlighted. These include: extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae; carbapenemase-producing bacteria; bovine respiratory tract pathogens, such as Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica, which harbor the multiresistance mediating integrative and conjugative element ICEPmu1; Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that carry the multiresistance gene cfr; and the occurrence of numerous novel antimicrobial resistance genes in livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The emergence of the aforementioned resistance properties is mainly based on the exchange of mobile genetic elements that carry the respective resistance genes.
TI  - Potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  - A new strain of Bacillus coagulans CGMCC 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli O8, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, Streptococcus suis, Listeria monocytogenes and Pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. In adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of B. subtilis JT143 and L. acidophilus LY24 respectively isolated from BioPlus((R))2B and FloraFIT((R)) Probiotics (P < 0.05). The adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2, 48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. The survival rate of B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. The strain was fully resistant to pH 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. Additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. The safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in B. coagulans CGMCC 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. These results implied that that the new strain of B. coagulans CGMCC 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.
TI  - Screening of Lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. A study was conducted to evaluate probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or cloacae of domestic geese. Among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S-23S regions of rDNA, dominated Lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by Lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and Lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). All lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and Riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. In the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to Lactobacillus was observed in R. anatipestifer and P. multocida, and the lowest in E. coli and S. aureus. The ability to produce H(2)O(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus sp. All lactobacilli showed resistance to pH 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. The antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. The selected Lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria, and were also resistant to low pH and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - New derivatives of salicylamides: Preparation and antimicrobial activity against  various bacterial species.
AB  - Three series of salicylanilides, esters of N-phenylsalicylamides and 2-hydroxy-N-[1-(2-hydroxyphenylamino)-1-oxoalkan-2-yl]benzamides, in total thirty target compounds were synthesized and characterized. The compounds were evaluated against seven bacterial and three mycobacterial strains. The antimicrobial activities of some compounds were comparable or higher than the standards ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or isoniazid. Derivatives 3f demonstrated high biological activity against Staphylococcus aureus (0.03mumol/L), Mycobacterium marinum (0.40mumol/L) and Mycobacterium kansasii (1.58mumol/L), 3g shows activity against Clostridium perfringens (0.03mumol/L) and Bacillus cereus (0.09mumol/L), 3h against Pasteurella multocida (0.03mumol/L) and M. kansasii (0.43mumol/L), 3i against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and B. cereus (0.03mumol/L). The structure-activity relationships are discussed for all the compounds.
TI  - Development and application of a multiplex PCR assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  - Infections with Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. It can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. Thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single tube reaction. The target genes used were KMT1 of P. multocida, the invasion protein gene of S. enterica, 16S rDNA of R. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of E. coli. The detection limit of the assay for all bacterial DNA was 10 pg. The mPCR did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. We applied mPCR to field samples, and the results were the same as the single PCR results. These results suggest that mPCR for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.
TI  - Pneumonia in slaughtered sheep in south-western Iran: pathological characteristics and aerobic bacterial aetiology.
AB  - In this study, the lungs of 1,000 sheep carcasses were subjected to gross examination and those suspected to be infected with pneumonia were studied at histopathological level as well as examined for presence of bacteria. Pneumonia was detected in 42 (4.2%) carcasses. Based on histopathological lesions, 45.24% were affected with suppurative bronchopneumonia, 20.93% with interstitial pneumonia, 11.9% bronchointerstitial pneumonia, 7.14% with fibrinous bronchopneumonia and 2.38% with embolic pneumonia. In addition, 11.9% of the lungs showed lung abscesses and 2.33% were affected with pleuritis without involving pulmonary parenchyma. Bacteriological examination revealed presence of ovine pathogens, such as Pasteurella multocida (24.53%), Staphylococcus aureus (20.75%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.09%), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (7.55%) and Actinomyces pyogenes (1.89%). The most common form of pneumonia was suppurative bronchopneumonia with moderate amounts of fibrin deposits on the pleural surface and inside the bronchioles and alveoli.
TI  - Ceftaroline versus isolates from animal bite wounds: comparative in vitro activities against 243 isolates, including 156 Pasteurella species isolates.
AB  - More than 5 million Americans are bitten by animals, usually dogs, annually. Bite patients comprise approximately 1% of all patients who visit emergency departments (300,000/year), and approximately 10,000 require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. Ceftaroline is the bioactive component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, which is FDA approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs), including those containing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There are no in vitro data about the activity of ceftaroline against Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida and Pasteurella multocida subsp. septica, other Pasteurella spp., or other bite wound isolates. We therefore studied the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against 243 animal bite isolates. MICs were determined using the broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines. Comparator drugs included cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ertapenem, ampicillin-sulbactam, azithromycin, doxycycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP). Ceftaroline was the most active agent against all 5 Pasteurella species, including P. multocida subsp. multocida and P. multocida subsp. septica, with a maximum MIC of </=0.008 mug/ml; more active than ceftriaxone and ertapenem (MIC(90)s, </=0.015 mug/ml); and more active than cefazolin (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) doxycycline (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml), azithromycin (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml), ampicillin-sulbactam (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml), and SMX-TMP (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml). Ceftaroline was also very active against all S. aureus isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) and other Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, with a maximum MIC of 0.125 mug/ml against all bite isolates tested. Ceftaroline has potential clinical utility against infections involving P. multocida, other Pasteurella species, and aerobic Gram-positive isolates, including S. aureus.
TI  - Susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  - In this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin, which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. Most of the bacteria tested (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin MIC(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. Solely Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher MIC(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. Only six (3.4%) of 177 S. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 E. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin MICs of >/= 2 mug/ml. Analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in GyrA that resulted in amino acid exchanges S83L+D87N or S83L+D87Y and single or double mutations in ParC that resulted in amino acid exchanges S80I or S80I+E84G in all 12 E. coli isolates. The six S. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino acid exchanges S84L or E88K in GyrA and S80I in GrlA. Comparative analysis of the MICs of pradofloxacin and the MICs determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens S. pseudintermedius, E. coli and P. multocida. This comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin MICs were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.
TI  - An atypical presentation of a Pasteurella multocida infection following a cat bite: a case report.
AB  - Pasteurella multocida is a bacterial organism that commonly causes cellulitis after animal bites, especially cat bites. We report an unusual vesiculopustular infection of the hand following a domestic cat bite. Pasteurella multocida and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured from the wound and the patient was treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium. Further history revealed that the patient's cat had nibbled on her hand. Pasteurella usually is resistant to many of the typical empiric antibiotics used to treat skin infections. Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium (500 mg 3 times daily) is the treatment of choice for patients who have an infected cat or dog bite with no known bacterial cause. A thorough patient history is needed to promptly arrive at a proper diagnosis for an atypical presentation of a common disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - [Isolation, identification and bioactivity characterization of goose avian beta-defensin 3].
AB  - The objective of the study was to clone avian beta-defensin (AvBD) 3 gene from goose tissues, express the recombinant AvBD3 protein in Escherichia coli, and determine its antimicrobial activity. The mRNA of goose AvBD3 was cloned from spleen and bursa of Fabricius of the gooses by RT-PCR. The sequence analysis showed that the genefragment of AvBD3 contained 182 bp, and encoded 60 amino acids. Homology analysis showed that goose AvBD3 shared the highest percentage of amino acid homology (100%) with chicken AvBD3. The cDNA of goose AvBD3 was sub-cloned into BamH I and Sal I sites of pGEX-6p-1 vector to construct recombinant plasmid pGEX-goose AvBD3. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 and the bacteria was induced with IPTG It was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE that a 31 kDa protein which was equal to goose AvBD3 protein in molecular weight was highly expressed. The purified recombinant goose AvBD3 exhibited extensive antimicrobial activity against twelve bacteria strains, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative investigated. At high salt ions conditions, antimicrobial activity of recombinant goose AvBD3 protein against both Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida decreased significantly. In addition, hemolysis activity of the recombinant protein was extremely low, and the recombinant protein remained antimicrobial activity under different pH values.
TI  - Functional analysis and induction of four novel goose (Anser cygnoides) avian beta-defensins in response to salmonella enteritidis infection.
AB  - In the current study, four novel avian beta-defensins (AvBDs) (AvBD2, 5, 9, and 10) were identified in tissues from the Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides). The antibacterial activity of the AvBDs showed that all of these AvBDs exhibited antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria investigated (P<0.01). In addition, antibacterial activity of all of the AvBDs against Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida decreased significantly or was completely abolished at 150mM NaCl (P<0.01). None of the AvBDs showed hemolytic activity. AvBD2 and AvBD10 were expressed widely, whereas AvBD5 and AvBD9 mRNAs were expressed in a limited number of geese tissues. AvBD9 was significantly induced in some immune tissues from geese after Salmonella enteritidis infection. The others were significantly upregulated in small intestine and some immune tissues of the geese (P<0.01). The present results suggest that the AvBDs are part of the host defense mechanism of the goose.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  - Pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella species. A subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. For 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin MBC was within two doubling dilutions of the MIC. For the remaining strains, the MIC and MBC were within three to four doubling dilutions. Pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the MBC was equal to the MIC for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. As pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/mL. The bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as low as 0.125 mug/mL. In conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of MBC and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. It is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. These data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.
TI  - Psoas abscess due to Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Psoas abscess is a pus collection within the muscle compartment. It is a very uncommon entity. It can be primary as a result of haematogenous spread or secondary as a consequence of a direct extension of an infectious focus. Diagnosis is usually delayed because nonspecific clinical presentation. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism cultured in this type of abscess. We describe a secondary psoas abscess in an elderly female patient. The patient presented with fever, right groin pain and malaise. Following laboratory, radiological and microbiological analyses the patient was diagnosed as having a psoas abscess due to Pasteurella multocida, which is a Gram negative bacteria, part of the normal oral flora of many animals and can causes human infections after animal scratches or bites. More rarely is to find this organism causing psoas abscesses. Because of insidious clinical presentation, the diagnosis of psoas abscess is a challenge and a high index of suspicion is required. We emphasize the importance of bacteriological confirmation of microorganism involved to choose the correct antibiotics. Percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice. Open surgical drainage should be reserved if percutaneous drainage fails.
TI  - Survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in Europe.
AB  - A monitoring programme conducted in Europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cases between 2002 and 2008. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. For respiratory pathogens, Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (MIC</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of M haemolytica strains were resistant (MIC>/=4 microg/ml). Histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). Mycoplasma bovis MIC (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. For mastitis pathogens, the majority of Escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568 and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with MIC centred on 0.25 microg/ml. Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with MIC centred on 1 microg/ml. Marbofloxacin MIC for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published MIC results.
TI  - Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -12 in porcine lung infections.
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a variety of roles during organogenesis, in the immune response and during acute and chronic diseases as well as in tissue remodelling. During the last decade, the pig has become used increasingly as a model for human diseases; however, studies on the expression of porcine MMPs are limited. In the present study species-specific antibodies were produced to investigate the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-12 immunohistochemically in lungs from pigs infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida and Staphylococcus aureus. The immunolabelling of lung tissues (one infected and one control pig representing each infection) was evaluated for cellular distribution and intensity, which was scored semiquantitatively. When compared with healthy, non-infected controls, the expression of both MMP-9 and MMP-12 was higher in infected lungs. The highest expressions were seen in the alveolar epithelium (MMP-9) and alveolar macrophages (MMP-12). These results are in accordance with studies of human lungs.
TI  - Microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  - The primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. Additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both swine and humans. A total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. Of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. Laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSV) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). The most commonly isolated bacteria included: Streptococcus suis (53.7%), Arcanobacterium pyogenes (29.9%), Pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and Streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). Virus screening revealed evidence of PRRSV and PCV-2 in 22.0% and 11.9% of the samples, respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. Tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for Staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (OR) = 7.51, confidence interval (CI) = 2.89 to 19.54], Streptococcus porcinus (OR = 9.93, CI = 4.27 to 23.10), and Streptococcus suis (OR = 2.16, CI = 1.45 to 3.24). Tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for Staphylococcus aureus (OR = 0.05, CI = 0.005 to 0.482).
TI  - Structural modification of sanguinarine and chelerythrine and their antibacterial activity.
AB  - In this study, five derivatives of sanguinarine (1) and chelerythrine (2) were prepared, with 1 and 2 as starting materials, by reduction, oxidation and nucleophilic addition to the iminium bond C=N+. The structures of all compounds were elucidated on account of their MS, (1)H-NMR and (1)(3)C-NMR data. The antibacterial activities of all compounds were screened, using Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pasteurella multocida as test bacteria. The minimum bacteriostatic concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of the active compounds were determined by the turbidity method. The structure-activity relationships of 1 and 2 were discussed. The results showed that 1, 2 and their pseudoalcoholates were found to be potent inhibitors to S. aureus, E. coli and A. hydrophila, while the other derivatives were found to be inactive. The pseudoalcoholates might be the prodrugs of 1 and 2. The iminium bond in the molecules of 1 or 2 was the determinant for antibacterial activity, and the substituents at the 7 and 8 positions influenced the antibacterial activities of 1 and 2 against different bacteria.
TI  - Plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  - Florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in pigs caused by strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. Further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to be marginal for diseases caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/mL. An experiment was conducted during September and October 2009. One hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (Landrace-Yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. They were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. Two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). Water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by HPLC. Considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. However, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with MIC breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/mL. Decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with MIC >0.25 mug/mL, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of Streptococcus suis or E. coli to this drug.
TI  - Microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  - The tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. The goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. Tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. Samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. Aerobic cultivation identified Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. For culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16S rRNA sequences using the Ribosomal Database Project Pipeline programs developed at Michigan State University. Dominant genera identified by 16S rRNA analysis in pigs from both herds included Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Prevotella. These genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. In contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. In addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. Our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. This is the first analysis using 16S rRNA sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in the porcine upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
TI  - Acute infection of a total knee arthroplasty caused by Pasteurella multocida: a case report and a comprehensive review of the literature in the last 10 years.
AB  - Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) infection are most commonly due Staphylococcus aureus followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococci, while gram-negative rods are seldom isolated.(1,3,4) In the last 20 years, cases of Pasteurella multocida TKA and total hip arthroplasty (THA) infection resulting from cat and dog bites, scratches, or licks have been published reporting varying presentations and treatment options. Most commonly, P. multocida infected arthroplasties result in local tenderness, cellulitis, and purulent discharge followed by regional adenopathy, and in immunocompromised patients it may progress to septicemia, meningitis, and septic arthritis.(5) Treatment antibiotics include penicillins or 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins, and surgical options involve one-stage, or two-stage revision arthroplasties.(6,9,17,19) We report a case of P. multocida TKA infection in a patient who was treated successfully with a 3rd generation cephalosporin, synovectomy and tibial interspacer exchange, along with a review of the literature published in the last 10 years. Our findings show that there is usually a history of exposure to the animal, early appearance of cat bite related infections, and multifactorial decision making for the treatment of P. multocida joint infections.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel antibacterial peptide, avian beta-defensin 2 from ducks.
AB  - In this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD) was isolated from duck pancreas. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an 195 bp open reading frame encoding 64 amino acids. Homology, characterization and comparison of the gene with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that it was duck AvBD2. The mRNA expression of the gene was analyzed in 17 tissues from 21-day-old ducks. AvBD2 was highly expressed in the trachea, crop, heart, bone marrow, and pancreas; moderately expressed in the muscular stomach, small intestine, kidney, spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius; and weakly expressed in skin. We produced and purified recombinant AvBD2 by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. As expected, the recombinant peptide exhibited strong bactericidal properties against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pasteurella multocida, and weak bactericidal properties against E. coli and Salmonella choleraesuis. In addition, the recombinant protein retained antimicrobial activity against S. aureus under different temperatures (range, -20 degrees C to 100 degrees C) and pH values (range, 3 to 12).
TI  - Bite-related and septic syndromes caused by cats and dogs.
AB  - Bite infections can contain a mix of anaerobes and aerobes from the patient's skin and the animal's oral cavity, including species of Pasteurella, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Capnocytophaga. Domestic cat and dog bite wounds can produce substantial morbidity and often require specialised care techniques and specific antibiotic therapy. Bite wounds can be complicated by sepsis. Disseminated infections, particularly those caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Pasteurella multocida, can lead to septic shock, meningitis, endocarditis, and other severe sequelae. An emerging syndrome in veterinary and human medicine is meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections shared between pets and human handlers, particularly community-acquired MRSA disease involving the USA300 clone. Skin, soft-tissue, and surgical infections are the most common. MRSA-associated infections in pets are typically acquired from their owners and can potentially cycle between pets and their human acquaintances.
TI  - Alternative method for genetic transformation of Pasteurella multocida X73 using  a hyaluronidase-producing Staphylococcus aureus strain.
AB  - The hyaluronic acid-rich capsules make affected bacteria relatively retractile to transformation. In this work, native hyaluronidase produced in situ by Staphylococcus aureus, was investigated to replace the pure enzyme in bacterial capsule depolymerization and its subsequent genetic transformation. The encapsulated Pasteurella multocida X73 was cultivated as a mixed culture with a hyaluronidase-producing strain of S. aureus. Then different concentrations (50 ng and 200 ng) of the Pasteurella-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pPBA1100 were electro-transformed into 40 microl of the mentioned culture. Recombinants were selected on nutrient agar supplemented with 50 microg/ml of kanamycine (Kan). The effects of a capsule-weakening agent on electroporation rates were also evaluated. The use of this technique has allowed us to attain transformation frequencies 10(5) times higher than a previously available protocol using pure enzyme. A control experiment involving a non-hyaluronidase-producing strain S. aureus substantiated the effect of the staphylococcal enzyme. The proposed alternative method could be also used for genetic transformation for other capsulated bacteria, which is not possible without pure hyaluronidase.
TI  - Antibiograms of pathogenic bacteria isolated from laboratory rabbits in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of 21 bacterial isolates from some clinically ill New Zealand rabbits were evaluated against 12 commonly used antibiotics by the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion sensitivity testing method. The 21 isolates consisted of six Bordetella bronchiseptica, eight Pasteurella multocida, four Staphylococcus aureus and three Pseudomonas alcaligenes that were associated with snuffles, pneumonia, otitis media, genital infections and conjunctivitis in these groups of caged rabbits. The four bacteria species were all sensitive to kanamycin, gentamycin and enrofloxacin, with variable sensitivity to the other antibiotics tested. The results of this antibiogram could serve as a field guide in the treatment of very acute bacterial diseases of rabbit prior to the availability of the results of local sensitivity tests. Such sensitivity tests should be reviewed yearly to update this antibiogram.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different European countries: 2002-2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The project "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - II" (ARBAO-II) was funded by the European Union (FAIR5-QLK2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in European countries based on validated and harmonised methodologies. Available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. METHOD: Antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). Each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.A proficiency test (EQAS - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. The data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the EQAS the results are comparable between countries. RESULTS: Data from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 European countries. For Staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. The highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. For Mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in France, the Netherlands and Portugal. All isolates of Pasteurella multocida isolated in Finland and most of those from Denmark, England (and Wales), Italy and Sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus uberis isolates from Sweden were fully susceptible. For the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. More resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for Escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. CONCLUSION: In general, isolates from Denmark, England (and Wales), the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from Belgium, France, Italy, Latvia and Spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. In the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.
TI  - Terpenoid compositions, and antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the rhizome essential oils of different Hedychium species.
AB  - A phytochemical study of the rhizome essential oils of four different Hedychium species was performed by means of GC and GC/MS analyses. H. ellipticum mainly contained 1,8-cineole, sabinene, and terpin-4-ol, while H. aurantiacum possessed terpin-4-ol, para-cymene, and bornyl acetate as the major entities. Similarly, trans-meta-mentha-2,8-diene and linalool were noticed in H. coronarium. Three different collections (I-III) of H. spicatum showed amazing differences in the relative contents of their essential oils, 1,8-cineole and 10-epi-gamma-eudesmol being identified as markers for samples I and II, terpin-4-ol and sabinene being the major compounds in sample III. The rhizome essential oils of the above species were studied for their antioxidant activities by different methods, including their effect on the chelating properties of Fe(2+), DPPH radical-scavenging activity, and reducing power. Antimicrobial screenings of the oils by the paper-disc method were performed against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica enterica, and the respective minimum-inhibitory-concentration (MIC) values were determined. The rhizome essential oils from all Hedychium species exhibited moderate-to-good Fe(2+) chelating activity. H. spicatum from collection site III showed a completely different DPPH radical-scavenging profile than the samples from the other collection sites.
TI  - Evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  - The present trial was conducted in Hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. Rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. All rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. In outdoor sows Escherichia (E.) coli and Actinobaculum (A.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. Besides E. coli and A. suis, Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (Staphylococcus (S.) albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. were concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were concurrently found beside E. coli and A. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. In indoor sows E. coli and A. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus spp. were found beside E. coli and A. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. However only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of Clostridium spp., Arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, Streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (S. albus, S. epidermis, S. aureus), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and Klebsiella spp. IMPLICATIONS: in Eastern European climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.
TI  - Quantitative resistance level (MIC) of bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus) isolated from chickens and turkeys: national resistance monitoring by the BVL 2004/2005.
AB  - In the study 2004/2005, the current quantitative resistance level of Escherichia  coli, Pasteurella multocida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp. and Staphylococcus aureus from chickens and turkeys was determined for the first time within the framework of the National Resistance Monitoring of the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL). The objective was to implement a valid database on the basis of which the development and spread of resistance can be evaluated and monitored. During the investigation period from January 2004 to February 2005,927 strains were collected and 857 (92%) bacteria strains which corresponded to the specifications of the study protocol were tested with the broth microdilution method to determine the in vitro susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration) to 22 to 28 antimicrobial agents or antibiotic combinations. The results document a prevalence of resistance that exceeds that of bacterial pathogens of other animal species, especially in the case of tetracycline. Apart for S. aureus, clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones can still be considered low in poultry pathogens (E. coli approx. 2%). By applying the MICG of 4 mg/L for enrofloxacin, a susceptibility of approximately 78 % was calculated for S. aureus. A comparison of the prevalence of resistance between chickens and turkeys, showed that a slightly higher prevalence of resistance can be expected in turkeys. Differences between the susceptibility data of chicks and adult animals could only be found in turkeys. In the case of E. coli, the prevalence of resistance of strains isolated from adult turkeys was up to 10% higher than those isolated from chicks for the corresponding antimicrobial agents. It must be pointed out that the number of E. coli strains from adult turkeys was much higher (n = 194) than the number from turkey chicks (n = 21). The results indicate clearly that in a resistance monitoring system it is necessary to categorise poultry by animal species (chicken, turkey) as well as by production stage and type (broiler, laying hen), so that the epidemiology of resistance can be correctly represented and evaluated. This information is the basis for the development of long-term management options for minimizing antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the knowledge of prevailing resistance levels in Germany is a valuable tool for veterinary practitioners when determining an empirical therapy. The data collected by the BVL make an important contribution to the optimisation of the safety of food from animals, and thus to improving consumer protection.
TI  - Potential pathogens carried by Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern Spain.
AB  - The Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern Spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. We sampled 321 ibex (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with Sarcoptes scabiei. A total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 Mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with S. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. Infections with Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. With Escherichia coli, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida biotype A, and Staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher isolation rates were associated with adults. The isolation frequency for E. coli was higher in females, whereas Moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated with males. The presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and M. haemolytica. The geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of Branhamella ovis, M. agalactiae, and all Pasteurella sp. Isolations of M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, E. coli, and B. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging rather than captive animals. Of the gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. arginini were the predominant Mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. The most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria included E. coli, M. haemolytica, P. multocida biotype A, and B. ovis. Isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. In nasal samples, M. haemolytica and P. multocida biotype A were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, B. ovis and E. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.
TI  - Cat bite wound infections: a prospective clinical and microbiological study at three emergency wards in Stockholm, Sweden.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rate of infection following cat bites appears to be greater than that from dog bites. To study the clinical picture, complications and microbiology (in humans and cats), this prospective study was performed. METHODS: A prospective study with patients with clinical symptoms of infection due to cat bites from three emergency wards during two years in Stockholm, Sweden. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the wounds were performed as well as cultures from the biting cat's mouth. Clinical data and complications were registered. RESULTS: Seventy-nine episodes in 78 patients with infective cat bites were included. Pasteurella multocida was isolated in 70% of the patients; in addition anaerobic pathogens were isolated in 16% concurrently with P. multocida, while Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in only two patients. Pasteurella spp. was also isolated from 80% of the pharynx of the biting cats. The dominating symptoms of infection were erythema, pain and oedema, often emerging as early as 3h after the bite. Complications such as tendosynovitis, arthritis, abscesses and septicaemia occurred in 18% of the patients. No patient died due to the infection. The majority of the patients received penicillin or amoxicillin as antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: P. multocida was the dominating pathogen among patients with infected cat bites and antibiotic treatment should cover P. multocida.
TI  - Prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in Ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  - Visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across Ontario. Between May and July 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. One specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. All dogs were judged to be in good health. Zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. The primary pathogen was Clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. Seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase E. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the genus Salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. Giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Campylobacter spp., Microsporum canis, group A streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. Further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.
TI  - Dental follicle infection following a dog bite.
AB  - Animal bite wounds and their subsequent infection are relatively common. Incidence rates for dog bites are significantly higher among children aged 0-9 years, especially among boys. Although bite wounds may initially look innocuous, they frequently lead to serious infection with a potential for life-threatening complications. The microbiology of dog bite wounds is usually polymicrobial, typically including anaerobes, Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella species. A case is described of a 22-month-old boy who, subsequent to a dog bite over the left maxilla, suffered infection of the dental follicle of the primary maxillary canine with Pasteurella multocida. The infection proved difficult to treat, requiring several attempts at incision and drainage of the abscess together with systemic antibiotics, and resulted in the eventual loss of the tooth.
TI  - Facial bite wounds: management update.
AB  - Bite wounds are frequently located on the face; injuries inflicted by dogs are most common, especially in children. Bacteriology of infected dog and cat bite wounds includes Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, viridans streptococci, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, and oral anaerobes. Infected human bites yield a similar spectrum of bacteria except for Pasteurellae and C. canimorsus; instead human bites are frequently complicated by Eikenella corrodens. Antibiotic therapy against these bacteria is indicated both for infected bite wounds and fresh wounds considered at risk for infection. Amoxicillin-clavulanate (and other combinations of extended-spectrum penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors) and moxifloxacin offer the best in vitro coverage of the pathogenic flora. Initial wound management consisting in irrigation and debridement is at least equally important with antibiotics for prevention of infection. The need for prophylaxis against systemic infectious complications, particularly tetanus, should also be evaluated. Primary surgical repair is the treatment of choice for most clinically uninfected facial bite wounds, whereas delayed closure should be reserved for certain high risk or already infected wounds. Avulsive injuries with significant tissue loss represent the most difficult cases for definitive management and are also those most likely to require hospitalization.
TI  - [Surgical therapy for hand infections. Part I].
AB  - Due to its function, anatomy, and exposition to multiple pathogens, the hand is highly susceptible to infection. Most of these infections are post-traumatic. Isolates of pathogens from infected hands contain mainly Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci. We find Pasteurella canis and P. multocida from cat and dog bite wounds and Eikenella corrodens from human bite wounds. The "fight-bite clenched fist" wound, with penetration of the metacarpophalangeal joint and its high risk of septic arthritis, has always to be suspected when patients present with human bites. The therapy of hand infection is based on three principles: surgical treatment, adequate antimicrobial therapy, and early physiotherapy. Early infectious conditions of the hand, e.g. cellulitis and early paronychia, may be treated without surgery. Antimicrobial treatment must be specific for the pathogen and its resistance to antimicrobial agents. Bite wounds should be treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors. Staphylococci and streptococci can be covered by first and second generation cephalosporins. The increasing resistance of staphylococci to antibiotics has to be taken into account. Infections with anaerobic and gas-producing bacteria are rare but occur predominantly in diabetics and immune-compromised individuals.
TI  - [Bite wound infections].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lifetime risk of experiencing a bite wound, human or animal, is approximately 50%, and bite wounds account for approximately 1% of all visits to emergency departments. The majority of bite wounds are inflicted by dogs and cats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of bite wound infections is presented. RESULTS: The most common pathogens associated with bite wounds are Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus species, Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and anaerobic bacteria. Sporadically other pathogens are isolated from bite wounds. Human bites differ from animal bites by higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and Eikenella corrodens. INTERPRETATION: It is important to be aware of the possibility of complicating infections following bite wounds, particularly after cat bites. Phenoxymethyl penicillin should be the drug of choice in treatment of infections associated with cat and dog bites. However, in case of slow recovery or no improvement, simultaneous lymphadenopathy or pneumonia, S. aureus or Francisella tularensis should be suspected; ciprofloxacin is recommended. For human bite infections the recommend treatment is phenoxymethyl penicillin in combination with penicillinase-stable penicillin.
TI  - Seven years survey of susceptibility to marbofloxacin of bovine pathogenic strains from eight European countries.
AB  - This study was conducted from 1994 to 2001 to determine the susceptibility of bovine pathogenic bacteria to marbofloxacin (a third generation fluoroquinolone used only in individual administration for animals). Strains originated in bovine diseases from eight European countries. They were isolated from gut infections (Escherichia coli, salmonellae), mastitis (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae) and respiratory diseases (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus). There was no change in the MIC distributions for each species after the launch of marbofloxacin in 1997. In E. coli, a resistant population was present before the use of marbofloxacin having been induced by co- or cross-resistance to other antibiotics used previously. Over this period the only a significant change seen was an increase in MIC(90) of E. coli from the gut (1.275 microg/ml in 1994/1995 to 5.098 microg/ml in 2001). All the salmonellae were susceptible to marbofloxacin with a MIC(90) = 0.073 microg/ml in 2001 without development of high level resistance. The use of marbofloxacin seems not to have favoured a significant increase and spreading of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of Pasteurella multocida isolated from rabbits by capsular typing, somatic serotyping, and restriction endonuclease analysis.
AB  - The goal of this study was to characterize Pasteurella multocida isolated from rabbits. Five hundred and fifty-three apparently healthy rabbits were sampled for this study. Nasal swabs were collected from each rabbit for P. multocida isolation and identification. Isolates were further characterized by capsular and somatic antigens and genomic DNA fingerprinting. Thirty-nine P. multocida isolates were recovered from 553 rabbits (7%). Capsular typing was done by depolymerization of P. multocida capsule by Staphylococcus aureus hyaluronidase and by disc diffusion with mucopolysaccharidase enzymes (heparinase III, chondroitinase AC, and hyaluronidase). Thirty-one (79%) of the isolates were capsular type A, and 8 isolates (21%) had untypable (UT) capsules. The gel-diffusion precipitin test was used to determine the somatic type of P. multocida isolates. Nineteen isolates were somatic serotype 3 (49%), 12 were serotype 1 (31%), 1 was serotype 2, 2 were serotype 5, 2 were serotype 12 with a weak reaction to antiserum raised against serotype 7 (5%), and 1 was serotype 4. Two of the isolates (5%) were UT. Restriction endonuclease analysis of the DNA of the isolates revealed 7 distinct profiles by digestion with HindIII, and 12 profiles were obtained with HpaII, whereas digestion with EcoRI did not differentiate between any of the P. multocida DNA isolates studied. The DNA restriction endonuclease enzyme HpaII was found more useful for differentiating between DNA fingerprints of P. multocida rabbit isolates. However, no correlation between capsular type, somatic serotypes, and DNA fingerprints was seen in this study.
TI  - Oral bacterial flora of dogs with and without rabies: a preliminary study in Thailand.
AB  - The authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, Aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. A total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. The most frequently isolated organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pasteurella species. There were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. From the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. One or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. Two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. The predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds were, as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Moraxella species, Pasteurella canis, and Enterobacter cloacae. However, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. The results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.
TI  - [Experimental empyema in rats through intrapleural injection of bacteria]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate empyema formation in rats through the injection of two bacteria (Pasteurella multocida and Staphylococcus aureus), using a simple, easy-to-use surgical technique. METHODS: Twenty four anesthetized Wistar white rats, 250-300g in weight, submitted to right anterior thoracotomy, muscular retraction and injection of a 0.2ml solution into pleural space according the following scheme: Group I (n=12): injection of 10(10) Pasteurella multocida cultured in brain heart infusion broth. Group II (n=8): injection of 10(10) Staphylococcus aureus cultured in brain heart infusion broth. Group III (n=4): injection of bacterium-free brain heart infusion (control). The rats were sacrificed after seven days, and pleural reaction was assessed by macroscopy. Mortality, and intrathoracic liquid volume were evaluated, and bacteriological tests were also performed. RESULTS: Seven rats died within the first 48 hours in Group I (Pasteurella multocida); five completed the experiment, but none of them presented empyema. Only one animal died within the first 24 hours in Group II (Staphylococcus aureus); seven (88%) presented empyema at the time of sacrifice. All animals survived in Group III (control), without empyema or thoracic abnormalities. Pleural inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus (Group II) was significantly associated with empyema formation (P<0.001). In this group, the amount of pleural liquid ranged from 0.9 to 3.9ml. CONCLUSION: It is possible to induce empyema in rats through Staphylococcus aureus pleural injection by a simple surgical technique. Differently from other experiments, the pleural injection of Pasteurella multocida did not provoke empyema in rats.
TI  - Surveillance for antibiotic resistance in veterinary pathogens from the perspective of a regional diagnostic laboratory.
AB  - The Toowoomba Veterinary Laboratory tests for antibiotic resistance through passive surveillance of bacterial pathogens from diseased, frequently intensively managed, animals. Testing is carried out on the basis of the number of animals involved, the nature and severity of the disease and the identity and significance of the bacterium, the results guiding the submitting veterinarian in implementing appropriate treatment. The antibiotics chosen for testing are those that are currently registered for veterinary use and are considered effective in the given situation. Testing is carried out according to the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Approved Standard for Disc Susceptibility Tests. This paper presents some results of testing bacterial pathogens from cattle and pigs.
TI  - Azalide 3,6-ketals: antibacterial activity and structure-activity relationships of aryl and hetero aryl substituted analogues.
AB  - Aryl and hetero aryl substituted 3,6-ketals of 15-membered azalide analogues were synthesized and were found to have potent in vitro antibacterial activity against veterinary pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - Variability of neutrophil and pulmonary alveolar macrophage function in swine.
AB  - Neutrophils and alveolar macrophages are essential defence mechanisms against bacterial infection of the lung. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the variability of a panel of neutrophil and alveolar macrophage function assays in swine, and to determine if the function of these leukocytes differed at various stages of production. Measured neutrophil functions included chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and degranulation. Phagocytosis and oxidative burst were measured in alveolar macrophages isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Both neutrophil and alveolar macrophage functions were highly variable from day-to-day and between pigs. Individual pigs did not have consistently high or low neutrophil and macrophage responses over time when compared to their cohorts. Older grower-finisher pigs had significantly greater neutrophil oxidative burst responses than younger suckling and weaner pigs (P < 0.001). Similarly, alveolar macrophages from suckling and early weaner pigs less than 40 days of age had significantly lower oxidative burst responses than those from older pigs (P = 0.02). Age-related variation in phagocytosis, chemotaxis, or granule secretion were not detected. These results establish baseline data for individual and age-related variation in swine leukocyte function, and form a basis for further evaluation of the contribution of non-infectious factors to development of the porcine respiratory disease complex.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  - The skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. Skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. Environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. Resident gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium sp. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. In order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. Bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. Epidermal infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. Dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. The pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. Moreover, S. aureus and S. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, Bartonella sp., Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and Vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.
TI  - [The current antimicrobial resistance situation in Swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight Swiss laboratories from May 1999 to February 2000. Using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococci, and enterococci. Differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in E. coli and salmonella. Some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. A significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. This includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli. A similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid. Staphylococci from dogs (S. intermedius and S. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. Finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in Switzerland is relatively favorable.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of thiotetronic acid analogues of  thiolactomycin.
AB  - 3-Acetyl analogues of thiolactomycin, a thiotetronic acid natural product, were synthesized and profiled against livestock pathogens. Some analogues showed improved activity over thiolactomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and comparable activity against Pasteurella multocida. Several semisynthetically modified analogues of thiolactomycin showed no improvement in activity over thiolactomycin.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of porcine respiratory pathogens to tilmicosin.
AB  - Bacterial isolates obtained from swine with various clinical diseases were tested for susceptibility to tilmicosin by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion tests using National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards methodology. The tilmicosin MIC90 was < or =0.125 microg/ml for Erysiopelothrix rhusiopathiae, < or = 1 microg/ml for Haemophilus parasuis isolates, 8 microg/ml for Actinobacillus suis and Pasteurella multocida type A, 16 microg/ml for toxigenic and nontoxigenic P. multocida type D, 64 microg/ml for Bordetella bronchiseptica, and >128 microg/ml for Staphylococcus hyicus and Streptococcus suis. The results of disk diffusion testing matched well with the MIC results for each pathogen. This in vitro survey of tilmicosin activity against various swine isolates suggests that further clinical evaluation of tilmicosin in swine may be warranted for disease associated with E. rhusiopathiae, H. parasuis, and A. suis but not B. bronchiseptica, S. suis, or S. hyicus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) CFU/spot for aerobes and 10(5) CFU for anaerobes. The following are the MIC ranges and MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of ABT-773 for various isolates, respectively: Pasteurella multocida and Pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other Pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; Eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. For anaerobes the MIC ranges and MIC(90)s of ABT-773 were as follows, respectively: Prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; Prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; Porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml; Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other Fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; Bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. ABT-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against S. aureus, E. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against F. nucleatum. The activity of ABT-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against Pasteurella spp., and ABT-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against Pasteurella spp. ABT-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.
TI  - Recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  - Macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as Legionella, Chlamydia, Campylobacter spp, Branhamella spp, Pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. Emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes are found in France and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. RU 004, HMR 3647, and TE 802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. Research at Abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-O-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae. Research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. Another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. Ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. Bacterial resistance ( such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. Many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. The new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. This presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.
TI  - Effects of enrofloxacin on porcine phagocytic function.
AB  - The interaction between enrofloxacin and porcine phagocytes was studied with clinically relevant concentrations of enrofloxacin. Enrofloxacin accumulated in phagocytes, with cellular concentration/extracellular concentration ratios of 9 for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and 5 for alveolar macrophages (AMs). Cells with accumulated enrofloxacin brought into enrofloxacin-free medium released approximately 80% (AMs) to 90% (PMNs) of their enrofloxacin within the first 10 min, after which no further release was seen. Enrofloxacin affected neither the viability of PMNs and AMs nor the chemotaxis of PMNs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 microg/ml. Enrofloxacin (0.5 microg/ml) did not alter the capability of PMNs and AMs to phagocytize fluorescent microparticles or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, and Staphylococcus aureus. Significant differences in intracellular killing were seen with enrofloxacin at 5x the MIC compared with that for controls not treated with enrofloxacin. PMNs killed all S. aureus isolates in 3 h with or without enrofloxacin. Intracellular S. aureus isolates in AMs were less susceptible than extracellular S. aureus isolates to the bactericidal effect of enrofloxacin. P. multocida was not phagocytosed by PMNs. AMs did not kill P. multocida, and similar intra- and extracellular reductions of P. multocida isolates by enrofloxacin were found. Intraphagocytic killing of A. pleuropneumoniae was significantly enhanced by enrofloxacin at 5x the MIC in both PMNs and AMs. AMs are very susceptible to the A. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin. This suggests that in serologically naive pigs the enhancing effect of enrofloxacin on the bactericidal action of PMNs may have clinical relevance.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of N-duopropenide, a recently developed disinfectant containing quaternary ammonium compounds, against selected gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of N-duopropenide against various gram-positive  and gram-negative organisms. SAMPLE POPULATION: One field strain each of Pasteurella multocida subsp multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and L ivanovii, and 2 field strains of Escherichia coli. PROCEDURE: Strains were tested with and without serum as organic matter, using quantitative suspension and carrier tests. Six concentrations of active ingredient (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.11, 0.27, and 0.55%) and 6 contact times (15 and 30 seconds and 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes) were studied for each. RESULTS: Globally, N-duopropenide was more effective in suspension tests than in carrier tests, and when organisms were suspended in saline solution rather than serum. Under the most disadvantageous conditions (carrier test with serum), a concentration of 0.55% N-duopropenide acting for only 15 seconds was effective in inactivating P multocida subsp multocida and was even more effective against the 2 Listeria species tested. For E coli strains, the same concentration also was effective, but after 10 minutes of contact. On the other hand, N-duopropenide was unable to inactivate the S aureus strain in the carrier test with serum, a concentration of 0.55% for 10 minutes was necessary to inactivate it without organic matter; however, N-duopropenide was highly effective against this organism in the suspension test, even with serum. CONCLUSION: N-duopropenide was highly effective in vitro against 5 of the most commonly encountered organisms in clinical veterinary medicine and, consequently, might be a good choice in control measures against common pathogenic organisms in modern production systems.
TI  - Targeting lurking pathogens in acute traumatic and chronic wounds.
AB  - The appropriate antimicrobial treatment for skin and soft tissue following acute  trauma is determined by the mechanism of injury, time from injury to treatment, environmental wound contamination, pathogenicity of colonizing bacteria, and patient-specific issues. These factors can be used to predict the risk of secondary infection of wounds. Although common skin pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus) cause most secondary wound infections, antibiotic therapy sometimes must be directed against unusual pathogens that are associated with atypical wounds, such as animal bites (amoxicillin with clavulanate for Pasteurella multocida) and plantar puncture wounds (ciprofloxacin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This customized treatment approach is also appropriate for chronic wounds, such as pressure and diabetic foot ulcers. In addition to antibiotic therapy, wound management may include surgical debridement. Active areas of investigation in wound management include the use of growth factors and hyperbaric oxygen.
TI  - Septic arthritis of the hand and wrist.
AB  - Septic arthritis of the hand and wrist is relatively uncommon. The most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a human or animal bite. The most common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus. Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcal species. Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pasteurella multocida, Eikenella corrodens, and Mycobacterium marinum also may occur in specific clinical settings. The best clinical results occur following an accurate diagnosis, prompt surgical drainage, and debridement in concert with appropriate antibiotics and early postoperative range of motion. A delay in diagnosis or treatment is associated with an unsatisfactory outcome.
TI  - Postmortem detection of acute septicemia in broilers.
AB  - Septicemia is an unwholesome condition diagnosed during postmortem inspection in  poultry slaughter establishments on the basis of macroscopic lesions. Early identification of septicemia has important public health implications. In this study, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus septicemia were induced in broilers in order to determine if lesions of acute septicemia can be grossly detected in the visceral organs of broiler carcasses prior to the development of changes in the skeletal muscle. Increased spleen and liver weights were observed during the acute phase of septicemia. Airsacculitis, pericarditis, and perihepatitis were observed during the acute phase of P. multocida- and E. coli-induced septicemia; and arthritis was the earliest indicator of S. aureus-induced septicemia. These macroscopic lesions were sufficient to identify unwholesome septicemic broiler carcasses prior to the development of changes in the skeletal muscle of the carcass.
TI  - Bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (H) versus unhealthy (UH) animals with respiratory signs. The prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract of H and UH Najdi sheep, Somali sheep and Holstein calves. The characteristics of Pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of Pasteurella haemolytica were identified in H and UH animals, Eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of UH Najdi and Somali sheep and Holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of UH sheep were Moraxella spp., Pseudomonas pseudomallei, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in UH calves were Pasteurella haemolytica, Actinomyces spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of UH animals, namely Actinomyces pyogenes, Erysipelothrix spp., P. haemolytica, Pasteurella ureae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of the animals surveyed. Of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified P. haemolytica and P. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from UH as compared to those from H animals. These were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of P. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of P. multocida recovered from healthy animals. The only biotype of P. haemolytica isolated from H animals was biotype A, while both biotypes A (88.0% of the isolates) and T (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from UH animals.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. A total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. Though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the 495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). In 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. Streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), Actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), Pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). Staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and Streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). Among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as S. suis, the major serotype was S. suis type 2 (35.4%). The remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). A total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.
TI  - Species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  - Siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. Several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. Overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). E. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-OH-N-OH-delta-N-acetyl-L-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). B. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine B and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. P. multocida and P. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. Individual siderophores did not promote S. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. The antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. Conjugate-resistant E. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a novel antibacterial agent (Bac1829) Produced by Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829.
AB  - A novel antimicrobial agent from Staphylococcus aureus KSI1829, designated Bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Purified Bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 Da. The peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating at 95 degrees C for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of Ala and Gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. Additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of Bac1829. Purified Bac1829 killed exponentially growing Corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. A partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of Bac1829: S. aureus RN4220, Streptococcus suis, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, C. renale, Corynebacterium diptheriae, Haemophilus parasuis, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella bronchoseptica, Moraxella bovis, and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - [Development of resistance in infectious agents of agricultural animals in Germany (1990-1994)--a review].
AB  - Antibiograms received from veterinary laboratories during the 1990-1994 period were recorded and evaluated with the aid of a computer program. Based on 70 tables giving information about th most important pathogens, the resistance behaviour of E. coli in cattle, swine, chicken, and turkey, that of Pasteurella haemolytica and P. multocida in cattle and swine and that of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in cattle have been in synoptic form. Attention is drawn to the increase in resistance to enrofloxacin shown by E. coli, particularly in turkeys.
TI  - [Infectious burdens of reproduction of female dogs].
AB  - The results of gynecological investigations in 142 bitches were evaluated and the complexity of infectious affections is discussed. High proportions of infectious cases were found in cases of limitation of fertility (67.5%), in vaginal discharge in the estrus (60.8%), in cases of mastitis/pseudopregnancy (61.5%) and in mortality of newborn puppies. St. aureus and E. coli were often isolated. There is a high etiological correlation in epidemiology of diseases of the reproductive tract in the single bitch and especially in kennel bitches.
TI  - [Are nasal swabs for swine appropriate for the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia agents?].
AB  - Nasal swabs and lungs of 150 pigs with pneumonia were tested by culture at post mortem examination. The isolated agents were Pasteurella multocida (P.m.), P. haemolytica, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli. P.m. was most frequently found, and this agent only showed a significant correlation between lungs and nasal swabs. In 80.6% of pigs with P.m. in the lung the agent was detected in the nose, too. Drug resistance patterns of P.m. isolates from lungs and noses of the single animals were identical or similar, also in case of different capsular types. The examination of porcine nasal swabs for bacteria capable of causing pneumonia should be limited to P. multocida. Demonstration of agents in lung material is generally more certain.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of marbofloxacin. A new fluoroquinolone for veterinary use against canine and feline isolates.
AB  - Marbofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone developed exclusively for veterinary use.  Minimum inhibitory concentrations of marbofloxacin were assessed for 816 recent isolates associated with canine or feline diseases. Marbofloxacin showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. In vitro rates of killing of marbofloxacin and enrofloxacin were compared against strains of Staphylococcus intermedius and Pasteurella multocida, and the results showed no marked difference between the two antibiotics. The duration of bactericidal activity was evaluated ex vivo in the urine of dogs and cats treated with marbofloxacin and lasted from 2 to 5 days after a single administration according to the dosages. Post-antibiotic effect durations were determined with Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius and were found almost equal to those of enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These results predict a great potential for marbofloxacin in the treatment of a wide range of diseases in dogs and cats.
TI  - Proposed quality control guidelines for antimicrobial susceptibility tests using  tilmicosin.
AB  - Quality control guidelines for tilmicosin, a novel veterinary-use-only macrolide, were developed in a multi-laboratory study according to established National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) procedures (M23-T2). Tilmicosin was incorporated into Sensititre plates for broth microdilution endpoint testing and into two lots of 15-micrograms disks for Kirby-Bauer agar disk diffusion testing. One common lot and five unique lots of Mueller-Hinton media were used. (Broth was cation adjusted, and agar was supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood.) Bacteria used for reference strains included Pasteurella haemolytica 128K, Pasteurella multocida ATCC 43137, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (microdilution) and ATCC 25923 (disk). Replicate tests were conducted. Disk diffusion and broth microdilution quality control ranges are proposed.
TI  - Humoral immunity in cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus or leukaemia virus.
AB  - The humoral antibody responses of 82 domestic cats to the common commensal bacteria Pasteurella multocida and Staphylococcus aureus were measured by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to give a subjective quantification of specific IgG in serum. There was no significant difference in specific serum IgG levels between sick cats which tested antibody-positive to feline immunodeficiency virus or antigen-positive to feline leukaemia virus and sick, virus-negative cats. This finding suggested that there was no change in immune status, as measured by this method, in both feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus infections, although, based on clinical signs shown by the virus-positive cats, overall immunosuppression was indicated. Feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus infection may have an effect on cellular immunity, as is the case with human immunodeficiency virus.
TI  - Capsular hyaluronic acid in Pasteurella multocida type A and its counterpart in type D.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid was demonstrated in the capsule extract of 39/39 Pasteurella multocida type A strains by sodium chloride gradient chromatography followed by Alcian blue staining, and by a turbidometric method using acidified horse serum. Treatment with hyaluronidase from various sources eliminated these reactions. An Alcian blue staining substance of closely similar chromatographic properties occurred in capsule extracts of 14/16 type D strains but it resisted hyaluronidase and was thought to be an acidic polysaccharide differing from the hyaluronic acid of type A. Turbidometric values were lower than with type A strains, but were unaltered by hyaluronidase treatment. The type D substance could be precipitated from capsule extract by acriflavin. Both type A and D strains were mucoid and displayed large capsule zones in stained preparations. Photomicrographic measurements showed that hyaluronidase treatment of cell suspensions markedly reduced capsule dimensions of type A but not type D strains. When type A strains were cross streaked against a hyaluronidase + Staphylococcus aureus, their growth became non-mucoid at the intersection: mucoid type D strains were unaffected. Neither hyaluronic acid nor the hyaluronidase resistant type D substance could be detected in type B or E strains.
TI  - Leishmania major: bacterial contamination of cutaneous lesions in experimental animals.
AB  - No bacterial contamination has been demonstrated in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)  nodule and in lesions caused by Leishmania major in Balb/c mice up to 20 days after infection. However, although many phagocytic cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) were present in the CL lesion, 80% of the lesions showed bacterial contamination that developed within the first 70 days of infection. Topical treatment of the lesion with an ointment containing 15% paromomycin and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin for 20 days eliminated all the Leishmania parasites and several of the associated bacteria including: Proteus vulgaris, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus albus and Staphylococcus aureus. This treatment did not affect Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Total elimination of these bacteria was achieved only during the healing process, and within 20 days following termination of treatment. The rate of disappearance of bacteria inoculated alone into the base of the tail of normal uninfected Balb/c mice was much faster than that of bacteria inoculated into either the CL nodule or the CL lesion. This study suggests the development of local immunosuppression in the CL lesion that may be mediated by the Leishmania parasites and their metabolites.
TI  - Turkey macrophage and heterophil bactericidal activity against Pasteurella multocida.
AB  - Bactericidal activity of turkey macrophages and heterophils was demonstrated in an in vitro colorimetric bactericidal assay. Two vaccine strains and one field isolate of Pasteurella multocida A:3,4 and a single isolate each of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were compared for susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of turkey macrophages and heterophils. Only P. multocida A:3,4-strain M-9 (the least virulent strain) was susceptible to macrophage bactericidal activity in the absence of specific immune serum, whereas all three P. multocida A:3,4 organisms were killed when opsonized with specific immune serum. E. coli was susceptible to the bactericidal activity of macrophages, and S. aureus was resistant. All bacteria tested were highly sensitive to the bactericidal activity of intact turkey heterophils, regardless of the opsonin treatment. Electron microscopic findings suggested that heterophils may kill extracellular P. multocida. Only S. aureus and E. coli were killed by lysed heterophils.
TI  - Bite wounds and infection.
AB  - One of every two Americans will be bitten by an animal or by another person at some point. Bites account for approximately 1% of all visits to emergency rooms; injuries inflicted by dogs are most common. The bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds include Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, and other members of the oral flora. Anaerobic bacteria are present in approximately one-third of bite wounds and are associated with the formation of abscesses and with relatively serious infections. P. multocida is found in infections of cat bites more than 50% of the time. The bacteriology of bite wounds inflicted by exotic animals reflects the animals' oral flora. Bites inflicted by humans are often more serious than those inflicted by animals. Infections of human bites are associated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci, S. aureus, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus species, and (in more than 50% of cases) anaerobic bacteria. The principles of management of bite wounds are discussed.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical PPR: isolation and identification.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic West African dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. From a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. The percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: Staphylococcus 44.0%; Streptococcus 22.67%; Neisseria 12.00%; Pasteurella 10.67%; Pseudomonas 4.00%; Proteus 4.00% and Corynebacterium 1.33%. A further break-down using biochemical tests revealed that Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67% of the total bacteria isolates; Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; Streptococcus viridans 18.67%; Streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; Neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; Proteus mirabilis 2.67%; Proteus rettgeri 1.33%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; Pasteurella multocida 4.00%; Pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and Corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.
TI  - Bovine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor enhancement of bovine neutrophil functions in vitro.
AB  - Neutrophils were purified from blood of dexamethasone-treated (0.04 mg/kg of body weight) and untreated calves. Cells were untreated (controls) or cultured in media containing 5 or 10 ng of bovine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rbGM-CSF)/ml for 10 to 12 hours before being tested for various functions. Dexamethasone treatment of calves decreased luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, decreased phagocytosis of Pasteurella multocida and several Staphylococcus spp by various degrees, and decreased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against bovine herpesvirus-infected cells by 26 to 32%. The percentage phagocytosis of coagulase-positive S aureus and S intermedius was higher than that of coagulase-negative S epidermidis for neutrophils from all calves. Culture of neutrophils with rbGM-CSF significantly increased (P less than 0.05) all of the aforementioned functions, compared with control neutrophils; however, rbGM-CSF-induced increases in function tended to be higher in neutrophils from dexamethasone-treated calves than in neutrophils from untreated calves.
TI  - Monoclonal antibody in the identification of Haemophilus somnus.
AB  - Electrophoretic comparisons of outer membrane proteins of Haemophilus somnus isolates revealed 2 major protein bands (46 and 14 kilodaltons [kD]) common to all isolates tested. A monoclonal antibody raised against H. somnus reacted to the 46-kD band. Coagglutination tests were performed using a monoclonal antibody coagglutination assay. The monoclonal reagent was produced by incubating Cowan strain Staphylococcus aureus suspension, used as a source of crude protein A, with mouse ascitic fluid monoclonal antibody or goat anti-H. somnus hyperimmune serum. Bacteria to be tested were suspended at a concentration of 4.5 x 10(9) cells/ml. The coagglutination test was performed by the addition of 50 microliters of the monoclonal reagent to 50 microliters of the bacterial suspension on a glass plate and manual rotation for 2-3 minutes. The coagglutination assay using Cowan strain Staphylococcus aureus protein A, coupled with the monoclonal antibody, agglutinated 10 different H. somnus isolates. The antibody reagent did not coagglutinate with Actinobacillus suis, A. equuli, Pasteurella haemolytica, P. multocida, or P. pneumotropica under similar test conditions.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  - In vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. A microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). The following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: Staphylococcus aureus, S intermedius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Ent cloacae, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus sp, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, Proteus vulgaris, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included S aureus, S intermedius, Ent aerogenes, Ent agglomerans, Pasteurella multocida, B bronchiseptica, Pr mirabilis, and Serratia sp.
TI  - Kill kinetics of the cephalosporin antibiotics cephalexin and cefuroxime against  bacteria of veterinary importance.
AB  - Kill kinetic studies for two cephalosporin antibiotics, cephalexin and cefuroxime were carried out against veterinary strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus suis, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and a laboratory culture of Staphylococcus aureus. In more than 90 per cent of cases a kill of more than 99 per cent was achieved within four hours of antibiotic treatment at concentrations of 2 or 4 micrograms/ml. Although cefuroxime was effective at lower concentrations than cephalexin the rates of kill of the two antibiotics were comparable. The results are discussed in relation to in vivo dosage regimens.
TI  - Comparative activities of cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from bite wounds.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activities of 10 oral antimicrobial agents against 147 aerobic and 61 anaerobic bacteria making up species in 13 genera (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus-Actinobacillus spp., M-5, EF-4, Moraxella spp., Flavobacterium IIb, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp.) that were isolated from bite wounds. Cefuroxime was generally greater than fourfold more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against all aerobic isolates, including Pasteurella multocida. The fluoroquinolones were highly active against most aerobic isolates but were less active against anaerobic isolates. Ciprofloxacin was generally more active than either enoxacin or ofloxacin. Discrepancies of greater than 30% in the interpretation of susceptibilities between break points suggested by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and those related to oral dose peak levels (one-half to one-quarter of maximum achievable concentrations) were noted in 14% (18 of 130) of the instances.
TI  - Evaluation of the specificity and sensitivity of two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, the serum plate agglutination test, and the hemagglutination-inhibition test for antibodies formed in response to Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
AB  - Two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, seven serum plate  agglutination (SPA) antigens, and the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test for antibodies to Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) were compared for sensitivity and specificity using known MG-positive and MG-negative sera from leghorn chickens. All SPA antigens proved to be highly sensitive when testing MG-positive sera. Laboratory-prepared SPA antigens yielded fewer positive reactions when testing MG-negative sera than commercial SPA antigens. Both MG ELISA kits showed high rates of positive reactions when testing sera from birds given commercial M. synoviae bacterin, fowl coryza (Haemophilus paragallinarum) bacterin, inactivated infectious bursal disease virus vaccine, and to a lesser extent fowl cholera (Pasteurella multocida) bacterin. Immunization with Frey's medium with 12% swine serum-in-oil or Staphylococcus aureus-in-oil resulted in sera which yielded numerous positive ELISA reactions. During the first 1 to 3 weeks, antibodies induced by experimental infection with MG were better detected by the SPA test than by the ELISAs and the HI test, thus confirming the SPA test's importance in Mycoplasma diagnostic serology. The HI test can serve to confirm positive SPA results.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - The comparative in-vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. The new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l). Among other Gram-positive organisms tested, a significant number were resistant to A-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. A-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against Pasteurella multocida and Campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against Legionella spp. (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/l) and Bact. melaninogenicus (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). Activity of A-56268 was pH dependent (more active at pH 7 than at pH 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. The drug was bactericidal against two strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Str. faecalis.
TI  - Pyogenic osteomyelitis of the occiput, the atlas, and the axis. A report of five  cases.
AB  - Pyogenic osteomyelitis rarely affects the first and second cervical vertebrae, and when it does it can progress to abscess formation, compressing the spinal cord. If the process is unrecognized, it can be fatal. The cases of five patients are reported. Two patients were treated by anterior debridement and posterior cervical-occipital arthrodesis; one, by transoral drainage; one, by posterior cervical-occipital arthrodesis; and the fifth, by posterior atlanto-axial arthrodesis. The causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in four patients and Pasteurella multocida in one. In all patients, intravenous antibiotics were used, followed by prolonged administration of oral antibiotics. All five patients recovered.
TI  - Ceftiofur sodium, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin: evaluation in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Ceftiofur sodium, a broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in mice. Ceftiofur is the sodium salt of (6R, 7R)-7[( 2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-Z- (methoxyimino)acetyl]amino)-3-[( (2-furanylcarbonyl)thio]methyl)-8-oxo-5- thia-1-azabicyclo-[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate. Minimal inhibitory concentration values were obtained with 264 strains representing 9 genera and 17 species of bacterial pathogens from cattle, swine, sheep, horses, poultry, dogs, cats, and human beings. Ceftiofur was more active than was ampicillin against all strains tested including beta-lactamase-producing organisms. In mice with systemic infections, ceftiofur was more active than or equivalent to ampicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole, cloxacillin, cefoperazone, or pirlimycin. These protection tests included infections with Escherichia coli, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, H somnus, Pasteurella haemolytica, P multocida, Salmonella typhimurium, or Staphylococcus aureus. In infant mice with E coli-induced lethal diarrhea and in mice with S aureus and E coli-induced mastitis, ceftiofur was comparable or more active than was ampicillin.
TI  - Microbiology of human and animal bite wounds in children.
AB  - Aspirates from bite wounds in 39 children (21 with animal bites and 18 with human bites) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 7 (18%) wounds, anaerobic bacteria only in 3 (8%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 29 (74%). A total of 59 isolates was recovered from animal bites (2.8/specimen): 37 aerobes (1.8/specimen); and 22 anaerobes (1.0/specimen). A total of 97 isolates were recovered from human bites (5.4/specimen): 44 aerobes (2.4/specimen); and 53 anaerobes (3.0/specimen). The most frequent isolates in both types of wounds were Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic cocci and Bacteroides spp. Present only in animal bites were Pasteurella multocida, Pseudomonas fluorescens and M-5. Present only in human bites were Group A streptococci. Eighteen beta-lactamase-producing organisms were isolated in 16 wounds. This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of human and animal bite wounds.
TI  - Response of sheep and cattle to combined polyvalent Pasteurella haemolytica vaccines.
AB  - The antibody response to various combined polyvalent Pasteurella haemolytica vaccines was studied in sheep and cattle. In sheep, certain oil adjuvant vaccines gave rise to a better antibody response to P. haemolytica than an A1(OH)3-adsorbed vaccine. This finding, however, was not consistent for all serotypes, and with respect to P. multocida, oil adjuvants had no advantage. Furthermore, it was found that the removal of all the culture supernatant fluid during the production process had no deleterious effect on the antigenicity of the product. In cattle, good responses were obtained with both alum-precipitated and A1(OH)3-adsorbed vaccine where all culture supernatant fluid was not removed during the production process. No advantage was gained with oil emulsion vaccines. The degree of immunity afforded to mice and the antibody response to different serotypes of P. haemolytica varied considerably. Further detailed studies with respect to specific serotypes of P. haemolytica are therefore required.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - The resistance to anti-microbial agents of bacteria isolated from pathological conditions of birds in Victoria, 1978 to 1983.
AB  - The resistance to anti-microbial agents of bacteria isolated from pathological conditions of birds in Victoria, 1978 to 1983, was determined for isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, P. anatipestifer, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Haemophilus paragallinarum. The isolates of E. coli had a high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline and sulphonamides, and a lower prevalence of resistance to furazolidone and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The isolates of Salmonella spp commonly had resistance to tetracycline, sulphonamides, furazolidone and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Almost half the isolates of S. aureus showed resistance to lincomysin and many showed resistance to penicillin. Resistance to tetracycline was found in isolates of P. multocida, P. anatepestifer and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Some isolates of H. paragallinarum showed resistance to sulphonamides, streptomycin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
TI  - Ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  - Twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). Organisms isolated from infectious foci were Staphylococcus aureus (9), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), Streptococcus pyogenes (3), Escherichia coli (2); and Haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable H. influenzae, Group B streptococcus, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). Microbiologic cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). Fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. Neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt resolution. Seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. Bacteriologic and clinical cure rates of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. Leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. Once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.
TI  - Role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  - The etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., Pasteurella multocida. While anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. Most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. In a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. Anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. Several species of anaerobes usually were present in the wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. The anaerobes most commonly isolated included Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides disiens, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides ruminicola, Bacteroides pneumosintes, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium russii, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Veillonella species. Initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.
TI  - Pasteurella multocida pneumonia complicated by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A 71-year-old woman presented with acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. She proved to have a Pasteurella multocida pneumonia, with blood stream invasion by the organism, and required positive pressure ventilation for 53 days. Penicillin G., the drug of choice for this infection, failed to reverse the steady decline in her arterial oxygen-tension, and it was only after treatment with chloramphenicol and prednisolone that she began to improve. Serological tests strongly indicated the presence of a Staphylococcus aureus infection and the delay in giving antibiotics appropriate to this second pathogen may have been the reason for the patient's initial downhill course.
TI  - Evaluation of the microagglutination test in the diagnosis of Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection in chickens.
AB  - The sensitivity and specificity of the microagglutination (MA), serum-plate-agglutination (SP), and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test for Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) were compared in groups of chickens infected with MG, M. synoviae, or Pasteurella multocida or inoculated with bacterins prepared from Staphylococcus aureus or Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Of the three tests evaluated, the HI test had the highest specificity, but it was the least sensitive. Both the MA and SP tests were more sensitive than the HI test but lower in specificity. The MA test was less sensitive than the SP test in detecting antibodies against heterologous MG strains.
TI  - Effect of type A Pasteurella multocida fractions on bovine polymorphonuclear leukocyte functions.
AB  - The effect of various Pasteurella multocida fractions on bovine polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions was examined in vitro by using two encapsulated strains, P-2383 and P-1062 (both are Carter capsular type A and of bovine origin). The ability of PMNs to ingest Staphylococcus aureus and iodinate protein was significantly inhibited in the presence of live cells, heat-killed whole cells, or saline-extracted capsules but not in the presence of the decapsulated heat-killed cells. None of the fractions of the two strains inhibited nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by PMNs. The saline extract did not inhibit the binding of iodine to protein by a reaction involving xanthine, xanthine oxidase, and horseradish peroxidase. The PMN inhibitory factor was further characterized as a heat-stable capsular material of greater than 300,000 molecular weight.
TI  - Evaluation of a selective medium for isolation of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - Crystal violet, lincomycin, spectinomycin and bacitracin were evaluated as selective agents in media for isolation of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae. No single antimicrobial agent or combination of two or more inhibited all non-Haemophilus strains (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus equisimilis and Staphylococcus aureus) without marked suppression of 16 H. pleuropneumoniae strains. A medium containing 1 micrograms/mL of crystal violet, 1 microgram/mL of lincomycin, 8 micrograms/mL of spectinomycin and 128 micrograms/mL of bacitracin inhibited one E. coli strain and the Gram-positive strains while H. pleuropneumoniae strains were suppressed to a minor degree only. Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae was isolated on the selective medium on three occasions from the nose or pharynx of two out of eight experimentally inoculated pigs. Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae was recovered from the nose of only two pigs at necropsy and from tonsil of one, whereas the lower airways in most pigs and the lung lesions in all pigs were positive. There was no advantage to using the selective medium for the recovery of H. pleuropneumoniae at necropsy from these eight experimentally infected pigs, probably because other bacteria were absent or present in very low numbers in the tissues with H. pleuropneumoniae. The isolation rate on selective medium was higher than the rate on non-selective medium (p less than or equal to 0.1; chi 2 test) when the airways of slaughtered pigs were cultured. This was likely due to a high degree of contamination. Dry swabs placed in tryptone yeast extract with nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide gave a significantly higher recovery rate than commercial Culturette swabs in modified Stuart's transport medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Leishmania braziliensis: effects of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida) on the developing cutaneous leishmaniasis lesion in the golden hamster.
AB  - Experimentally induced lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis and the effect of concurrent bacterial infection on the development of these lesions were studied in the golden hamster. Male outbred golden hamsters received intradermal injections at the base of the tail with approximately 10(7) promastigotes of Leishmania braziliensis panamensis, or promastigotes combined with Staphylococcus aureus or Pasteurella multocida or both, bacteria only, or sterile Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEME). The size of the resulting lesions was measured at least twice each week. Hamsters were killed at postinoculation Days 6, 13, 20, 27, 41, or 48, and each lesion was measured, aseptically excised, and bisected; half was used for bacteriologic culture and the other half was prepared for light microscopic examination. Lesions resulting from L. b. panamensis alone progressed from initial erythema to a granulomatous nodule and finally to a necrotic granuloma, often capped by a crateriform ulcer. Lesions resulting from a suspension of L. b. panamensis with added S. aureus or S. aureus and P. multocida, were initially larger, more erythemic and contained a greater proportion of neutrophils up to postinoculation Days 14-21 than did lesions resulting from L. b. panamensis alone. Concurrent infections with bacteria such as S. aureus and P. multocida had little effect on the development of ulcerating characteristics of lesions, but when S. aureus was present it appeared to enhance the severity of the early lesions. Between postinoculation Days 14-28, lesions produced by L. b. panamensis, with or without added bacteria had similar developmental progression of sufficient size for optimal testing of antileishmanial compounds.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of Haemophilus somnus antibody in agglutination and complement fixation tests and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - The specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures in the detection of antibodies to Haemophilus somnus was investigated. H. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella dublin, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium pyogenes. In complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only H. agni reacted with H. somnus antisera to any significant degree. In ELISA tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two Pasteurella spp. and with H. agni. When whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in ELISAs, only H. agni showed any cross-reactivity. The greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by ELISA with saline extracts as antigens. Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus antigens failed to react with H. somnus antibody in any of the tests. A rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of P. multocida, P. haemolytica, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. dublin, C. pyogenes, and E. coli gave no positive reaction in ELISA tests with saline extract of H. somnus as antigen. It is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of H. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by ELISA of antibody response to H. somnus.
TI  - Lack of virus-specific bacterial adherence to bovine embryonic lung cells infected with bovine parainfluenza virus type 3.
AB  - Infection of bovine embryonic lung cells with bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 did not induce in vitro, virus-specific, hemadsorption-related adherence of Corynebacterium pyogenes, Haemophilus somnus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Pasteurella haemolytica, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Brucella sp., or Salmonella typhimurium.
TI  - [Intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  - Bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. The following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with diseases or died: Escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); Vibrio genitalis (3.86%); Streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); Staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); Proteus sp. (1.62%); Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); Pasteurella multocida (0.11%). The serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. Demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. The tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. There were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Preliminary clinical pharmacological investigations of tylosin and tiamulin in chickens.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of tiamulin and tylosin for mycoplasma, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative micro-organisms isolated from chickens were determinated by the agar dilution method. Median MIC values for tiamulin against Mycoplasma gallisepticum (0.05 microgram/ml) and Mycoplasma synoviae (0.10 microgram/ml) were 2 to 4 times lower than the corresponding values for tylosin. Tiamulin was also slightly more effective in vitro in inhibiting Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, and beta-haemolytic streptococci than was tylosin. Groups of chicken were offered tiamulin medicated drinking water at rates of 125 and 250 mg/litre for 48 hours. Average serum tiamulin concentrations were 0.38 and 0.78 microgram/ml, respectively. When tylosin tartrate was added to the drinking water at 500 and 700 mg/litre, average serum drug levels were 0.12 and 0.17 microgram/ml, respectively. Tiamulin was 45% bound in chicken serum, as against 30% serum protein binding for tylosin. Correlations were made between free (non protein bound) serum drug levels and the MIC values of the two drugs. Such comparisons suggest that when tiamulin is given in the drinking water at rates of 125 to 250 mg/litre, better antimycoplasmal activity is to be expected in vivo than by giving tylosin tartrate in the drinking water at 500 to 700 mg/litre. Based on these data, no clinical efficacy of these dose rates can be expected in flocks infected by gram-negative micro-organisms such as E. coli or P. multocida. The tylosin tartrate rate of 500 to 700 mg/litre, may be clinical ineffective the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections.
TI  - Preliminary clinical pharmacological investigations of tylosin and tiamulin in chickens.
AB  - Summary The minimal inhibitory concentrations (M1C) of tiamulin and tylosin for mycoplasma. Gram-positive, and Gram-negative micro-organisms isolated from chickens were determinated by the agar dilution method. Median M1C values for tiamulin against Mycoplasma gallisepticum (0.05 mug/ml) and Mycoplasma synoviae (0.10 mug/ml) were 2 to 4 times lower than the corresponding values for tylosin. Tiamulin was also slightly more effective in vitro in inhibiting Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, and beta-haemolytic streptococci than was tylosin. Groups of chicken were offered tiamulin medicated drinking water at rates of 125 and 250 mg/litre for 48 hours. Average serum tiamulin concentrations were 0.38 and 0.78 mug/ml, respectively. When tylosin tartrate was added to the drinking water at 500 and 700 mg/litre, average serum drug levels were 0.12 and 0.17 mug/ml, respectively. Tiamulin was 45% bound in chicken serum, as against 30% serum protein binding or tylosin.

Based on these data, no clinical efficacy of these dose rates can be expected in flocks infected by gram-negative microorganisms such as E. coli or P. multocida. The tylosin tartrate rate of 500 to 700 mg/litre, may be clinical ineffective the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections.
TI  - Dog bite wounds and infection: a prospective clinical study.
AB  - We prospectively studied 26 patients with 27 dog bite wounds who sought medical attention in the emergency department. Two distinct populations were found (Fishers Exact Test, P less than or equal to 0.001): 1) those who presented 8 hr to 12 hr post-injury were concerned about rabies or tetanus or surgical wound repair; and 2) those who presented more than 12 hr post-injury were concerned with infection. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in the bacteriology of the two groups. Of all wounds, 74% had aerobic pathogens isolated, including Streptococcus viridans (12 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (five strains), and Pasteurella multocida (eight strains); 41% had anaerobic pathogens isolated, including Bacteriodes species (five strains) and Fusobacterium species (five strains). Gram stains made from wound swabs were specific but insensitive predictor for bacterial growth. Empiric outpatient therapy with oral penicillin (17 patients) and/or dicloxacillin (four patients) was effective.
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in common dog bite wounds: a controlled study.
AB  - A double-blind prospective study of 98 patients was carried out, but 57 (58%) returned for follow-up and form the basis of this report. Wound irrigation and debridement were found to be important in reducing infection. Hand wounds were most likely to become infected; face and scalp wounds were at low risk. Puncture wounds became infected more often than did lacerations. Suturing wounds did not increase the likelihood of infection except on the hand, where the data were equivocal. Prophylactic penicillin decreased the incidence of infection in high-risk wounds; there was no difference in low-risk wounds. Cultures of wounds showed many different organisms but were of no predictive value. Pasteurella multocida was found very rarely. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 10% of all infections, a finding which makes use of a penicillinase-resistant penicillin logical.
TI  - Mammalian bite wounds.
AB  - Clinical data were collected prospectively from a series of 160 patients presenting with mammalian bite wounds. Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were prepared from sterile swabs placed in 65 bite wounds prior to cleansing. Infection was noted in 11 of 22 cat bites, six of 37 human bites, three of 80 dog bites, and in none of the 21 bites caused by other mammals. Pasteurella multocida was recovered from six infected cat and dog bites, all of which developed infection within 24 hours of injury. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were the principal pathogens isolated from the remaining infected cat, dog, and human bites. Infection most commonly followed puncture wounds caused by cats (10/19) and lacerations into subcutaneous tissue of the hand caused by humans (4/17). None of the 10 sutured wounds became infected. All infected bite wounds responded to antibiotic therapy. No conclusions regarding the value of prophylactic antibiotics could be made.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  - Oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. The most frequently isolated microorganisms included: IIj, EF-4, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacteria, Neisseria sp., Moraxella sp., and Bacillus sp. Other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. The high incidence of IIj, EF-4, P. multocida, and S. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
TI  - An outbreak of erysipelas in Coturnix quails.
AB  - A severe outbreak of erysipelas causing high mortality was observed in Coturnix breeder quails. Possible source(s) of erysipelothrix infection in the flock and subsequent infections due to Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus are discussed.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Corynebacterium parvum and Pasteurella multocida pretreatment on staphylococcal synovitis in turkeys.
AB  - Corynebacterium parvum and Pasteurella multocida were shown to be immunostimulants in turkeys, increasing the ability of whole blood to kill Staphylococcus aureus and prolonging the incubation time of experimental staphylococcal synovitis.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - Diverse effects of bursectomy on humoral immune responses in the chicken.
AB  - Chickens bursectomized hormonally or surgically at various ages in embryonic to postembryonic lives were immunized with a mixture of antigens, and the antibodies produced titrated. immune responses to Salmonella pullorum (SP), Brucella abortus (BA). Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) and ovalbumin (OA) were more markedly suppressed by the bursal deprivation than those to heterogenous erythrocytes, viruses and such bacteria as Pasteurella multocida (PM) and Escherichia coli B. The immune response to bovine serum albumin (BSA) was on a level between the two groups. Hormonal bursectomy in embryonic life permitted chickens immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) to produce antibody of the IgM type but not of the IgG type. In surgically bursectomized chickens IgG but not IgM production was inhibited. Chickens hormonally bursectomized on the third day of egg incubation produced IgM to a level higher than the normal chickens in contrast with the suppressed IgG production. Such diversity in the bursal influences on antibody responses was discussed in relation to ontogeny of the humoral immune system.
TI  - A direct fluorescent antibody test for identification of group E streptococci.
AB  - A rapid and specific direct fluorescent antibody test was developed for the identification of group E Streptococci (GES). Tests for specificity included an inhibition test and application of the conjugate to smears of Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, and streptococci of Lancefield's groups, A, B, C, D, E (types I, IV and untypeable), F and G. With the inhibition test, a specific blocking reaction occurred and the conjugate cross-reacted only with group C Streptococci (GCS). Adsorption with GCS eliminated the cross-reaction and rendered the conjugate specific for GES.
TI  - Carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  - Carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. Although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in Brain Heart Infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. With an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. Against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by E. coli, P. vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.
TI  - Immunogenicity of R factor-carrying Salmonella.
AB  - An increased frequency of rough cultures with associated reductions in mouse virulence was detected after R-factor transmission into strains of Salmonella choleraesuis var. kunzendorf and S. typhimurium. All rough strains tested, with or without R factors, conferred protective immunity against challenge with homologous or heterologous species of Salmonella, some of which contained R factors. Although slight protection was afforded against challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, the immunity was specific to the extent that immunized mice were fully susceptible to infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens in monkeys.
AB  - Respiratory disease in a dynamic colony of nonhuman primates during a 4-year period was due primarily to infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus influenzae. The principal secondary invaders were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci. A high fatality rate was associated with infections caused by each of the primary pathogens, and females appeared to be more susceptible than males. Incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the fall and early winter; however, at all times newly colonized monkeys had a higher infection rate than conditioned monkeys. Infections were occasionally confined only to the lungs and were sometimes present without grossly observable lung lesions. The information given on susceptibility of 10 species of nonhuman primates to respiratory infections provides a basis for developing disease models.
TI  - Production of Antibody in Mammary Gland of Pregnant, Non-Lactating and Lactating  Cows, Evoked by Polyvalent Antigen with Reference to Dosage and Frequency of Immunization.
AB  - Sixteen cows were used in a series of experiments to test dose, route and frequency responses in the production of milk and serum agglutinins to a spectrum of 9 proven bovine pathogens. The bacterial species were: Pasteurella multocida (2 isolates), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus sp., Corynebacterium sp., Salmonella enteriditis, and Aerobacter aerogenes. Primary immunizations were made either through the teat canal or intramuscularly. "Booster" injections were made through the teat canal. Agglutinins in the blood appeared only after a week or more. In the milk, titers were recorded in 1 or 2 days following primary immunization. Variation of titer in the blood and milk was somewhat independent. In all but 1 cow, antibody was produced against each organism in milk and blood serum. Udder inflammation was observed in the experiments when a 15-day interval separated immunizations. Inflammation was minimal in the experiments employing the 7-day interval of immunization. A positive Whiteside test was observed following most injections, even where no other clinical signs of reaction were seen. The findings are discussed in relation to the previous literature.
