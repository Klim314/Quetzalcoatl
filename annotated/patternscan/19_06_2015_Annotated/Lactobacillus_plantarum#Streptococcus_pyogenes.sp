TI  == organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == pyruvate kinase (pyk) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under  anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of pyk in their metabolism. these organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. they include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the  human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. in contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of pyk by inorganic phosphate, the activation of pyk shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. system-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. these require knowledge of the identities of the  enzyme modifiers. here, we predict potential allosteric activators of pyks from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. we used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of pyk. specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. we then  made a kinetic model of lactococcus lactis pyk to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. this strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the enterococcus faecalis pyk, and to predict that the pyks from streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. these differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. the combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum reduces streptococcus pyogenes virulence by modulating the il-17, il-23 and toll-like receptor 2/4 expressions in human epithelial cells.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common colonizer of the mucosal layers in the mouth,  nose, and pharynx but it is also a major gram-positive human pathogen that causes infections ranging from pharyngitis to severe systemic diseases. the lactobacilli colonize the oral tracts and are known to protect against colonization by many pathogens. epithelial cells participate in the innate host defense by expressing  a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and tlrs in the interaction with microorganisms. the potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus plantarum was investigated for its capacity to influence the innate immune response of hep-2 and a549 epithelial cells to s. pyogenes infection. in both epithelial cell types, pre-treatment with l. plantarum showed inhibition of s. pyogenes growth and a greater decrease in il-17 and il-23 levels compared to the control. pre-treatment with the anti-tlr2/4 antibody abolished the inhibitory effects of l. plantarum on il-17 and il-23 production following s. pyogenes infection, indicating that l. plantarum downregulates tlr2/4-dependent il-17 and il-23 production. overall, our findings suggest that in epithelial cell cultures with s. pyogenes, cytokine responses are modulated by the presence of l. plantarum through the induction of tlr2/tlr4.

TI  == regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (ldhs) in lactic acid bacteria (lab) display differences in their  regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), phosphate (pi), and ionic strength (nacl concentration) on six ldhs from four labs studied at ph 6 and ph 7. we found that 1) the extent of activation by fbp (kact) differs. lactobacillus plantarum ldh is not regulated by fbp, but the other ldhs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: enterococcus faecalis ldh2 </= lactococcus lactis ldh2 < e. faecalis ldh1 < l. lactis ldh1 </= streptococcus pyogenes ldh. this trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the ldh enzymes. 2) for l. plantarum, s. pyogenes, and e. faecalis, the effects of pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding nacl. 3) addition of pi inhibits e. faecalis ldh2, whereas in the absence  of fbp, pi is an activator of s. pyogenes ldh, e. faecalis ldh1, and l. lactis ldh1 and ldh2 at ph 6. these effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to ph 6 and ph 7. overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of pi, fbp, and ph that results in different regulatory effects on the ldhs of different labs.

TI  == structure of plantaricin locus of lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3 is a strain which is well known on the russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. the strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. l. plantarum 8p-a3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. dna sequence analysis of l. plantarum 8p-a3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins ef and  nc8. the plantaricin locus found in l. plantarum 8p-a3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum j51.

TI  == the abi proteins and their involvement in bacteriocin self-immunity.
AB  == the abi protein family consists of putative membrane-bound metalloproteases. while they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. in some known bacteriocin loci, abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes (e.g., pln locus from lactobacillus plantarum and sag locus from streptococcus pyogenes), where they probably are involved in self-immunity. by modifying the profile hidden markov model used to select abi proteins in the pfam protein family database, we  show that this family is larger than presently recognized. using bacteriocin-associated abi genes as a means to search for novel bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like loci were identified in gram-positive bacteria. one such locus, from lactobacillus sakei 23k, was selected for further experimental study, and it was confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (skkab) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated abi gene (skki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. similar investigation of the abi gene plni and the abi-like gene plnl from l. plantarum also confirmed their involvement in immunity to their cognate bacteriocins (plnef and plnjk, respectively). interestingly, the immunity genes from these three systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of skki, and to our knowledge, this represents a new concept in self-immunity.

TI  == [regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == we searched for new members of the tnra and glnr regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. we identified the regulatory  signals for these transcription factors with consensuses atgtnawwwwwwwtnacat for  glnr and tgtnawwwwwwwtnaca for tnra. we described the structure and found new potential members for the tnra/glnr regulons in bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, geobacillus kaustophilus, oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the tnra regulon in b. halodurans and for the glnr regulons in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. mutans, s. agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus  and st. epidermidis.

TI  == cell-surface display of e7 antigen from human papillomavirus type-16 in lactococcus lactis and in lactobacillus plantarum using a new cell-wall anchor from lactobacilli.
AB  == the human papillomavirus type-16 (hpv-16) e7 protein is considered a major viral  oncoprotein involved in cervical cancer (cxca) and a potential candidate for the  development of a vaccine against this neoplasia. here, two lactic acid bacteria (the model one lactococcus lactis and a probiotic one lactobacillus plantarum) were engineered to deliver an e7 mutant protein (e7mm), which has a reduced transforming activity and consequently, could fit better to therapeutic use in humans than the native form of e7. an efficient cell-surface display of e7mm was  obtained in l. lactis using an expression cassette encoding a precursor composed  of (i) the signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature part of the  lactococcal usp45 protein; (ii) e7mm and (iii) the cell-wall anchor of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein (cwa(m6)). this hybrid precursor was produced but not cell-wall anchored in lb. plantarum. we thus replaced cwa(m6) by the cell-wall anchor of a lb. plantarum protein which allows an efficient cell-wall anchoring of e7mm in this bacterium. the e7mm production and cell-surface display in both l. lactis and a probiotic bacterium, lb. plantarum, represent one more step towards the development of a safe and effective treatment against cxca.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == the prophage sequences of lactobacillus plantarum strain wcfs1.
AB  == the lactobacillus plantarum commensal wcfs1 contains four prophage elements in its genome. lp1 and lp2 are two about 40-kb-long uninducible prophages that share closely related dna packaging, head and tail genes defining a second lineage of pac-site siphoviridae in l. plantarum, distinct from l. plantarum phage phig1e, but related to bacillus phage spp1 and lactococcus phage tp901-1. northern analysis revealed transcribed prophage genes exclusively near both attachment sites. comparative genomics identified candidate lysogenic conversion genes (lcg) downstream of the lysis cassette and within the lysogeny module. notable are genes with sequence similarities to putative lcg from streptococcus pyogenes prophages and to a bacillus plasmid. both prophages harbored trna genes. r-lp3 and r-lp4 represent short prophage remnants; r-lp3 abuts lp2 and displays sequence links to cos-site siphoviridae.

TI  == production of cholera toxin b subunit in lactobacillus.
AB  == the intracellular expression of the b subunit of cholera toxin (ctb) was first achieved in lactobacillus paracasei lbtgs1.4 with an expression cassette including the p25 promoter of streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed l. pentosus d-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhd). secretion of ctb was next attempted in l. paracasei lbtgs1.4 and l. plantarum ncimb8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (lactococcus lactis usp45 and prtp, enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and s. pyogenes m6 protein). host-dependent secretion of ctb was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable ctb in the extracellular fraction of l. paracasei lbtgs1.4, secretion of ctb molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in l. plantarum ncimb8826.

TI  == efficient secretion of the model antigen m6-gp41e in lactobacillus plantarum ncimb 8826.
AB  == four lactobacillus strains (lb. plantarum ncimb 8826, lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4, lb. casei atcc 393 and lb. fermentum kld) were tested for their ability to produce and secrete heterologous proteins. these strains were first screened with an alpha-amylase reporter under the control of a set of expression or expression/secretion signals from various lactic acid bacteria. with most of the  constructions tested, the level of extracellular production was highest in lb. plantarum ncimb 8826, and lowest in lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4. these two strains were next assayed using a model antigen consisting of the n-terminal part of the  m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes fused to the linear epitope eldkwas from human immunodeficiency virus gp41 protein. secretion of this heterologous protein was inefficient in lb. paracasei lbtgs1.4, which accumulated a large intracellular pool of the unprocessed precursor, whereas lb. plantarum ncimb 8826 was able to secrete the antigen to a level as high as 10 mg l-1.

TI  == activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  == cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group a type of schleifer and kandler's classification, with one exception (arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. the complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group b type peptidoglycan, except those of corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group a type peptidoglycan. preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (seps), which was prepared from staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. a peptidoglycan "monomer," seps-m, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of seps with endo-n-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. in conformity with this finding, neither synthetic n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp) nor mdp-l-lys-d-ala activated the complement cascade. among several lipophilic derivatives of mdp, 6-o-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp-l-lys-d-ala (bh48-mdp-l-lys-d-ala) and  6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdp (b30-mdp) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through  the classical pathway, respectively. the finding that a d-isoasparagine analog of b30-mdp caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the  activation of complement by b30-mdp is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.

TI  == acute joint inflammation in mice after systemic injection of the cell wall, its peptidoglycan, and chemically defined peptidoglycan subunits from various bacteria.
AB  == the systemic injection of an aqueous suspension of cell wall or its peptidoglycan (pg)-rich sonicate derived from group a streptococcus and lactobacillus casei induced acute joint lesions in balb/c, dba/1j, (balb/c x dba/1j)f1, and c3h/he mouse strains, but not in c57bl/6, dba/2, and akr strains. cell walls and their enzymatically degraded pg fragments from other bacteria as well as the synthetic  disaccharide dipeptide and lactobacillus plantarum cell wall-derived disaccharide tripeptide produced similar acute inflammation in susceptible balb/c mice. acute  swelling and erythema of the ankles and wrists were observed as early as 3 h, reached maximum severity by day 2, and generally subsided by days 4 to 6 after injection. histological studies showed synovial proliferation, marked infiltration of many mononuclear cells and a few polymorphonuclear leukocytes in  the soft tissues, and extensive deposition of fibrinous exudate in the joint space. antibody response was detectable against the pg fraction. however, anti-pg antibody does not seem to be responsible for the pathogenesis of this disease. on the other hand, experiments on decomplementation by cobra venom factor suggest that complement components are involved in the early phase of this arthritic model.

TI  == contractile effects of bacterial cell walls, their enzymatic digests, and muramyl dipeptides on ileal strips from guinea pigs.
AB  == cell walls isolated from four bacterial species (streptococcus pyogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, streptomyces gardneri, and nocardia corynebacteriodes),  which exhibited the adjuvant effect of stimulating cellular and humoral immune responses against ovalbumin in guinea pigs, caused the slow-starting and long-lasting contraction of guinea pig ileal strips suspended in tyrode solution. in contrast to these cell walls active in immunoadjuvancy, those isolated from five bacterial species (micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, arthrobacter atrocyaneus, corynebacterium insidiosum, and ampullariella regularis), which lacked immunoadjuvancy at least in intact walls, caused no or very weak contraction of the ileal strips. further study demonstrated that both a monomer and a polymer of disaccharide-stem peptides, which were obtained by enzymatic degradation of s. epidermis cell wall peptidoglycans, displayed similar contractile effects. it was finally revealed that guinea pig ileum strips showed  a definite contractile response to n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine (mdp)  and 6-o-stearoyl- and 6-o-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-mdps, but not to their analogs, whose c-terminal amino acid was l-isoglutamine or d-isoasparagine in place of d-isoglutamine and which lacked adjuvancy. 6-o-(3-hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl)-mdp, on the other hand, caused a slow and lasting relaxation of the ileum strips, but its l-isoglutamine and d-isoasparagine analogs did not.

TI  == inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
AB  == streightoff, frank (the lilly research laboratories, indianapolis, ind.). inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. j. bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-fna) have been demonstrated to inhibit streptococcus sp. (viridans group), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus  plantarum in vitro. the most active compounds were 5-fna and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-fnam). the growth of streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-fna or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-fnam. the inhibition of streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. the inhibition of e. coli from 100 parts of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. inhibitions by most other active compounds  could be reversed by nicotinic acid. in experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-fna had activity against streptococcus pyogenes; 5-fna, 5-fnam, and  5-fluoro-n-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. the action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-fna was  reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. the activity of 5-fna was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.
