TI  == production of a low calorie mandarin juice by enzymatic conversion of constituent sugars to oligosaccharides and prevention of insoluble glucan formation.
AB  == over 99% of sucrose in mandarin juice (57.1 g/l in original juice to 428.4 g/l in concentrated juice) was enzymatically converted to glucooligosaccharides using 3  u dextransucrase/ml prepared from leuconostoc mesenteroides at 28 degrees c. the  oligosaccharide synthesis yields were 51 and 47% for the original and the concentrated mandarin juice, respectively. the degree of polymerization of oligosaccharides in the enzyme-modified juice was 2-7. calories in the original and modified mandarin juice were 433 and 301 kcal/l (30.5% reduction). compared with the original juice, the enzyme-modified juice showed 82% decrease of insoluble glucan formation by mutansucrase from streptococcus mutans. a sensory evaluation of the juices revealed that the original and modified mandarin juices  had sweetness values of 4.5 and 4.9 and the same values for overall acceptability.

TI  == transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylases toward different classes of acceptors.
AB  == in this study, the transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylase (sp) enzymes has been compared using eighty putative acceptors from different structural classes. to increase the solubility of hydrophobic acceptors, the addition of various co-solvents was first evaluated. all enzymes were found to retain at least 50% of their activity in 25% dimethylsulfoxide, with the enzymes  from bifidobacterium adolescentis and streptococcus mutans being the most stable. screening of the enzymes' specificity then revealed that the vast majority of acceptors are transglucosylated very slowly by sp, at a rate that is comparable to the contaminating hydrolytic reaction. the enzyme from s. mutans displayed the narrowest acceptor specificity and the one from leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b1355 the broadest. however, high activity could only be detected on l-sorbose and l-arabinose, besides the native acceptors d-fructose and phosphate. improving the affinity for alternative acceptors by means of enzyme engineering will, therefore, be a major challenge for the commercial exploitation of the transglucosylation potential of sucrose phosphorylase.

TI  == effect of leuconostoc spp. on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == insoluble glucans synthesized by streptococcus mutans enhance the pathogenicity of oral biofilm by promoting the adherence and accumulation of cariogenic bacteria on the surface of the tooth. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of leuconostoc spp. on the in vitro formation of s. mutans biofilm. three strains, leuconostoc gelidum atcc 49366, leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris atcc 19254 and leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides atcc 8293, were used in this study. they exhibited profound inhibitory effects on the  formation of s. mutans biofilm and on the proliferation of s. mutans. the water-soluble polymers produced from sucrose were most strongly produced by l. gelidum, followed by l. mesenteroides ssp. cremoris and l. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides. the mean wet weights of the artificial biofilm of s. mutans were also significantly reduced as a result of the addition of the water-soluble polymers obtained from leuconostoc cultures. according to the results of thin-layer chromatographic analysis, the hydrolysates of the water-soluble polymers produced by leuconostoc were identical to those of dextran t-2000, forming predominately alpha-(1-6) glucose linkages. these results indicate that dextran-producing leuconostoc strains are able to inhibit the formation of s. mutans biofilm in vitro.

TI  == novel transglucosylating reaction of sucrose phosphorylase to carboxylic compounds such as benzoic acid.
AB  == we examined the synthesis of benzoyl glucoside using the transglucosylation reaction of sucrose phosphorylase. sucrose phosphorylase from streptococcus mutans showed marked transglucosylating activity, particularly under acidic conditions. on the other hand, sucrose phosphorylase from leuconostoc mesenteroides showed very weak transglucosylating activity. three main products were detected from the reaction mixture using benzoic acid as an acceptor molecule and sucrose as a donor molecule. these compounds were identified as 1-o-benzoyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside, 2-o-benzoyl alpha-d-glucopyranose and 2-o-benzoyl beta-d-glucopyranose on the basis of their isolation and the isolation of their acetylated products and subsequent analysis using 1d- and 2d-nmr analyses. from the results of the time-course analyses of the enzyme reaction and the degradation of 1-o-benzoyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside, 1-o-benzoyl  alpha-d-glucopyranoside was considered to be initially produced by the transglucosylation reaction of the enzyme, and 2-o-benzoyl alpha-d-glucopyranose  and 2-o-benzoyl beta-d-glucopyranose were produced from 1-o-benzoyl alpha-d-glucopyranoside by intramolecular acyl migration reaction. the acceptor specificity in the glucosylation reaction of s. mutans sucrose phosphorylase was  also investigated. this sucrose phosphorylase could transglucosylate toward various carboxylic compounds. short-chain fatty acids, hydroxy acids and dicarboxylic acids were also glucosylated with this sucrose phosphorylase.

TI  == conserved repeat motifs and glucan binding by glucansucrases of oral streptococci and leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  == glucansucrases of oral streptococci and leuconostoc mesenteroides have a common pattern of structural organization and characteristically contain a domain with a series of tandem amino acid repeats in which certain residues are highly conserved, particularly aromatic amino acids and glycine. in some glucosyltransferases (gtfs) the repeat region has been identified as a glucan binding domain (gbd). such gbds are also found in several glucan binding proteins (gbp) of oral streptococci that do not have glucansucrase activity. alignment of  the amino acid sequences of 20 glucansucrases and gbp showed the widespread conservation of the 33-residue a repeat first identified in gtfi of streptococcus downei. site-directed mutagenesis of individual highly conserved residues in recombinant gbd of gtfi demonstrated the importance of the first tryptophan and the tyrosine-phenylalanine pair in the binding of dextran, as well as the essential contribution of a basic residue (arginine or lysine). a microplate binding assay was developed to measure the binding affinity of recombinant gbds.  gbd of gtfi was shown to be capable of binding glucans with predominantly alpha-1,3 or alpha-1,6 links, as well as alternating alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 links (alternan). western blot experiments using biotinylated dextran or alternan as probes demonstrated a difference between the binding of streptococcal gtf and  gbp and that of leuconostoc glucansucrases. experimental data and bioinformatics  analysis showed that the a repeat motif is distinct from the 20-residue cw motif, which also has conserved aromatic amino acids and glycine and which occurs in the choline-binding proteins of streptococcus pneumoniae and other organisms.

TI  == modified oligosaccharides as potential dental plaque control materials.
AB  == metabolic acids produced by oral pathogens demineralize tooth surfaces, leading to dental caries. glucosyltransferases are the key factor in this process. we synthesized various modified oligosaccharides and tested them for their inhibitory effects on glucosyltransferase activity. oligosaccharides were produced using a mixed-culture fermentation of lipomyces starkeyi and leuconostoc mesenteroides and then further modified as iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides. iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides reduced glucosyltransferase activity of streptococci from 17% to 43% and prevented the formation of insoluble biomass on  the surface of glass vials or stainless steel wires in the presence of sucrose. they also reduced the growth and acid productions of oral pathogens including s.  mutans, s. sobrinus, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcmitans.

TI  == effect of carbohydrate fatty acid esters on streptococcus sobrinus and glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == mutans streptococci are oral bacteria with a key role in the initiation of dental caries, because their glucosyltransferases synthesize polysaccharides from sucrose that allow them to colonize the tooth surface. among the strategies to prevent dental caries that are being investigated are (1) the inhibition of bacterial growth of mutans streptococci or (2) the inhibition of glucosyltransferases involved in polysaccharide formation. pure fatty acid esters of sucrose, maltose and maltotriose were synthesized by an enzyme-catalyzed process and tested as inhibitors of two glucosyltransferases of great homology, those from streptococcus sobrinus and leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b-512f. in spite of having their nonreducing end glucose blocked at 6-oh, they did not inhibit dextran synthesis. however, their effect on the growth of s. sobrinus in  the solid and liquid phase was notable. 6-o-lauroylsucrose, 6'-o-lauroylmaltose and 6"-o-lauroylmaltotriose at 100 microg/ml showed complete inhibition of s. sobrinus in agar plates. consequently, these nontoxic derivatives are very promising for inclusion in oral-hygiene products aimed at disrupting plaque formation and preventing caries.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of foodborne paenibacillus and bacillus spp. against clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the saprophytic paenibacillus and bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. culture supernatants of 200 strains of paenibacillus and bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against c.  botulinum type a, proteolytic type b, and type e strains in a well diffusion assay. nineteen strains were positive against c. botulinum. among those, seven paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the  largest antimicrobial spectrum against c. botulinum strains. the antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive p. polymyxa strains. the antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees c and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees c in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. in co-cultures with the positive strain of p. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a c. botulinum type e strain was inhibited whenever p. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before c. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. the antimicrobial activity of p. polymyxa against c. botulinum was attributed to the  production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to  these antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == assessment of acid production by various human oral micro-organisms when palatinose or leucrose is utilized.
AB  == one promising way of reducing caries is by using sucrose substitutes in food, e.g., palatinose or leucrose. previous experiments addressing cariogenic potential of sucrose substitutes have focused mainly on streptococcus mutans. however, given the many other micro-organisms in the oral cavity, this study compared the acid production of 100 bacterial strains representing 44 different species, by batch fermentation in a test tube containing, as a sole carbohydrate  source, glucose, sucrose, palatinose, or leucrose. selected strains were further  analyzed in a fermenter. additionally, 30 yeast strains were tested by an auxanographic sugar assimilation test. only lactobacillus spp., stomatococcus mucilaginosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella paramesenteroides, and some of the yeasts studied-i.e., candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae-utilized leucrose and/or palatinose well. strikingly, stomatococcus mucilaginosus produced water-insoluble polysaccharides by fermentation of leucrose and palatinose. in the fermenter, the respective sucrose substitutes were not only cleaved but also utilized. thus, extracellular cleavage by autochthonous micro-organisms may produce cariogenic cleavage products (glucose, fructose) that can be used by other well-characterized cariogenic bacteria found in the oral flora. therefore, the anticariogenic potential of sucrose substitutes in food might be limited.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  == a rosemary extract commercially exploited (oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. for gram-positive bacteria, the mic of the ethanolic solution was 1% for leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for bacillus cereus. it slowed the growth of penicillium roquefortii and botrytis cinerea. up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts rhodotorula glutinis and cryptococcus laurentii. antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. the mic was reduced by low ph, high nacl contents, and  low temperatures. low ph and high nacl concentration had a synergistic effect on  the mic of the rosemary extract for s. aureus. lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. the inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees c). the  natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. the antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.

TI  == glucan binding regions of dextransucrase from leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b-512f.
AB  == we isolated glucan-binding peptides of a dextransucrase from leuconostoc mesenteroides b-512f. the dextransucrase was bound to deae-sephadex a-50, sephadex g-100, and mutan from streptococcus mutans. mild trypsin digestion dissociated the enzyme and glucan binding. in the presence of ammonium sulfate, several peptides were bound to glucan after trypsin digestion. four main mutan-binding peptides were obtained by this method, and those amino acid sequences were analyzed. one of them was identical with the dextran-binding peptide that contains lysine, which was previously isolated by differential chemical modification with o-phthalaldehyde. we also found mutan-binding peptides in sucrose- and dextran-binding regions and a lysine-rich region. also, there was a peptide similar in sequence to glucan-binding a-repeat of streptococcal glucosyltransferases.

TI  == natural instability of agrobacterium vitis ti plasmid due to unusual duplication  of a 2.3-kb dna fragment.
AB  == the octopine/cucumopine (o/c) ti plasmids of agrobacterium vitis carry two t regions, ta and tb. the ta region resembles the octopine tl region. the tb region contains the auxin synthesis genes tb-iaam and tb-iaah and the cucumopine synthesis gene cus. within the group of o/c isolates, strains 2608 and 2641 are closely related. however, 2641 lacks the tb region. the restriction maps of pti2608 and pti2641 were established and showed that the tb deletion resulted from intramolecular recombination between two directly repeated sequences separated by 66 kb in pti2608. the 2,294-bp repeated sequence lacks inverted repeats and does not duplicate its target site, indicating that it is not a classical bacterial insertion sequence (is element). it was therefore called an rsav element (repeated sequence of a. vitis). the rsav element carries two open reading frames: orf234 is homologous to the trar gene of the a. tumefaciens nopaline ti plasmid ptic58; orf488 is homologous to the sucrose phosphorylase gene of leuconostoc mesenteroides and the glucosyl transferase a gene of streptococcus mutans. the rsav repeat starts precisely at the start codon of orf488 and ends two base pairs 3' of the stop codon of orf234. the structural organization of the rsav element suggests that the amplification event did not result from a random amplification process. a study of the distribution of the two rsav copies (rsav-1 and rsav-2) in pti2608 and other o/c isolates indicates that the ancestor o/c ti plasmid contained only rsav-1 and that this sequence was duplicated at one point during the divergent evolution of the o/c ti plasmids.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an active-site peptide containing the second essential carboxyl group of dextransucrase from leuconostoc mesenteroides by chemical modifications.
AB  == the treatment of leuconostoc mesenteroides b-512f dextransucrase with 10 mm 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (edc) and glycine ethyl ester (gee) inactivated the enzyme almost completely within 24 min where the modification of one carboxyl group/mol of the enzyme by edc was attained. though  30 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate (dep) also inactivated the enzyme, about 35% of the activity remained during a 36-min incubation. when 10 mol of imidazole residues/mol of the enzyme was modified by dep, 50% of the activity was still retained. the addition of the substrate sucrose greatly retarded the enzyme inactivation by edc. however, the addition of dextran slightly protected the inactivation of the glucosyl-transferring activity and accelerated the inactivation of the sucrose-cleaving activity. in the case of dep, the addition of sucrose or dextran gave no influence on the inactivation of the enzyme. therefore, the carboxyl group seemed to play a more important role in the substrate binding and in the catalytic activity of the dextransucrase than the imidazolium group. differential labeling of leuconostoc dextransucrase by edc was conducted in the presence of a sucrose analog, sucrose monocaprate. the fluorescent probe n-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (edan) was used as the nucleophile instead of gee. a fluorescent labeled peptide was isolated from a trypsin digest of the edc-edan modified enzyme. the amino acid sequence of the isolated peptide was leu-gln-glu-asp-asn-ser-asn-val-val-val-glu-ala.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == maltodextrin acceptor reactions of streptococcus mutans 6715 glucosyltransferases.
AB  == the maltodextrin (maltose through maltoheptaose) acceptor reactions of two streptococcus mutans 6715 glucosyltransferases (gtf-i and gtf-s) were studied. the acceptor product structures were determined by comparing them with the known  structures of the acceptor products of leuconostoc mesenteroides b-512fm dextransucrase (ec 2.4.1.5) and l. mesenteroides b-1355 alternansucrase (ec 2.4.1.140). when reacted with maltose (g2), both gtf-i and gtf-s transferred a d-glucopyranose from sucrose to the nonreducing glucosyl residue to give panose (6(2)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl maltose). panose then served as an acceptor to give  two further acceptor products, 6(2)-alpha-isomaltosyl maltose and 6(2)-alpha-nigerosyl maltose. 6(2)-alpha-isomaltosyl maltose then went on to serve as an acceptor to give a series of homologous acceptor products with isomaltodextrin chains attached to c-6 of the nonreducing-end residue of maltose, while 6(2)-alpha-nigerosyl maltose did not further react. when reacted with other maltodextrins (g3-g7), both gtf-i and gtf-s transferred a d-glucopyranose to c-6  of either the nonreducing-end or the reducing-end residues of the maltodextrins,  forming alpha(1----6) linkages. when d-glucopyranose was transferred to the nonreducing-end residue by gtf-i or gtf-s, the first product was also an acceptor to give the second product, which then served as an acceptor to give the third product, etc., to give a homologous series of products. when d-glucopyranose was  transferred to the reducing-end residue, the acceptor product that formed did not readily serve as an acceptor, or served only as a very poor acceptor, to give a small amount of the next homologue, as was the case for g7 with gtf-s. in addition, gtf-i also transferred d-glucopyranose to the reducing-end or to the nonreducing-end residue of maltotriose, forming alpha(1----3) linkages, to give 3(3)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl maltotriose and 3(1)-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl maltotriose. neither of these acceptor products further served as acceptors to give a homologous series. under equivalent conditions of equimolar amounts of acceptor and sucrose, maltose and maltotriose are much better acceptors with gtf-i than they are with gtf-s, which is better than l. mesenteroides b-512fm dextransucrase. the three enzymes display significantly different efficiencies for the different maltodextrin acceptor reactions, gtf-i and gtf-s having much higher efficiencies than l. mesenteroides b-512fm dextransucrase.

TI  == purification and some properties of sucrose phosphorylase from leuconostoc mesenteroides.
AB  == sucrose phosphorylase (ec 2.4.1.7) was purified to homogeneity from leuconostoc mesenteroides cells with a specific activity of 173.8 units per mg protein by ammonium sulfate fractionation, anion exchange hplc on tskgel deae-5pw, and hydrophobic hplc on tskgel ether-5pw. the purified enzyme was an acidic protein having an isoelectric point of ph 4.6 and s0(20),w of 4.34s. the molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated to be 56,400 by sedimentation equilibrium, 55,000 by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and hplc gel filtration on tskgel g3000sw, suggesting that the enzyme is a monomeric protein. with regard to molecular weight, amino acid composition, and n-terminal amino acid sequence of 30 residues, this enzyme is close to the glucosyltransferase a of streptococcus mutans.

TI  == exocellular polysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the production of homopolysaccharides (dextrans, mutans) and heteropolysaccharides by lactic acid bacteria, their chemical composition, their  structure and their synthesis are outlined. mutans streptococci, which include streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus produce soluble and insoluble alpha-glucans. the latter may contain as much as 90% alpha-1-3 linkages and possess a marked ability to promote adherence to the smooth tooth surface causing dental plaque. dextrans produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides are high molecular weight alpha-glucans having 1-6, 1-4 and 1-3 linkages, varying from slightly to highly branched; 1-6 linkages are predominant. emphasis is put on exopolysaccharide producing thermophilic and mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, which are important in the dairy industry. the produced polymers play a key role in the rheological behaviour and the texture of fermented milks. one of the main problems in this field is the transitory nature of the thickening trait. this instability is not yet completely understood. controversial results exist on the sugar composition of the slime produced, but galactose and glucose have always been identified with galactose predominating in most cases.

AB  == starting from sucrose, 2,3,1',3',4',6'-hexa-o-benzoyl-6-deoxy-6-iodosucrose (1) was synthesized. reaction of 1 with sulfuryl chloride in pyridine gave 2,3,1',3',4',6'-hexa-o-benzoyl-4-chloro-4,6-dideoxy-6-iodogalactosucr ose (2). compound 2 was treated with tributyltin hydride in toluene in the presence of a radical initiator, alpha, alpha-azobis(isobutanonitrile) (aibn), to remove iodine and chlorine groups and give hexa-o-benzoyl-4,6-dideoxysucrose. benzoyl groups were removed by sodium methoxide in methanol to give 4,6-dideoxysucrose. sucrose  was modified at carbon atom 3, carbon atom 4, or carbon atoms 4 and 6, and these  analogs were tested as inhibitors of the d-glucansucrases (d-glucosyltransferases) of streptococcus mutans 6715 and leuconostoc mesenteroides b-512f. sucrose analogs used in this study are 4-deoxysucrose and 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose with s. mutans 6715 d-glucansucrases (gtf-s and gtf-i), and 3-deoxysucrose, 4-deoxysucrose, 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose, 6-deoxysucrose, and 4,6-dideoxysucrose with l. mesenteroides b-512f d-glucansucrase. the data indicate that 3-deoxysucrose, 4-deoxysucrose, and 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose are weak noncompetitive inhibitors for b-512f dextransucrase, with ki values of 530, 201, and 202mm respectively. for the same  enzyme, 6-deoxysucrose was a strong competitive inhibitor, with ki of 1.60mm, and 4,6-dideoxysucrose was a good competitive inhibitor, with ki of 20.3mm. 4-deoxysucrose was a weak noncompetitive inhibitor for both gtf-i and gtf-s, with ki values of 672 and 608mm, respectively. 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose was also a weak noncompetitive inhibitor for gtf-i and gtf-s with ki values of 391 and 308mm, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the formation of alpha-d-(1----3) branch linkages by a d-glucansucrase from streptococcus mutans 6715 producing a soluble d-glucan.
AB  == an exocellular d- glucansucrase that synthesizes a water-soluble, alpha-d-(1----6)-linked d-glucan having a high proportion of alpha-d-(1----3) branches was purified from the culture broth of streptococcus mutans 6715. the rate of incorporation of d-[14c]glucose from [14c]sucrose into d-glucan of high molecular weight by this enzyme was increased (stimulated) by the presence of exogenous leuconostoc mesenteroides b- 512f dextran, and it was found that this dextran could act as an acceptor. a highly branched dextran, containing 45-50% of alpha-d-(1----3) branch linkages, did not stimulate the enzyme nearly so much as  b- 512f dextran, which has a low degree (5%) of alpha-d-(1----3) branches. we interpret this as evidence that the stimulating effects of dextran are not due to priming. if they were, the more highly branched dextran should have produced the  greatest stimulation per unit weight, because a much greater number of nonreducing-end, priming sites would be available. we show that the d- glucansucrase was capable of transferring d-glucosyl groups from sucrose to b- 512f dextran to form alpha-d-(1----3) branches, thereby rendering the dextran more resistant to hydrolysis by endodextranase . the presence of 1.6m ammonium sulfate caused the enzyme to synthesize a d-glucan having a much higher percentage of alpha-d-(1----3) linkages.

TI  == disproportionation reactions catalyzed by leuconostoc and streptococcus glucansucrases.
AB  == glucansucrases from leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b-512f and streptococcus mutans 6715 were found to utilize a number of d-gluco-oligosaccharides as d-glucosyl donors and as acceptors. these donors included isomaltotriose and its  homologs, panose, maltotriose, and dextran. in each case, d-glucosyl groups were  transferred from the donor to an acceptor sugar. when the donor sugar also acted  as an acceptor, disproportionation reactions occurred. isomaltotriose, for example, gave rise to isomaltose and isomaltotetraose initially, and to a series  of isomalto-oligosaccharides eventually. in addition to forming alpha-d-(1----6)  linkages in the reactions, dextransucrase from s. mutans 6715 was capable of forming alpha-d-(1----3)-linked products.

AB  == a spontaneous mutant of streptococcus mutans 6715 (serotype g) defective in dextran-induced agglutination ability was isolated. the wild type strain and its  mutant were termed as 6715-dp and 6715-dn, respectively. both strains possessed serotype g antigen, and exerted similar sugar fermentation patterns. strain 6715-dp was rapidly and strongly agglutinated upon addition of high molecular weight dextran, whereas the mutant strain 6715-dn was not. [14c]dextran prepared  from leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase and [14c]sucrose bound to fresh or  lyophilized 6715-dp cells, but not to the mutant 6715-dn cells. however, both strains adhered to a glass surface in the presence of sucrose. furthermore, heat-treated (100 degrees c, 10 min) cells of both strains bound cell-free glucosyltransferase, although dextran agglutination ability of strain 6715-dp was destroyed by this treatment, indicating that receptors for dextran and glucosyltransferase were different entities. furthermore, serotype c, e, and f strains s. mutans did not agglutinate upon addition of dextran, nor did they bind [14c]dextran. however, all these strains and both 6715-dp and 6715-dn strains induced marked dental caries in spf rats. it is concluded that dextran-induced agglutination ability is not a necessary condition for s. mutans to induce dental caries.

TI  == growth inhibition of streptococcus mutans and leuconostoc mesenteroides by sodium fluoride and ionic tin.
AB  == sodium fluoride caused inhibition of growth rate and growth levels of streptococcus mutans with glucose as the primary energy and carbon source. stannous fluoride increased growth lag nad caused a much greater inhibition of growth rate than did sodium fluoride. neither compound was found to be bactericidal when culture viability was measured after 6 days of incubation. leuconostoc mesenteroides, which lacks a phosphotransferase system for sugar transport, showed less inhibition of growth rate with both inhibitors than did s. mutans, which possesses a phosphotransferase system. metabolism of glucose or lactose which requires enolase activity shoed sodium fluoride inhibition, whereas metabolism of arginine or pyruvate does not involve enolase activity and showed no inhibition of growth.
