TI  == characterization of microbial community in the leachate associated with the decomposition of entombed pigs.
AB  == foot and mouth disease (fmd) is one of the acute infectious diseases in hoofed and even-toed mammals, including pigs, and it occurs via acute infection by aphthovirus. when fmd is suspected, animals around the location of origin are typically slaughtered and buried. other methods such as rendering, composting, and incineration have not been verified in practice in korea. after the fmd incident, the regular monitoring of the microbial community is required, as microorganisms greatly modify the characteristics of the ecosystem in which they  live. this is the result of their metabolic activities causing chemical changes to take place in the surrounding environment. in this study, we investigated changes in the microbial community during a 24 week period with dna extracts from leachate, formed by the decomposition of buried pigs at a laboratory test site, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with a genomic dna. our results revealed that bacteroides coprosuis, which is common in pig excreta, and  sporanaerobacter acetigenes, which is a sulfur-reduced microbe, were continuously observed. during the early stages (0~2 weeks) of tissue decomposition, clostridium cochlearium, fusobacterium ulcerans, and fusobacterium sp., which are involved in skin decomposition, were also observed. in addition, various microbes such as turicibacter sanguinis, clostridium haemolyticum, bacteroides propionicifaciens, and comamonas sp. were seen during the later stages (16~24 weeks). in particular, the number of existing microbial species gradually increased during the early stages, including the exponential phase, decreased during the middle stages, and then increased again during the later stages. therefore, these results indicate that the decomposition of pigs continues for a  long period of time and leachate is created continuously during this process. it  is known that leachate can easily flow into the neighboring environment, so a long-term management plan is needed in burial locations for fmd-infected animals.

TI  == bacteroides propionicifaciens sp. nov., isolated from rice-straw residue in a methanogenic reactor treating waste from cattle farms.
AB  == two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains (sv434(t) and s562) were isolated from rice-straw residue in a methanogenic reactor treating waste from cattle farms in  japan. they had identical 16s rrna gene sequences and showed almost the same phenotypic properties. the cells of both strains were gram-negative, non-motile,  non-spore-forming rods; extraordinarily long rods often occurred. remarkable stimulation of growth occurred with the addition of haemin and cobalamin (vitamin b(12)) to the medium. the supplementary cobalamin and haemin could be replaced if autoclaved and clarified sludge fluid obtained from the reactor was added. both strains utilized a range of growth substrates, including arabinose, fructose, galactose, glucose, mannose, cellobiose, maltose, glycogen, starch, dextrin, amygdalin, lactate and pyruvate. both strains produced acetate and propionate with a small amount of succinate from these substrates in the presence of haemin  and cobalamin. both strains were slightly alkaliphilic, having a ph optimum at about 7.9. the temperature range for growth was 5-35 degrees c, the optimum being 30 degrees c. the nacl concentration range for growth was 0-4 % (w/v). catalase activity was not detected in cells cultivated without haemin, whereas cells cultivated with haemin usually had the enzyme activity. oxidase and nitrate-reducing activities were not detected. aesculin was hydrolysed, but gelatin was not hydrolysed. both strains were sensitive to bile acids. the major  cellular fatty acids of both strains were anteiso-c(15 : 0) and iso-c(15 : 0). menaquinones mk-8(h(0)) and mk-9(h(0)) were the major respiratory quinones and the genomic dna g+c contents were 46.2-47.5 mol%. a phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences placed both strains in the phylum bacteroidetes. bacteroides coprosuis (isolated from swine-manure storage pits) was the species most closely related to both strains (95.9 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to the type strain). on the basis of the phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic analyses, strains sv434(t) and s562 represent a novel species of the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides propionicifaciens sp. nov.  is proposed. the type strain is sv434(t) (=jcm 14649(t) =dsm 19291(t)).

TI  == bacteroides coprosuis sp. nov., isolated from swine-manure storage pits.
AB  == two gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped organisms were isolated from a swine-manure storage pit. based on morphological and biochemical  criteria, the strains were tentatively identified as belonging to the genus bacteroides but they did not appear to correspond to any recognized species of the genus. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies showed that the strains were related closely to each other and confirmed their placement in the genus bacteroides, but sequence divergence values of >10 % from reference bacteroides species demonstrated that the organisms from manure represent a novel species. based on biochemical criteria and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown isolates from manure be assigned to a novel species of the genus bacteroides, as bacteroides coprosuis sp. nov. the type strain is pc139t (=ccug 50528t=nrrl b-41113t).
