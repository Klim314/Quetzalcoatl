TI  - Localization and functional properties of two galectin-1 proteins in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) mucosal tissues.
AB  - Galectin-1 is a beta-galactoside binding lectin with multiple immune functions in higher vertebrates. We report the characterization of two galectin-1 proteins from Atlantic cod, with emphasis on mucosal tissues. Tissue distribution of these two approximately 14kDa galectin-1 proteins (Codgal1-1 and Codgal1-2) was ascertained by western blotting of one dimensional (1D) and two dimensional (2DE) gels. The two galectin-1 proteins were differentially localized in the mucosal tissues of cod. Codgal1-1 was predominantly localized in the basal cells of skin and this protein was present in all the early developmental stages examined, indicating a likely involvement in developmental processes. The two lectins were also localized in the adherent macrophage-like cells (MLC) from cod head kidney and results gathered indicate their possible secretion during Francisella noatunensis infection, suggesting that they are active components of immune defence. Lactose affinity chromatography coupled with gel filtration co-purified the two cod galectin-1 proteins, which hemagglutinated horse red blood cells in a lactose inhibitable manner. They also could bind and agglutinate both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This study suggests multiple functional roles for galectin-1, especially in development and innate immune response of Atlantic cod.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal lysozyme-type activity in Cameraria ohridella pupae.
AB  - Lysozyme-type antibacterial and antifungal activity in pupae of Cameraria ohridella was studied. Activity against Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus megaterium was detected in pupae extract. Also antifungal activity from C. ohridella pupae extract directed against Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W 303 was shown. During immunoblotting two bands in pupae extract, with molecular mass of about 15 and 28 kDa were recognized by antibodies directed against HEWL. After acid electrophoresis followed by bioautography of the extract, two lytic zones showing lysozyme-type activity against M. luteus were observed. Two bacteria: Gram-positive Aerococcus viridans and Gram-negative Aeromonas salmonicida ssp. masoucida were isolated from pupae of C. ohridella. Their activity against M. luteus, B. megaterium, and S. cerevisiae W303 was detected. After immunoblotting with antibodies against HEWL, also two proteins from bacterial suspensions of A. viridans and A. salmonicida were detected, about 15 and 28 kDa.
TI  - Development of a specific biotinylated DNA probe for the detection of Renibacterium salmoninarum.
AB  - A specific DNA probe for the identification of Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease (BKD), was developed from one of 3 clones pRS47, pRS49, and pRS26 of 5.1 kb, 5.3 kb, and 11.3 kb, respectively. The biotinylated pRS47/BamHI insert probe was tested on 3 dilutions of DNA extracted from 3 strains of R. salmoninarum and from 1 strain each of Arthrobacter protophormiae, Aeromonas salmonicida, Corynebacterium aquaticum, Carnobacterium piscicola, Listonella anguillarum, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Vibrio ordalii, and Yersinia ruckeri. In a dot blot assay, this probe hybridized only with the DNA from the R. salmoninarum strains. When used on kidney samples from fish challenged with R. salmoninarum, the dot blot hybridization assay with the probe was found to be as sensitive as culture. In a fluorescent antibody test, samples that were negative in culture and dot blot hybridization showed no more than one fluorescing cell in 50 microscopic fields examined. This DNA probe, therefore, has the potential for use in the diagnosis of BKD of fish.
