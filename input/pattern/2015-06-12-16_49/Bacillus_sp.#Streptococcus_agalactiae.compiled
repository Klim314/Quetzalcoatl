TI  - Structural determinants in streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups.
AB  - Pathogenic Streptococcus agalactiae produces polysaccharide lyases and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL), which are prerequisite for complete degradation of mammalian extracellular matrices, including glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin and hyaluronan. Unlike the Bacillus enzyme, streptococcal UGLs prefer sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Here, we show the loop flexibility for substrate binding and structural determinants for recognition of glycosaminoglycan sulfate groups in S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL). UGL also degraded unsaturated heparin disaccharides; this indicates that the enzyme released unsaturated iduronic and glucuronic acids from substrates. We determined the crystal structures of SagUGL wild-type enzyme and both substrate-free and substrate-bound D175N mutants by x-ray crystallography and noted that the loop over the active cleft exhibits flexible motion for substrate binding. Several residues in the active cleft bind to the substrate, unsaturated chondroitin disaccharide with a sulfate group at the C-6 position of GalNAc residue. The sulfate group is hydrogen-bonded to Ser-365 and Ser-368 and close to Lys-370. As compared with wild-type enzyme, S365H, S368G, and K370I mutants exhibited higher Michaelis constants toward the substrate. The conversion of SagUGL to Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL-like enzyme via site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser-365 and Lys-370 are essential for direct binding and for electrostatic interaction, respectively, for recognition of the sulfate group by SagUGL. Molecular conversion was also achieved in SagUGL Arg-236 with an affinity for the sulfate group at the C-4 position of the GalNAc residue. These residues binding to sulfate groups are frequently conserved in pathogenic bacterial UGLs, suggesting that the motif "R-//-SXX(S)XK" (where the hyphen and slash marks in the motif indicate the presence of over 100 residues in the enzyme and parentheses indicate that Ser-368 makes little contribution to enzyme activity) is crucial for degradation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans.
TI  - Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs.
TI  - [Main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern Cameroon].
AB  - Between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of Mycoplasma (M.): M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. ovipneumoniae, M. agalactiae, M. sp. type D2 and M. arginini. Eleven Pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes A1, A3, A5, A7 and D2) and 11 Pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. Thirty-two antibiograms were performed on Pasteurella, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Actinomyces pyogenes strains. Eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin G and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. One Capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. Pest of small ruminants (PPR) virus was detected by immunocapture ELISA test performed on some lung samples. Two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats), between 1991 and 1993, and one for PPR (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the North and Far North provinces. No antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. Among the animals in the sample, PPR prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the Far North province and 14 +/- 3% in the North province. Concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated Pasteurella strains. PPR is endemic especially in the Far North province. The efficiency of a vaccination campaign against PPR must be estimated with a field survey.
