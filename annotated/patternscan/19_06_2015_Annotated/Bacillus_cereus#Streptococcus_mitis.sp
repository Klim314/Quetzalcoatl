TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == mercuric resistance genes in gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == mercury-resistant bacteria isolated from the oral cavities of children carried one of two types of mera gene that appear to have evolved from a common ancestor. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and a few other species had mera genes  that were very similar to mera of bacillus cereus strain rc607. unlike the b. cereus rc607 mera gene, however, the streptococcal mera genes were not carried on tn5084-like transposons. instead, comparisons with microbial genomic sequences suggest the mera gene is located on a novel type ii transposon. coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococcus parasanguis had identical mera genes that represent a new mera variant.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == carbon monoxide production from heme compounds by bacteria.
AB  == carbon monoxide formation from heme compounds by bacteria was investigated to study microbial hemoprotein catabolism with reference to heme degradation by mammalian tissues. hemolytic and nonhemolytic bacteria were incubated aerobically and anaerobically with the following substrates: erythrocytes, hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome c, hematin, iron hematoporphyrin, copper hematoporphyrin, protoporphyrin, and bilirubin. after 18 hr at 37 c the evolved co was measured by gas chromatography. none of the bacteria formed co anaerobically. under aerobic conditions both alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis and hemolytic bacillus cereus formed co from all of the heme compounds tested, whereas nonhemolytic streptococcus mitis did not evolve co from any of the substrates. the hemolytic bacteria did not produce co when the iron of heme was either replaced by copper or removed, as in copper hematoporphyrin and in protoporphyrin, respectively.
