TI  == triblock copolymer matrix-based capillary electrophoretic microdevice for high-resolution multiplex pathogen detection.
AB  == rapid and simple analysis for the multiple target pathogens is critical for patient management. ce-sscp analysis on a microchip provides high speed, high sensitivity, and a portable genetic analysis platform in molecular diagnostic fields. the capability of separating ssdna molecules in a capillary electrophoretic microchannel with high resolution is a critical issue to perform  the precise interpretation in the electropherogram. in this study, we explored the potential of poly(ethyleneoxide)-poly(propyleneoxide)-poly(ethyleneoxide) (peo-ppo-peo) triblock copolymer as a sieving matrix for ce-sscp analysis on a microdevice. to demonstrate the superior resolving power of peo-ppo-peo copolymers, 255-bp pcr amplicons obtained from 16s ribosomal rna genes of four bacterial species, namely proteus mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and neisseria meningitidis, were analyzed in the peo-ppo-peo matrix in comparison with 5% linear polyacrylamide and commercial genescan gel. due to enhanced dynamic coating and sieving ability, peo-ppo-peo copolymer displayed fourfold enhancement of resolving power in the ce-sscp to separate same-sized dna molecules. fivefold input of genomic dna of p. aeruginosa and/or n. meningitidis  produced proportionally increased corresponding amplicon peaks, enabling correct  quantitative analysis in the pathogen detection. besides the high-resolution sieving capability, a facile loading and replenishment of gel in the microchannel due to thermally reversible gelation property makes peo-ppo-peo triblock copolymer an excellent matrix in the ce-sscp analysis on the microdevice.

TI  == the family of serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

TI  == serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents a new type of hemolysin and has been studied in great molecular detail with regard to structure, activation and secretion. it has nothing in common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type  (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin  of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins.  the s. marcescens hemolysin proteins shlb and shla exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, edwardsiella tarda and erwinia chrysantemi. furthermore, sequence motifs present in shla and shlb have been shown to be important for activity and secretion of the s. marcescens hemolysin. thus, the s. marcescens hemolysin forms the prototype of a new class of hemolysins and of a new secretory mechanism. the uniqueness of this new mechanism is underlined by the fact that activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. new data implicate a conformational change in shla during activation. in addition, shla not only forms pores in erythrocytes but also in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. the cytotoxic action of shla is mainly determined by lysis of infected cells in vitro. in sublytic doses, as will normally be the situation in vivo, shla exerts additionally effects which are currently under investigation. the knowledge of the structure, activation, secretion and mode of action of s. marcescens hemolysin has implications for proteins, related in sequence or in mode of secretion and activation.

TI  == iron-regulated haemolysin gene from edwardsiella tarda.
AB  == we have cloned and sequenced the haemolysin gene locus from edwardsiella tarda (eth). this region encoded two open reading frames, designated etha and ethb. etha is the haemolysin gene consisting of 4782bp encoding a product of 165.3 kda  and ethb is an activation/secretion protein gene of 1677bp that encodes a product of 61.9 kda. there were two putative ferric uptake regulator (fur) binding sites  on the 5' upstream region of the ethb gene overlapping the promoter region and ribosome-binding site. the haemolysin produced by the cloned gene was secreted by escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequences of the etha and ethb genes were found to be homologous to those of the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of haemophilus ducreyi, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens. e. coli carrying the etha gene but not the ethb gene completely lost haemolytic activity, although the etha gene was transcribed. the protein expressed by e. coli carrying a recombinant plasmid which encoded the etha gene had haemagglutination activity. the ethb protein was necessary for activation of etha protein (haemolysin). the etha and ethb genes were very prevalent in haemolytic e. tarda strains isolated from diseased fish. transcription of the ethb gene was  regulated by iron. the etha and ethb genes were transcribed independently.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the genes encoding the hemolysin of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == we previously identified a heat- and protease-labile haemolytic activity expressed by haemophilus ducreyi. in order to characterize the haemolysin at the  molecular level, genomic dna from h. ducreyi was probed with haemolysin genes from other gram-negative organisms. the haemolysin genes of proteus mirabilis hybridized to h. ducreyi dna suggesting that the haemolysin of h. ducreyi is related to the proteus/serratia pore-forming family of haemolysins. tn916 mutagenesis was employed to isolate haemolysin-deficient mutants. approximately 5000 tn916 transposon mutants were screened for the loss of haemolytic activity and two mutants were identified. one mutant, designated 35,000-1, was further characterized. sequences flanking the tn916 element in strain 35,000-1 were employed to identify clones from a lambda dashii library of h. ducreyi strain 35,000 dna. a 13 kb insert from one lambda clone was selected for further study.  this 13 kb fragment was able to both confer haemolytic activity to escherichia coli and complement the haemolysin deficiency in strain 35,000-1. the haemolysin  gene cluster was cloned from this 13 kb insert and two genes, designated hhda and hhdb, were identified. the derived amino acid sequence of these genes demonstrated homology to the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of p. mirabilis and serratia marcescens.

TI  == characterization of the hemolytic activity of haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  == h. ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease most prevalent in developing countries. chancroid enhances the heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and is identified in focal outbreaks in the united states, but little is known about its pathogenesis. we studied the  hemolysin produced by h. ducreyi because this molecule might be an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of chancroid. ten strains of h. ducreyi were tested on newly devised blood agar plates and were found to have hemolytic activity. we examined the hemolytic activity of h. ducreyi 35000 further and found that it was heat labile, cell associated, greatest at ph 7.0, and produced  in logarithmic- but not stationary-phase cultures. using transposons tn916 and tn1545-delta 3, we have isolated three classes of transposon mutants of strain 35000: those with no detectable hemolytic activity, those with reduced hemolytic  activity, and those with enhanced hemolytic activity. transposon insertions in the nonhemolytic mutants were located in a dna sequence which hybridized to the proteus mirabilis hemolysin gene. analysis of clones containing overlapping sections of this region served to further localize the h. ducreyi hemolysin gene  and allow its expression in escherichia coli and complementation of the nonhemolytic defect in an h. ducreyi mutant. these experiments indicate that h. ducreyi 35000 produces a hemolysin that is related to the calcium-independent hemolysin produced by p. mirabilis. further experiments are needed to define the  similarity of the h. ducreyi hemolysin to other calcium-independent hemolysins and to determine its role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.
