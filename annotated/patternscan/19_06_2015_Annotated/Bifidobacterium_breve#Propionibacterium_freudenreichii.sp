TI  == human bocavirus in the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children.
AB  == objectives: human bocavirus (hbov) is frequently identified in children with respiratory tract infections, and its role in acute otitis media (aom) has been suggested. the disease associations for the closely related bocaviruses hbov2-4 remain unknown. increasing evidence shows that probiotics may reduce the risk of  aom of viral origin. objectives of the study was to examine the prevalence and persistence of bocaviruses in consecutive nasopharyngeal samples (nps) of otitis-prone children, and whether an association exists between hbov and the child's characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and aom pathogens, and whether probiotics reduce the occurrence of hbov. methods: in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 6-month intervention study, 269 otitis-prone children (aged 9 months to 5.6 years), consumed daily either one capsule of probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) or placebo. after a clinical examination and nps collected at three-time points, the presence and persistence  of hbov1-4 dna in nps was determined by rt-qpcr at the baseline, after 3, and 6 months. results: a high load (>10,000 copies/ml) of hbov dna was detected in 26 (17.1%) of 152 children, and 16 (10.5%) showed a prolonged presence of hbov for at least 3 months. none had dna of hbov2-4. higher number of siblings associated  with increased hbov prevalence (p=0.029). prevalence or persistence of hbov was not significantly associated with other characteristics, respiratory symptoms, or aom pathogens. probiotic intervention significantly reduced the number of hbov dna-positive samples (probiotic vs. placebo: 6.4% vs. 19.0%, or=0.25, ci 95%=0.07-0.94, p=0.039). conclusions: hbov, but not hbov2-4, dna occurs often in  the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children, and may persist for 3-6 months. probiotic treatment possibly reduced the presence of hbov.

TI  == a probiotic mixture including galactooligosaccharides decreases fecal beta-glucosidase activity but does not affect serum enterolactone concentration in men during a two-week intervention.
AB  == a high serum concentration of enterolactone, an enterolignan produced by colonic  microbiota from precursors in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, is associated with reduced risk of acute coronary events. probiotics and prebiotics modify colonic metabolism and may affect the serum enterolactone concentration. the effects of a probiotic mixture alone and with galactooligosaccharides (gos) on serum enterolactone concentration and fecal metabolism were investigated in 18 healthy  men. participants received 3 interventions, each for 2 wk: 1) probiotics [lactobacillus rhamnosus strains gg (lgg) and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium breve bb99, for a total amount of 2 x 10(10) cfu/d]; 2) probiotics and gos 3.8 g/d; 3) probiotics, gos, and rye bread (minimum 120 g/d). serum enterolactone and fecal dry weight, enzyme activities, ph, scfa, lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, propionibacteria, and the strains lgg and lc705 were determined. the serum enterolactone concentration  (nmol/l) tended to be decreased from baseline [mean (95% ci) 18.6 (10.8-26.4)] by probiotics alone [15.2 (7.8-22.7); p = 0.095], was not significantly affected by  probiotics with gos [21.5 (13.2-29.8)], and was increased by probiotics with gos  and rye bread [24.6 (15.4-33.7); p < 0.05]. probiotics alone did not affect fecal beta-glucosidase activity and bifidobacteria, but probiotics with gos decreased beta-glucosidase activity and increased bifidobacteria compared with baseline (p  < 0.05) and with probiotics alone (p < 0.01). in conclusion, this probiotic mixture with or without gos does not significantly affect serum enterolactone concentration. because probiotics with gos decreased fecal beta-glucosidase activity but not serum enterolactone, the reduced fecal beta-glucosidase, within  the range of activities measured, does not seem to limit the formation of enterolactone.

TI  == effect of a multispecies probiotic supplement on quantity of irritable bowel syndrome-related intestinal microbial phylotypes.
AB  == background: probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. our aim was to determine whether ibs-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l.  rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99. the intervention has previously been shown to successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of ibs. methods: the faecal microbiotas of 42 ibs subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). eight bacterial targets within the gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative ibs association were measured. results: a phylotype with 94% similarity to ruminococcus torques remained abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during the intervention (p = 0.02 at 6 months). in addition, the clostridial phylotype,  clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention (p = 0.00 and p = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). the bacterial alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of symptoms. conclusions: the probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific  alterations in the ibs-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16s rdna phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of ibs. these changes may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (la) were incubated with la in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and vaccenic acid (va) formation. the main cla products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-cla; ra) and trans-9,trans-11-cla, were labelled at c-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. traces of trans-10,cis-12-cla formed were labelled to a much lower extent. in pure culture, bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258 formed labelled ra and trans-9,trans-11-cla, while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, roseburia hominis a2-183t, roseburia inulinivorans a2-192t and ruminococcus obeum-like strain a2-162 converted la to va, labelled in a manner indicating that va was formed via c-13-labelled ra. propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm 4902t, a  possible probiotic, formed mainly ra with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-cla  and trans-9,trans-11-cla, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. ricinoleic acid (12-oh-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form cla in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to cla formation described for lactobacillus plantarum. these results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of ra formation via a 10-oh-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different cla isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. a hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-oh-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-cla formation in pure and mixed cultures.

TI  == long-term safety and impact on infection rates of postnatal probiotic and prebiotic (synbiotic) treatment: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == objective: live probiotic bacteria and dietary prebiotic oligosaccharides (together termed synbiotics) increasingly are being used in infancy, but evidence of long-term safety is lacking. in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we studied the safety and long-term effects of feeding synbiotics to newborn infants. methods: between november 2000 and march 2003, pregnant mothers  carrying infants at high risk for allergy were randomly assigned to receive a mixture of 4 probiotic species (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99, and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp shermanii) or a placebo for 4 weeks before delivery. their infants received the same probiotics with 0.8 g of galactooligosaccharides, or a placebo, daily for 6 months after birth. safety data were obtained from clinical examinations and interviews at follow-up visits at ages 3, 6, and 24 months and from questionnaires at ages 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. growth data were collected at each time point. results: of the 1018 eligible infants, 925 completed the 2-year  follow-up assessment. infants in both groups grew normally. we observed no difference in neonatal morbidity, feeding-related behaviors (such as infantile colic), or serious adverse events between the study groups. during the 6-month intervention, antibiotics were prescribed less often in the synbiotic group than  in the placebo group (23% vs 28%). throughout the follow-up period, respiratory infections occurred less frequently in the synbiotic group (geometric mean: 3.7 vs 4.2 infections). conclusion: feeding synbiotics to newborn infants was safe and seemed to increase resistance to respiratory infections during the first 2 years of life.

TI  == effects of multispecies probiotic combination on helicobacter pylori infection in vitro.
AB  == probiotic bacteria alleviate many gastrointestinal symptoms, but the current trend of combining bacteria for additional benefit may make their effects more complex. we characterize four probiotics and their combination in terms of pathogen adhesion, barrier function, cell death, and inflammatory response in helicobacter pylori-infected epithelial cells. h. pylori-infected caco-2 cells were pretreated with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, bifidobacterium breve bb99, or all four organisms in combination. we evaluated the adhesion of h. pylori by in situ immunofluorescence; epithelial barrier function by measurement of transepithelial resistance; apoptosis by measurement of caspase 3 activation; cell membrane leakage by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release; and inflammation by measurement of interleukin-8 (il-8), il-10, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), and leukotriene b(4) (ltb(4)) release. all probiotics inhibited h. pylori adhesion. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and the combination inhibited h. pylori-induced cell membrane leakage. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and the combination initially improved epithelial barrier function but increased the h. pylori-induced barrier  deterioration after incubation for 24 to 42 h. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js inhibited h. pylori-induced il-8 release, whereas l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and b. breve bb99 suppressed pge(2) release. none of these anti-inflammatory effects persisted when the probiotics were used in combination. the combination thus increased the levels of il-8, pge(2), and ltb(4) released from h. pylori-infected epithelial cells. the proinflammatory actions of the individual components dominated the anti-inflammatory effects when the probiotic bacteria were used in combination. our results stress that the therapeutic response can be optimized if probiotic strains are characterized before they are used in combination.

TI  == combining strains of lactic acid bacteria may reduce their toxin and heavy metal  removal efficiency from aqueous solution.
AB  == aims: the primary objective of this study was to compare the removal of cadmium,  lead, aflatoxin b1 and microcystin-lr from aqueous solution by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bbi99/e8, separately and in combination. methods and results: the removal of toxins and heavy metals was assessed in batch experiments. the removal of all compounds was observed to be strain specific. the removal of lead by a combination of all the strains used was observed to be lower than could be predicted from the removal by single strains (p < 0.05). a similar  trend was also observed with the other compounds studied. conclusions: the results show that the toxin-removal capacity of a combination of strains of lactic acid bacteria is not the sum of their individual capacities. therefore, pure single strains should be used when the goal is to remove single compounds. the use of combinations of strains may be beneficial when several compounds are removed together. this needs to be studied in future experiments. significance and impact of the study: lactic acid bacteria have been identified as potent tools for the decontamination of heavy metals, cyanotoxins and mycotoxins. the results of this study should be considered when selecting combinations of bacteria for the simultaneous removal of several toxic compounds.

TI  == effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == background: a multispecies probiotic has shown beneficial effects in irritable bowel syndrome. in addition, certain other probiotics have demonstrated advantageous effects, but the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. aim:  to investigate the mode of action of a multispecies probiotic consisting of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99 by monitoring its effects on intestinal microbiota and markers of microbial activity. methods: a total of 55 irritable bowel syndrome patients participated in this placebo-controlled double-blind trial. subjects received either multispecies probiotic or placebo supplementation daily during a 6-month period. the composition of intestinal microbiota was analysed with real-time polymerase chain reaction, short-chain fatty acids with gas chromatography and enzymes with spectrophotometer. results: each supplemented probiotic strain was detected in faecal samples. intestinal microbiota remained stable during the trial, except for bifidobacterium spp., which increased in the placebo group and decreased in the probiotic group (p = 0.028). no changes in short-chain fatty acids occurred.  a decrease in ss-glucuronidase activity was detected in 67% of the subjects in the probiotic group vs. 38% in the placebo group (p = 0.06). conclusions: factors other than the microbial groups and metabolites studied herein seem responsible for the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by the multispecies probiotic.

TI  == development of new probiotics by strain combinations: is it possible to improve the adhesion to intestinal mucus?
AB  == we evaluated the ability of commercial probiotic strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99, and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) to adhere alone or in different combinations to immobilized mucus. probiotic combinations were clearly able to enhance the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js. for l. rhamnosus gg and p. freudenreichii js, all the combinations  significantly improved adhesion to intestinal mucus, from 29.7 to 34.9% and from  1.9 to 2.3%, respectively. the adhesion of l. rhamnosus lc705 was improved from 0 to 46.4%. the adhesion of b. breve 99 was improved only in combination with l. rhamnosus gg and p. freudenreichii js. our results suggest that probiotic combinations could increase the beneficial health effects as compared with individual strains. combinations of probiotic strains may therefore have synergistic adhesion effects, and such combinations also should be assessed in clinical studies.

TI  == treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.

TI  == effects of anti-helicobacter pylori treatment and probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the effect of recommended antimicrobial treatment of helicobacter pylori infection, consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and lansoprazole, on intestinal microbiota and (ii) to determine the ability of a probiotic combination containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99 to prevent treatment-induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota. faecal samples were obtained from 39 h. pylori-infected patients randomised into two treatment groups. in addition, 19 h. pylori-negative volunteers were included in the study as a control group. samples were collected  before, during and after treatment and microbiota were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and culture. the quantities of the predominant bacterial groups were altered significantly in both groups and disturbances were seen even  9 weeks after treatment was complete. probiotics slightly counteracted the effects of anti-h. pylori treatment, seen as significantly less alterations in the total numbers of aerobes and lactobacilli/enterococci. at baseline, the composition of the microbiota between h. pylori-positive versus h. pylori-negative control individuals differed with regard to clostridia and the total number of anaerobes. the recommended treatment for h. pylori infection induces long-term disturbances in the intestinal microbiota. the probiotic combination appeared to result in only minor changes in the microbiota.

TI  == clinical studies on alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common diagnoses in gastroenterology, but current therapies are inefficient. recent clinical trials suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in ibs. because of the heterogeneity of ibs a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single  strain. we screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic combination consisting of l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, p. freudenreichii  ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99. the clinical efficacy of the probiotic combination was evaluated in ibs patients in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. during six months the subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. ibs symptoms were followed by symptom diaries. the probiotic supplementation demonstrated significant value in reducing ibs symptoms. at the end of the study period the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the probiotic. the probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the combination that each strain alone would not hold. in conclusion, we found a probiotic combination of lgg and three other strains to be effective in alleviating ibs symptoms.

TI  == protection mechanism of probiotic combination against human pathogens: in vitro adhesion to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the ability of commercial strains (l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) in combination with b.  breve 99 or b. lactis bb12 to inhibit, displace and compete with model pathogens  in order to test their influence on the adhesion of selected pathogens to immobilized human intestinal mucus. our results demonstrate that specific probiotic combinations are able to enhance the inhibition percentages of pathogens adhesion to intestinal mucus when compared to individual strains. this  suggests that combinations of probiotic strains are useful and more effective in  inhibition of pathogen adhesion than individual strains. such combinations should be assessed in clinical studies in subjects where the intestinal microbiota aberrancies have been identified.

TI  == a probiotic mixture alleviates symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a controlled 6-month intervention.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder of unknown aetiology. the effect of probiotics in this syndrome remains unclear. aim: to investigate whether a probiotic mixture containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii  ssp. shermanii js is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.  methods: a total of 103 patients fulfilling the rome i or ii criteria took part in this 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. the patients  received a probiotic capsule or a placebo capsule daily. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were recorded. results: at the end the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + borborygmi) was 7.7 (95% ci: -13.9 to -1.6) points lower in the probiotic group (p = 0.015). this represents a median reduction of 42% in the symptom score of the probiotic group compared with 6% in the placebo group. in individual symptoms, borborygmi was milder in the probiotic group (p = 0.008), and for the rest of the symptoms there was a non-significant trend. conclusions: the results indicate that this probiotic mixture is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. considering the high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and the lack of effective therapies, even a slight reduction in symptoms could have positive public health consequences.

TI  == probiotic supplementation improves tolerance to helicobacter pylori eradication therapy--a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized pilot study.
AB  == background: h. pylori is the major cause of chronic gastritis, and a risk factor  for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. aim: to investigate the effect of probiotic  supplementation on the tolerance and efficacy of h. pylori eradication treatment  in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: a total of 338  volunteers were screened for h. pylori infection. the eligibility criteria were met by 47 subjects whose h. pylori infection was verified at the outset and re-evaluated after the treatment by the 13c-urea breath test and by enzyme immunoassay serology. the subjects were randomized to receive probiotic therapy (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosuslc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) or a placebo during h. pylori eradication and for 3 weeks following the treatment, and recorded their daily symptoms in a standardized diary. results: when the frequencies of new or aggravated symptoms were evaluated, no significant differences were found between the two groups for individual symptoms. however, the probiotic group showed less  treatment-related symptoms as measured by the total symptom score change (p = 0.038) throughout the h. pylori eradication therapy in contrast to the placebo group. the h. pylori eradication rate was non-significantly higher in the group receiving probiotic therapy (91% vs. 79%, p = 0.42). in this group the recovery of probiotic bacteria in the faeces increased significantly (p < 0.001). conclusions: in this pilot study, probiotic supplementation did not diminish significantly the frequency of new or aggravated symptoms during h. pylori eradication. however, our data suggest an improved tolerance to the eradication treatment when total symptom severity was taken into account. furthermore, the results show that probiotic bacteria are able to survive in the gastrointestinal  tract despite the intensive antimicrobial therapy.
