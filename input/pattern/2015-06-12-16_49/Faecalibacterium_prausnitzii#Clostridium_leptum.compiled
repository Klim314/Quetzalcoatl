TI  - The intestinal microbiome in spondyloarthritis.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Microbial dysbiosis in the gut is emerging as a common component in various inflammatory disorders including spondyloarthritis (SpA). The depth of this influence has begun to be realized with next-generation sequencing of the gut microbiome providing unbiased assessment of previously uncharted bacterial populations. RECENT FINDINGS: Decreased numbers of Firmicutes, a major phyla of gut commensals, especially the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum have been found in various inflammatory disorders including SpA and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and could be an important link between SpA and gut inflammation. Multiple studies in ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile SpA, and animal models of SpA are revealing common bacterial associations among these diseases as well as IBD. SUMMARY: We are beginning to appreciate the complex relationship between the gut microbiome and host immune regulation and dysregulation in health and disease. Potentially important differences have been revealed in SpA, but cause and effect relationships remain far from established. Many critical questions remain to be answered before we can apply new knowledge to improve therapeutics in SpA.
TI  - Red wine consumption is associated with fecal microbiota and malondialdehyde in a human population.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Red wine intake has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease; its polyphenol content is the primary cause of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties attributed to this beverage. However, the way in which these activities are exerted is not yet clear, although some authors have proposed that intestinal microbiota could be implicated. METHODS: The association between red wine intake, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters and fecal microbial populations has been explored in 38 adult volunteers. Food intake was recorded by means of an annual food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Energy, cholesterol, and ethanol intake were analyzed using the nutrient Food Composition Tables developed by Centro de Ensenanza Superior de Nutricion y Dietetica (CESNID) and polyphenol intake was obtained from the Phenol-Explorer Database. Fecal levels of Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Blautia coccoides group, Clostridium leptum group, Lactobacillus group, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were analyzed by standard methods. RESULTS: Subjects with regular consumption of red wine (mean = 100 ml/day) had lower serum concentrations of MDA and lower fecal levels of B. coccoides, C. leptum, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus. A positive association between MDA levels and B. coccoides and Lactobacillus was also found. CONCLUSION: Regular consumption of red wine appears to be associated with a reduced serum lipoperoxidation in which the intestinal microbiota may be involved.
TI  - High-protein diet modifies colonic microbiota and luminal environment but not colonocyte metabolism in the rat model: the increased luminal bulk connection.
AB  - High-protein diets are used for body weight reduction, but consequences on the large intestine ecosystem are poorly known. Here, rats were fed for 15 days with either a normoproteic diet (NP, 14% protein) or a hyperproteic-hypoglucidic isocaloric diet (HP, 53% protein). Cecum and colon were recovered for analysis. Short- and branched-chain fatty acids, as well as lactate, succinate, formate, and ethanol contents, were markedly increased in the colonic luminal contents of HP rats (P < 0.05 or less) but to a lower extent in the cecal luminal content. This was associated with reduced concentrations of the Clostridium coccoides and C. leptum groups and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in both the cecum and colon (P < 0.05 or less). In addition, the microbiota diversity was found to be higher in the cecum of HP rats but was lower in the colon compared with NP rats. In HP rats, the colonic and cecal luminal content weights were markedly higher than in NP rats (P < 0.001), resulting in similar butyrate, acetate, and propionate concentrations. Accordingly, the expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 and sodium monocarboxylate transporter 1 (which is increased by higher butyrate concentration) as well as the colonocyte capacity for butyrate oxidation were not modified by the HP diet, whereas the amount of butyrate in feces was increased (P < 0.01). It is concluded that an increased bulk in the large intestine content following HP diet consumption allows maintenance in the luminal butyrate concentration and thus its metabolism in colonocytes despite modified microbiota composition and increased substrate availability.
TI  - Alterations in the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) as a predictor of relapse after infliximab withdrawal in Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis could predispose patients to relapse. Gut microbiota composition of patients from the prospective cohort study designed to identify predictive factors of clinical relapse after infliximab discontinuation (STORI Study) was investigated to determine the impact of dysbiosis in CD relapse. METHODS: Fecal samples from 33 patients with CD in this cohort were collected at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and at the end of the follow-up period (19 relapsers and 14 nonrelapsers). Healthy volunteers subjects (n = 29) were used as a control group. The fecal microbiota composition was assessed using quantitative PCR, and comparisons between the patient groups were made at different time points using the Wilcoxon test. The analysis of the time-to-relapse was performed according to the baseline median level of each bacterial signal. RESULTS: Dysbiosis was observed in patients with CD compared with healthy subjects, and it was characterized by low mean counts of Firmicutes (Clostridium coccoides [P = 0.0003], C. leptum [P < 0.0001], and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [P = 0.003]). Lower rates of Firmicutes were seen in relapsers compared with nonrelapsers. Moreover, a low rate of F. prausnitzii (P = 0.014) and a low rate of Bacteroides (P = 0.030) predicted relapse independently from high C reactive protein level (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we report that CD-associated dysbiosis, characterized by a decrease in Firmicutes, correlates with the time-to-relapse after infliximab withdrawal. A deficit in some bacterial groups or species, such as F. prausnitzii, may represent a predictive factor for relapse. Restoring normobiosis in CD could be a new goal for optimal CD management.
TI  - Senior Thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR.
AB  - The fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy Thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Among the 186 DNA bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium colicanis, Eubacterium eligenes, E. rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Megamonas funiformis, Prevotella copri, and Roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Clostridium, and F. prausnitzii. A dendrogram of the PCR-DGGE divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The fecal microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time PCR focused on Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostrium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, C. leptum, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella. The nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera, respectively. No significant differences were found in the counts of Bifidabacterium, Enterobacteriaceae, C. coccoides-E. rectale group, C. leptum group, and Lactobacillus. Therefore, these findings on the microbiota of healthy Thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of South East Asians with similar diets.
TI  - Clostridium leptum group bacteria abundance and diversity in the fecal microbiota of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a case-control study in India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in the fecal bacterial flora occur in inflammatory bowel  disease (IBD). We examined the abundance and diversity of Clostridium leptum group, an important group of carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria, in the feces of patients with IBD and compared them with healthy controls. METHODS: Seventeen healthy controls (HC), 20 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 22 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) participated in the study. DNA extracted from fecal samples was amplified by PCR targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences specific to C. leptum group. The PCR product was subjected to temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (TTGE) and the number and position of individual bands were noted and diversity was estimated. The identity of bands at different positions was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Real time quantitative PCR with Mesa Green, targeted at specific 16S rRNA gene sequences, was used to quantitate C. leptum group and its most prominent constituent, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. RESULTS: Twenty five different operational taxonomic units (OTUs, equivalent to species) were identified constituting the C. leptum group in these participants. Their sequences were deposited in GenBank [accession numbers GQ465348 to GQ465370]. OTU number was significantly reduced in CD (7.7 +/- 3.7, mean +/- SD) and UC (9.0 +/- 3.0) compared to HC (11.9 +/- 2.2) (P=0.0005). The Simpson D index of alpha diversity was not significantly different between the three groups. Total numbers of C. leptum group bacteria and F. prausnitzii were reduced in both CD and UC compared to HC (P=0.0036 and P<0.0001 respectively). Disease activity did not influence numbers of C. leptum or F. prausnitzii in patients with CD or UC. CONCLUSION: C. leptum numbers and diversity were significantly reduced in both CD and UC suggesting that alterations noted were not specific to one disease. This could contribute to reduced short chain fatty acid production in IBD.
TI  - Faecal microbiota composition in vegetarians: comparison with omnivores in a cohort of young women in southern India.
AB  - The effect of vegetarian diets on faecal microbiota has been explored largely through culture-based techniques. The present study compared the faecal microbiota of vegetarian and omnivorous young women in southern India. Faecal samples were obtained from thirty-two lacto-vegetarian and twenty-four omnivorous young adult women from a similar social and economic background. Macronutrient intake and anthropometric data were collected. Faecal microbiota of interest was quantified by real-time PCR with SYBR Green using primers targeting 16S rRNA genes of groups, including: Clostridium coccoides group (Clostridium cluster XIVa), Roseburia spp.-Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides--Prevotella group, Bifidobacterium genus, Lactobacillus group, Clostridium leptum group (Clostridium cluster IV), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus productus--C. coccoides, Butyrivibrio, Enterococcus species and Enterobacteriaceae. The groups were matched for age, socio-economic score and anthropometric indices. Intake of energy, complex carbohydrates and Ca were significantly higher in the omnivorous group. The faecal microbiota of the omnivorous group was enriched with Clostridium cluster XIVa bacteria, specifically Roseburia-E. rectale. The relative proportions of other microbial communities were similar in both groups. The butyryl-CoA CoA-transferase gene, associated with microbial butyrate production, was present in greater amounts in the faeces of omnivores, and the levels were highly correlated with Clostridium cluster XIVa and Roseburia-E. rectale abundance and to a lesser extent with Clostridium leptum and F. prausnitzii abundance and with crude fibre intake. Omnivores had an increased relative abundance of Clostridium cluster XIVa bacteria and butyryl-CoA CoA-transferase gene compared with vegetarians, but we were unable to identify the components of the diet responsible for this difference.
TI  - Decreased colonization of fecal Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  - The mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the M-SHIME, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (HV) and six UC patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. Although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from UC patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. A more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale and Clostridium leptum group, and counts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the UC samples. Counts of Roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the UC samples. qPCR analysis for butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the UC samples. The M-SHIME model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from UC patients compared to HV.
TI  - [The human intestinal microbiota].
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota constitutes a complex ecosystem which is now well recognized for its impact on human health and well-being. It contributes to maturation of the immune system and provides a direct barrier against colonization by pathogens. Its possible implication in diseases of modern societies, currently increasing in prevalence, has been reported. These include allergies, inflammatory bowel diseases and possibly metabolic and degenerative disorders. The analysis of the molecular composition of the human intestinal microbiota indicates marked inter-individual variations which may seem paradoxical considering the high degree of conservation of major functions of the intestinal microbiota such as anaerobic digestion of alimentary fibres. We have characterized a phylogenetic core within the human intestinal microbiota, in terms of composition, i.e., a set of conserved species that could be responsible for major conserved functions. Based on culture-independent molecular assessments, current knowledge enables a definition of criteria qualifying the normal state of the human intestinal microbiota that we call normobiosis. This further enables the identification of specific deviations from normobiosis, i.e., dysbiosis in immune, metabolic or degenerative diseases. Notably, Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease of yet unknown aetiology, is associated with intestinal dysbiosis with a lower representation of the Clostridium leptum group among the Firmicutes phylum. We further showed that the bacterial species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii exerts anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in animal models; this could explain its ability, when detected in the mucosa-associated microbiota of patients in vivo, to protect patients from post-operative recurrence of endoscopic signs of inflammation 6 months after surgical resection of the ileocecal region of the gut. By confirming the major role of the microbiota in bowel-related disorders, which are especially associated with a disruption of homeostasis, we are currently applying high throughput functional metagenomic screens in order to identify signal molecules and mechanisms of bacteria-host cross-talk. Together with the high resolution description of the human intestinal metagenome, as well as explorations of environmental proteins and metabolites, these observations will further our understanding of the functional roles bacteria play in the maintenance of health and well-being in humans. It will open new perspectives for the monitoring and design of strategies for modulating the microbiota for health.
TI  - Low counts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in colitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota is suspected to play a role in colitis and  particularly in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathogenesis. The aim was to compare the fecal microbiota composition of patients with colitis to that of healthy subjects (HS). METHODS: fecal samples from 22 active Crohn's disease (A-CD) patients, 10 CD patients in remission (R-CD), 13 active ulcerative colitis (A-UC) patients, 4 UC patients in remission (R-UC), 8 infectious colitis (IC) patients, and 27 HS were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial counts were transformed to logarithms (Log(10) CFU) for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes (Clostridium leptum and Clostridium coccoides groups) were less represented in A-IBD patients (9.7; P = 0.004) and IC (9.4; P = 0.02), compared to HS (10.8). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species (a major representative of the C. leptum group) had lower counts in A-IBD and IC patients compared to HS (8.8 and 8.3 versus 10.4; P = 0.0004 and P = 0.003). The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in A-IBD (1.3; P = 0.0001) and IC patients (0.4; P = 0.002). Compared to HS, Bifidobacteria were less represented in A-IBD and IC (7.9 and 7.7 versus 9.2; P = 0.001 and P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The fecal microbiota of patients with IBD differs from that of HS. The phylum Firmicutes and particularly the species F. prausnitzii, are underrepresented in A-IBD patients as well as in IC patients. These bacteria could be crucial to gut homeostasis since lower counts of F. prausnitzii are consistently associated with a reduced protection of the gut mucosa.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  - AIMS: To explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) on a vegetable-based diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative, real-time PCR with group-specific 16S rDNA primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (GI) tract phylogenetic groups: the Clostridium leptum-Faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (Clostridium genus cluster IV), the Clostridium coccoides - Eubacterium rectale subgroup (Clostridium cluster XIVa and XIVb), the Bacteroides group (including Prevotella and Porphyromonas), Bifidobacterium spp., the Enterobacteriaceae, the Lactobacillus group (including the genera Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Aerococcus and Weissella), the Clostridium perfringens subgroup (Clostridium cluster I), Enterococcus spp., Veillonella spp., Atopobium spp., Campylobacter spp. and the domain Bacteria. A species-specific 5'-nuclease (Taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess Cl. perfringens abundance. Ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with AGPs and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. The ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the Enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. The progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the Enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. Of note was the finding that all the day 14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for Campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16S rDNA gene copies per gram wet weight. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative, real-time PCR indicates that the effects of drug-free rearing on the chicken GI tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but AGPs may be important in controlling Campylobacter colonization of the caecum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of AGP withdrawal. AGP withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.
TI  - Molecular profiling of the Clostridium leptum subgroup in human fecal microflora  by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis.
AB  - A group-specific PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method  was developed and combined with group-specific clone library analysis to investigate the diversity of the Clostridium leptum subgroup in human feces. PCR products (length, 239 bp) were amplified using C. leptum cluster-specific primers and were well separated by DGGE. The DGGE patterns of fecal amplicons from 11 human individuals revealed host-specific profiles; the patterns for fecal samples collected from a child for 3 years demonstrated the structural succession of the population in the first 2 years and its stability in the third year. A clone library was constructed with 100 clones consisting of 1,143-bp inserts of 16S rRNA gene fragments that were amplified from one adult fecal DNA with one forward universal bacterial primer and one reverse group-specific primer. Eighty-six of the clones produced the 239-bp C. leptum cluster-specific amplicons, and the remaining 14 clones did not produce these amplicons but still phylogenetically belong to the subgroup. Sixty-four percent of the clones were related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (similarity, 97 to 99%), 6% were related to Subdoligranulum variabile (similarity, approximately 99%), 2% were related to butyrate-producing bacterium A2-207 (similarity, 99%), and 28% were not identified at the species level. The identities of most bands in the DGGE profiles for the same adult were determined by comigration analysis with the 86 clones that harbored the 239-bp group-specific fragments. Our results suggest that DGGE combined with clone library analysis is an effective technique for monitoring and analyzing the composition of this important population in the human gut flora.
TI  - Subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  - During studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. Comparative 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the Clostridium leptum supra-generic rRNA cluster and displays a close affinity to some rDNA clones derived from human and pig feces. The nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly Fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with Anaerofilum agile and A. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%). Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, Subdoligranulum variabile. The type strain of S. variabile is BI 114(T) (=CCUG 47106(T)=DSM 15176(T)).
TI  - Design and validation of 16S rRNA probes to enumerate members of the Clostridium  leptum subgroup in human faecal microbiota.
AB  - Among human faecal bacteria, many members of the Clostridium leptum subgroup are  fibrolytic and butyrate producing microorganisms thereby contributing to processes important to colonic health. Yet this phylogenetic subgroup remains poorly described to date. To improve detection and description of members of the C. leptum subgroup, the Clep 866 group probe was developed. Its association with probes targeting the Clostridium viride cluster (Cvir 1414) and Eubacterium desmolans species (Edes 635) allowed for the first time the detection of all members found in this phylogenetic group in human faecal microbiota. A species-specific probe was also designed to detect members of the Ruminococcus callidus species (Rcal 733). The design of signature regions was based on alignment of 16S rRNA sequences isolated from faeces of five healthy adults. Furthermore, an oligonucleotide competitor strategy was developed in order to improve the specificity of the probes formerly validated or designed in this study. The oligonucleotide probes were tested using a collection of target and non-target strains using FISH combined with flow cytometry. These new probes were added to a panel of 18 phylogenetic probes selected to describe faecal microbiota composition in 21 human faeces of healthy adults. Clostridium leptum subgroup represented 22% of the total faecal bacteria and codominated with members of Clostridium coccoides group. The cluster Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the dominant component of the C. leptum subgroup and 20% of the latter subgroup remained unidentified at the species level.
TI  - Growth requirements and fermentation products of Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and a proposal to reclassify it as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  - Two newly isolated strains of obligately anaerobic bacteria from human faeces are shown here to be related to Fusobacterium prausnitzii, which is regarded as one of the most abundant colonizers of the human colon. These strains, along with Fusobacterium prausnitzii ATCC 27768(T) and 27766, are non-motile and produce butyrate, formate and lactate, but not hydrogen as fermentation products. A new finding is that all four strains produce D-lactate, but not L-lactate. The strains have a requirement for acetate in the growth medium and this may account for the previously reported requirement for rumen fluid. The DNA G+C content of the four strains is 47-57 mol%. Together with phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequencing, this establishes that Fusobacterium prausnitzii strains are only distantly related to Fusobacterium sensu stricto and are more closely related to members of Clostridium cluster IV (the Clostridium leptum group). It is proposed that a new genus, Faecalibacterium gen. nov. be created; this genus should include Faecalibacterium prausnitzii gen. nov., comb. nov. ATCC 27768(T) (= NCIMB 13872(T)) (formerly Fusobacterium prausnitzii) as the type species together with ATCC 27766 and the newly isolated strains A2-165 and L2-6.
