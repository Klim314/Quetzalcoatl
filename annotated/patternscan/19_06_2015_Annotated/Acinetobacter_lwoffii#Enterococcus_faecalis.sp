TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.
