TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == shedding light on the microbial community of the macropod foregut using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing.
AB  == twenty macropods from five locations in queensland, australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. specifically, the v3/v4 region of 16s rrna gene was examined. a total of 5040 otus were identified in the data set (post filtering). thirty-two otus were identified as 'shared' otus (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either firmicutes or bacteroidetes (clostridiales/bacteroidales). these phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. genera represented within the shared otus included: unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified lachnospiraceae, unclassified clostridiales, peptococcus sp. coprococcus spp., streptococcus spp., blautia sp., ruminoccocus sp., eubacterium sp., dorea sp., oscillospira sp. and butyrivibrio sp. the composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (macropus rufus, macropus giganteus and macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. specifically, eleven dominant otus that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified  ruminococcaceae, unclassified bacteroidales, prevotella spp. and a syntrophococcus sucromutans. putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in  cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry.

TI  == dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of gayals (bos frontalis), yaks (bos  grunniens) and yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the dominant rumen bacteria in gayals, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle were investigated using pcr-dgge approach. the analysis of dgge profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16s rdna sequences in  dgge profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. dgge profiles revealed that gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of  intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. a total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, yaks and yunnan yellow cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. according to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen  dominant bacteria of gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the  genera lachnospiraceae bacterium, ruminococcus flavefaciens and clostridium celerecrescens. moreover, the dominant bacteria of yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, schwartzia succinivorans and clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. in addition, the dominant bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing prevotella sp., staphylococci lentus, staphylococcus xylosus and corynebacterium casei. present study first detected staphylococcus lentus and staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.
