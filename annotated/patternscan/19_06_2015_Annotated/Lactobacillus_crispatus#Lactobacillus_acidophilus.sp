TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus culture supernatants downregulate expression of cancer-testis genes in the mda-mb-231 cell line.
AB  == lactobacilli are probiotics shown to have antitumor activities. in addition, they can regulate gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. in this study, we aimed to assess anti tumor activities of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus on the mda-mb-231 breast cancer cell line. the effects of culture supernatants were determined by mtt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay. changes in expression of 5 cancer-testis antigens (ctas), namely akap4, odf4, piwil2, rhoxf2 and tsga10 ,were analyzed by quantitative real time rt-pcr. the culture supernatants of the 2 lactobacilli inhibited mda-mb-231 cell proliferation. in addition, transcriptional activity of all mentioned ctas except akap4 was significantly decreased after 24 hour treatment with culture supernatants. this study shows that lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus have antiproliferative activity against mda-mb-231 cells. in addition, these lactobacilli could decrease transcriptional activity of 4 ctas. previous studies  have shown that expression of ctas is epigenetically regulated, so it is possible that lactobacilli cause this expression downregulation through epigenetic mechanisms. as expression of ctas in cancers is usually associated with higher grades and poor prognosis, downregulation of their expression by lactobacilli may have clinical implications.

TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == development of a tiered multilocus sequence typing scheme for members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  == members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of purported health benefits they impart to the consumer. many characteristics of these microorganisms are reported to be strain specific. therefore, proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product labeling, and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production purposes. fifty-two strains of the l. acidophilus complex (l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. gallinarum, l. gasseri, and l. johnsonii) were genotyped using two established methods and compared to a novel multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme. pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis of the hsp60 gene with alui and taqi successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species examined, but it lacked strain-level discrimination. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr (rapd-pcr) targeting the m13 sequence resulted in highly discriminatory profiles  but lacked reproducibility. in this study, an mlst scheme was developed using the conserved housekeeping genes fusa, gpma, gyra, gyrb, lepa, pyrg, and reca, which  identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into  the six species. analysis of the observed alleles suggests that nucleotide substitutions within five of the seven mlst loci have reached saturation, a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the l. acidophilus complex and our unconventional application of a typically intraspecies molecular typing tool. our mlst results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a multispecies complex, with the potential for taxonomic expansion to a broader collection of lactobacillus species.

TI  == differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy and bacterial  vaginosis infected women: a comparative analysis of their cytotoxic effects with  commercial vaginal probiotics.
AB  == background: vaginal flora of healthy women is dominated by lactobacillus species  which can prevent bacterial vaginosis. objectives: the current study aimed to determine the differences in vaginal lactobacilli composition of iranian healthy  and bacterial vaginosis (bv) infected women and compared their cytotoxic effects  with commercial vaginal probiotics. patients and methods: one hundred and seventy eight vaginal specimens were collected from healthy and bv infected women. lactobacillus colonies were obtained by culturing on laked blood bhi and mrs medias and genetically defined by 16s rrna sequencing. differentiating the specimens to normal, intermediate and bv infected were carried out by ison and hey grading protocol. identification of lactobacillus strains in vaginal specimens were performed by multiplex pcr. the inhibitory effects of lactobacilli on hela (tumoral cervical cells) and hncf-pi52 (normal cervical cells) were conducted by mtt and trypan blue assays. results: l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. iners, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus were the most frequently occurring species in vagina of healthy iranian women. l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in the normal than in the bv infected groups.  also the cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was higher than other lactobacilli including commercial probiotics. conclusions: as l. crispatus and l. jensenni were significantly higher in bv infected women and the  cytotoxic effect of l. crispatus on tumoral cervical cells was high, introduction of new probiotics seems necessary.

TI  == [illumina sequencing 16s rrna tagging reveals diverse vaginal microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == objective: to analyze and compare vaginal microbiomes in healthy women at child-bearing ages and patients with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methods: a total of 74 vaginal swabs of the vaginal fornix were collected from 37 bv patients and  37 healthy women. bv status was assessed according to amsels clinical criteria for all the subjects and confirmed using gram-stain criteria (nugent scores). genomic dna of the samples was extracted for amplifying the 16s rrna v6 hypervariable region by pcr and pyrosequencing by illumina. bipes, uchime, tsc and gast were employed to analyze the information of the species from the samples. results: lactobacillus was the predominant species in healthy women (more than 95%), including mainly l. iners and l. crispatus, with a small quantity of gardnerella, granulicatella, streptococcus, prevotella, escherichia and other genus. the alpha diversity was significantly increased in 30 bv patients (p<0.001), and beta diversity also changed obviously shown by decreased  lactobacillus (varying from 45% to 1%, consisting mainly of l. iners) or even absence lactobacillus in 6 cases, with increased relative abundance of gardnerella, prevotella, granulicatella, anaerococcus, parvimonas, peptoniphilus.harei, peptostreptococcus, and dialister. different from previous data, 7 bv cases showed a predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus (75% to 50%). conclusion: lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal  species in healthy women (mainly l. iners and l. crispatus) co-existing with many other bacteria and a variety of microorganisms. lactobacillus is significantly decreased and even absent in most of bv patients, and some cases show the predominance of the rare species l.gasseri and l.acidophilus.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == evidence for gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species  associated with bv, although its exact role in the pathology of bv is unknown. using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that vk2 vaginal epithelial cells take up g. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized g. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with bv. using  vk2 cells and (35)s labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of g. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed g. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to lactobacillus crispatus. internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-d. in addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in vk2 cells exposed to g. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for g. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells.  finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of bv pathogenesis.

TI  == spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
AB  == growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased  for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional  packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.

TI  == heterologous protein display on the cell surface of lactic acid bacteria mediated by the s-layer protein.
AB  == background: previous studies have revealed that the c-terminal region of the s-layer protein from lactobacillus is responsible for the cell wall anchoring, which provide an approach for targeting heterologous proteins to the cell wall of lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, we developed a new surface display system in lactic acid bacteria with the c-terminal region of s-layer protein slpb of lactobacillus crispatus k2-4-3 isolated from chicken intestine. results: multiple sequence alignment revealed that the c-terminal region (lcsb) of lb. crispatus k2-4-3 slpb had a high similarity with the cell wall binding domains sa and cbsa of lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. crispatus. to evaluate the potential application as an anchoring protein, the green fluorescent protein (gfp) or beta-galactosidase (gal) was fused to the n-terminus of the lcsb region, and the fused proteins were successfully produced in escherichia coli, respectively. after mixing them with the non-genetically modified lactic acid bacteria cells, the fused gfp-lcsb and gal-lcsb were functionally associated with the cell surface of various lactic acid bacteria tested. in addition, the binding capacity could be improved by sds pretreatment. moreover, both of the fused proteins could simultaneously bind to the surface of a single cell. furthermore,  when the fused dna fragment of gfp:lcsb was inserted into the lactococcus lactis  expression vector psec:leiss:nuc, the gfp could not be secreted into the medium under the control of the nisa promoter. western blot, in-gel fluorescence assay,  immunofluorescence microscopy and sds sensitivity analysis confirmed that the gfp was successfully expressed onto the cell surface of l. lactis with the aid of the lcsb anchor. conclusion: the lcsb region can be used as a functional scaffold to  target the heterologous proteins to the cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria in  vitro and in vivo, and has also the potential for biotechnological application.

TI  == novel vaginal microflora colonization model providing new insight into microbicide mechanism of action.
AB  == several broad-spectrum microbicides, including cellulose sulfate (cs), have passed conventional preclinical and phase i clinical safety evaluation and yet have failed to protect women from acquiring hiv-1 in phase ii/iii trials. concerns have been raised that current preclinical algorithms are deficient in addressing the complexity of the microflora-regulated vaginal mucosal barrier. we applied a novel microflora-colonized model to evaluate cs and hydroxyethylcellulose (hec), which is used as a "universal placebo" in microbicide trials. cervicovaginal epithelial cultures were colonized with normal vaginal microflora isolates representing common lactobacillus species used as probiotics (l. acidophilus and l. crispatus) or prevotella bivia and atopobium vaginae, most prevalent in the disturbed microflora of bacterial vaginosis (bv).  at baseline, all strains maintained constant epithelium-associated cfus without inducing cytotoxicity and apoptosis. cs selectively reduced epithelium-associated cfus and (to a lesser extent) planktonic cfus, most significantly affecting l. crispatus. inducing only minor changes in sterile epithelial cultures, cs induced expression of innate immunity mediators (rantes, interleukin-8 [il-8], and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor [slpi]) in microflora-colonized epithelia, most significantly potentiating effects of bacteria causing bv. in the absence of cs, all bacterial strains except l. acidophilus activated nf-kappab, although il-8 and rantes levels were increased by the presence of bv-causing bacteria only. cs enhanced nf-kappab activation in a dose-dependent manner under all conditions, including l. acidophilus colonization. hec remained inert. these results offer insights into possible mechanisms of cs clinical failure. the bacterially colonized cervicovaginal model reveals unique aspects of microflora-epithelium-drug interactions and innate immunity in the female genital tract and should become an integral part of preclinical safety evaluation of anti-hiv microbicides and other vaginal formulations. importance: this report provides experimental evidence supporting the concept that the vaginal microflora regulates the epithelial innate immunity in a species- and strain-specific manner and that topically applied microbicides may alter both the bacterial and epithelial components of this homeostatic interaction. our data also highlight the importance of differentiating the effects of biomedical interventions on epithelium-associated versus conventional planktonic bacterial growth when assessing vaginal mucosal health and immunity.

TI  == macrolide resistance and in vitro selection of resistance to antibiotics in lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == spreading of resistance to antibiotics is of great concern due to the increasing  rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. since commensal bacteria may transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on development of resistance should include also lactobacilli. resistance to macrolides, penicillins and tetracycline was determined in 40 isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus crispatus, and lactobacillus  casei isolated from faeces of apparently healthy volunteers. frequency of mutation and changes in susceptibility after serial exposure to these antibiotics at concentrations of 4x and 8x mic were evaluated in susceptible isolates. acquired resistance was defined as an increment in mic values of at least four times in respect to the pre-selection values. resistance to macrolides and/or tetracycline was identified in 14 and 4 isolates, respectively. ermb gene and a2058g mutation in 23s rrna were detected in macrolide resistant isolates. frequencies of mutation of susceptible isolates (n=26) were lower for ampicillin  and erythromycin than for tetracycline. serial exposure to antibiotics led to selection of resistant mutants. however, acquired resistance was rather unstable  and was lost after subcultures in antibiotic-free medium in most mutants. resistance to erythromycin was associated to a a2058g mutation in 23s rrna. in conclusion, results indicate that resistance to macrolides and tetracycline is present among intestinal lactobacilli. decrease in susceptibility following serial exposure to antibiotics might occur in lactobacilli, in a strain- and antibiotic-dependent way. since lactobacilli are often used as probiotics, their  ability to acquire resistance should be evaluated for isolates candidate to be included in probiotics based products.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == patterns of survival and volatile metabolites of selected lactobacillus strains during long-term incubation in milk.
AB  == the focus of this study was to monitor the survival of populations and the volatile compound profiles of selected lactobacillus strains during long-term incubation in milk. the enumeration of cells was determined by both the direct epifluorescent filter technique using carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cfda) staining and the plate method. volatile compounds were analysed by the gas-chromatography technique. all strains exhibited good survival in cultured milks, but lactobacillus crispatus l800 was the only strain with comparable growth and viability in milk, assessed by plate and epifluorescence methods. the  significant differences in cell numbers between plate and microscopic counts were obtained for l. acidophilus strains. the investigated strains exhibited different metabolic profiles. depending on the strain used, 3 to 8 compounds were produced. the strains produced significantly higher concentrations of acetic acid, compared to other volatiles. lactobacillus strains differed from one another in number and contents of the volatile compounds.

TI  == inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by lactobacillus spp. and enterococcus spp. strains.
AB  == bacteriocins (bcn) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. we previously reported on three class iia bcn molecules produced by lactobacillus salivarius b-30514 (or-7), enterococcus faecium b-30746 (e 50-52), and enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae b-30745 (e-760). these bcn are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. to commercially apply such bcn, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. we determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (sp) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of bcn. these sp contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of vkglt. the inducer bacterial isolates used were lactobacillus acidophilus b-30510 and lactobacillus crispatus b-30884. we used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance bcn production. using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of bcn/l of the spent fermentation broth. this information can be used to assist in the production of bcn.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms and hydrogen peroxide production of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from vagina of chinese pregnant women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the indigenous lactobacilli from the vagina of pregnant women and to screen the isolates with antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms. methods: the strains were isolated from pregnant women's vagina and identified using the api50ch system. the ability of the isolates to produce hydrogen peroxide was analyzed semi-quantitatively using the tmb-hrp-mrs agar. the antagonistic effects of the isolates on pathogenic microorganisms were determined with a double layer agar plate. results: one hundred and three lactobacilli strains were isolated from 60 samples of vaginal secretion from healthy pregnant women. among them, 78 strains could produce hydrogen peroxide, in which 68%, 80%, 80%, and 88% had antagonistic effects against candida albicans cmcc98001, staphylococcus aureus cmcc26003, escherichia coli cmcc44113, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cmcc10110, respectively. conclusion: the recovery of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli decreases with the increasing pregnant age and time. the most commonly isolated species from vagina of chinese pregnant  women are lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus. most of l. acidophilus and l. crispatus produce a high h2o2 level.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus  atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell  surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7  to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic  properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive  exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.

TI  == [influence of a xylanase feed additive on lactobacillus species in the jejunum of piglets].
AB  == rrna extracts from the jejunum of rearing piglets fed a wheat/rye based diet with or without a xylanase feed additive were hybridized against eight lactobacillus spp. specific digoxigenin labelled oligonucleotide probes. known concentrations of sample- or culture rna extracts were used to calibrate and quantify hybridization signals from different sample extracts and hybridizations. the xylanase feed additive tended to increase total eubacterial rrna in the terminal  jejunum, probably a result of increased lactobacillus spp. rrna in the central and terminal jejunum. however, individual animal variations were high. l. reuteri was the major lactobacillus species followed by l. acidophilus and l. mucosae. l. amylophilus and l. crispatus were not detected in all rna extracts. the results of this study show that the xylanase feed additive modifies lactobacillus spp. populations on the species level in piglets in addition to their well known effects on digesta viscosity and nutrient digestibility. the implications of these effects for the intestinal microbiota require further analysis.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
AB  == lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. however, some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (iud) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (n-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection  and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. it is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the  growth of escherichia coli. it is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. in this study, we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis,  l. crispatus, l. fermentii and l. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. l. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == the in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide on vaginal microbial communities.
AB  == this study presents a series of experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of h2o2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for ph and nugent score, and lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. the main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating h2o2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added h2o2, (3) kinetics of h2o2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure h2o2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. results showed that h2o2 was liberated especially by: lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii and l. gasseri. hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mm, which under intensive aeration increased even up to 1.8 mm. microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure h2o2. most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by lactobacillus culture supernate producing h2o2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure h2o2. to conclude - the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli is a summation of  various inhibitory mechanisms in which h2o2 plays some but not a crucial role, in addition to other substances.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == viability of vaginal probiotic lactobacilli during refrigerated and frozen storage.
AB  == the viability of six different strains of probiotic vaginal lactobacillus was examined in two different cryoprotective media, during refrigerated versus frozen storage, and using two traditional types of stock cultures for starting the biomass production. freezing at -20 degrees c and -70 degrees c had much less adverse effect on viability than did storage at 7 degrees c, and the reduction in viability was greater at -20 degrees c than at -70 degrees c. the strains showed  variation in the extent of the viability losses during both types of storage. milk-yeast extract (mye) was shown to be the more suitable protective medium to maintain viability of the strains during the storage. the vaginal lactobacillus strains are most stable in mye at -70 degrees c with only a small decrease of the viability observed under these conditions. the viable cell counts of lactobacillus paracasei crl 1251 and crl 1289, l. crispatus crl 1266 and l. salivarius crl 1328 remained around 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 months of storage at -70 degrees c, or up to 18 months for l. acidophilus crl 1259.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

AB  == lactobacilli are the predominant microorganisms of the vaginal bacterial microbiota, and they play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract. in consequence, the interest in their potential use as probiotics has significantly increased during the last decade. in the present study we assessed  the influence of different excipients on the survival of 4 probiotic vaginal lactobacilli incorporated into glycerinated gelatin ovules and stored at 5 degrees c for 60 d. results showed that viability after storage was a strain-dependent characteristic, but inclusion of ascorbic acid significantly increased survival in 3 of the 4 strains tested. the best survival was observed for lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328 in ovules containing skimmed milk. no significant differences in viability were observed between control ovules (glycerogelatin base without excipients) and those containing lactose or tween 80 for any of the strains tested. lactobacillus acidophilus crl 1259 and lactobacillus crispatus crl 1266 were, respectively, the most resistant and sensitive strains to the storage with the different substances. in conclusion, these results provide a basis for selecting excipients to improve the survival of lactobacilli in a probiotic product, in an attempt to ensure the delivery of an adequate number of viable cells to the urogenital tract.

AB  == aims: to characterize lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of ducks or pigs  with respect to the production of extracellular homopolysaccharides (hops) and oligosaccharides. methods and results: lactobacillus strains of duck or pig origin were screened for hops synthesis and >25% of the isolates produced fructans or glucans from sucrose. glucan-forming strains were found within the species lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus animalis and fructan-forming strains were found within lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus acidophilus. the glucan-forming strains of l. reuteri but not l. animalis produced glucose-oligosaccharides in additon to the respective polymers, and two fructan-forming strains of l. acidophilus produced kestose. genes coding  for glycosyltransferases were detected by pcr and partially characterized by sequence analysis. conclusions: a large proportion of lactobacilli from intestinal habitats produce hops from sucrose and polysaccharide formation is generally associated with the formation of glucose- and fructose oligosaccharides. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the metabolic potential of intestinal lactobacilli contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of autochthony in intestinal habitats. moreover, this is the first report of glucose-oligosaccharide production during growth of lactobacilli, and one novel fructosyltransferase and one novel glucansucrase were partially characterized on the genetic level.

AB  == the effect of growth conditions on adhesion was studied in six species belonging  to lactobacillus acidophilus homology groups. namely, 17 strains including 6 fresh isolates of l. gasseri from human feces were assessed for their adherence to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen. these extracellular matrix proteins were used as a model of damaged intestinal mucosa. when the bacteria were grown on mrs agar under anaerobic conditions, all eight l. gasseri  strains and one l. johnsonii strain showed strong adhesiveness to laminin, but not when grown in static mrs broth. a similar pattern was observed in four l. gasseri strains in terms of adherence to fibronectin. no l. gasseri or l. johnsonii strains exhibited adhesion to type iv collagen under either growth condition. adhesion of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus, and l. gallinarum was not affected by the growth conditions. although protease treatment of l. gasseri cells abolished the adhesion, periodate oxidation of the cells increased it except in one strain. the adherence of l. gasseri cells was diminished by periodate and alpha-mannosidase treatments of immobilized laminin.  the above results suggest that mannose-specific proteinaceous adhesion can be induced in l. gasseri by contact with a mucosal surface in the anaerobic intestinal lumen.

AB  == the prevalence of different resistance genes was investigated in lactobacilli of  human and dairy origin by pcr. the presence of erm, van, tet, and cat-tc genes were determined in 16 raw milk, 15 cream, 10 yogurt, 50 hand-made cheese, and 20  industrially produced white-cheese samples of dairy origin and 16 mouth, 32 fecal, and 36 vaginal samples from different subjects of human origin. lactobacilli of dairy and human origin were found to carry only erm(b) and tet(m) genes. the majority of the isolates, lactobacillus crispatus (61), lactobacillus  gasseri (49), lactobacillus plantarum (80) studied were found to harbor either erm(b) or tet(m) gene or both. no resistant lactobacilli was found in raw-milk and cream samples. all the human fecal samples and the majority of vaginal (29 of 36) and mouth (10 of 14) samples were found to carry the resistance genes. while  a third of the hand-made cheeses carried resistant lactobacilli only one industrially produced cheese was found to carry resistant lactobacilli. furthermore, the genes were found in the non-starter species, lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. plantarum, indicating that industrially produced cheeses in this respect could be considered more favorable. these results indicate that drug resistance seems to be very common in turkey. even though the number of dairy samples harboring the resistance genes (17 of 111) is smaller in regards to human samples, 10% of them were still found to carry the resistance genes as well. the  presence of the resistance genes in majority of the samples of human origin and in minority of the samples of dairy origin indicates that drug resistance may be  acquired in the intestinal tract during passage and spread to dairy products by the hands of workers during production.

TI  == a new assay using surface plasmon resonance (spr) to determine binding of the lactobacillus acidophilus group to human colonic mucin.
AB  == a new binding assay to investigate the mechanism of adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to the human intestine was established by the surface plasmon resonance  technique using a biosensor biacore1000. cells of 26 strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group as analytes were eluted onto a sensor chip on which were immobilized biotinylated a-trisaccharide polymer probes having human a-type antigen [(galnacalpha1-3(fucalpha1-2)gal)-] or human colonic mucin of blood type  a (hcm-a) as ligands. in the first screening, high adhesive affinity to the a-trisaccharide bp-probe was observed in l. acidophilus oll2769, l. crispatus jcm8778, la205 and la206. in the second screening, which used hcm-a, only l. acidophilus oll2769 and l. crispatus jcm8778 were selected as adhesive strains with specific binding ability to human a-antigen. the results indicated that some strains of the l. acidophilus group could recognize and bind the sugar chain of a-antigen structure on hcm.

TI  == use of group-specific and rapd-pcr analyses for rapid differentiation of lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  == the increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. in  this study, group-specific pcr and rapd-pcr analyses were used to identify strains of the lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. group-specific pcr with primers for the l. casei and l. acidophilus groups, as well as l. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. for identification of these strains to species or strain level, rapd profiles of the 20 lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the l. acidophilus and l. casei group. all except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, and l. paracasei. dna reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the rapd-pcr.

AB  == four strains isolated from chicken small intestine and strains jcm 1038 and jcm 1039 (designated as lactobacillus acidophilus) were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. they were gram-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods that did not produce gas from glucose. these strains had similar phenotypic characteristics and exhibited intergroup dna relatedness values of >77 %, indicating that they comprised a single species. the 16s rrna gene sequence of a representative strain, jcm 1039(t) (designated as type strain  in this study), was determined and aligned with those of other lactobacillus species. jcm 1039(t) was placed in the lactobacillus delbrueckii cluster of the genus lactobacillus on the basis of phylogenetic analysis and formed an independent cluster that was distinct from its closest neighbours, lactobacillus  amylovorus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, l. acidophilus and lactobacillus helveticus. results of dna-dna hybridization experiments and whole-cell protein profiles clearly indicated that these strains represent a novel lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus kitasatonis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of this species is jcm 1039(t).

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

AB  == the present study aimed to characterize lactobacilli in vaginal fluid from 23 adult healthy women by using high-throughput dna sequencing for identification of a large number of randomly selected colonies appearing on rogosa and blood agar.  the typing method was based on broad-range pcr of 16s rrna gene variable regions  v1 and v3, pyrosequencing, and classification of the fragments by alignment with  ncbi-catalogued sequences and type strain sequences. four major groups of sequences were found among the 402 isolates clearly corresponding to lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners and lactobacillus jensenii when compared to the sequences obtained for type strains.  our results indicate that pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments as used here  is a fast and reliable method well suited for identification to the species level, even within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of cecal microbiota in chicken by the use of 16s rdna clone libraries.
AB  == the chicken cecum contains a great many bacteria, most of which are strict anaerobes. a strictly anaerobe culture-based method was used in the present study, in conjunction with the 16s rdna clone library, to elucidate bacterial diversity and the phylogenetic relationship of cecal microbiota in the chicken. a comparative 16s rdna sequence analysis of cultivated strains and retrieved clones from cecal contents was performed. approximately 90% of the bacterial cells detected by microscopy did not form colonies on a medium 10 in plate-in-bottle. the 19 isolated strains yielded 11 distinct rdna sequences, 58% of which were classified as low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 26% were related to bacteroides spp., and 16% were classified as proteobacteria. based on the sequence analysis of 164 clones, 24% were identified to belong to 8 known species and 76% were considered to be 65 novel phylotypes. approximately 94% of cloned sequences were  classified into low g + c gram-positive bacteria, 4% were related to bacteroides  spp., and 2% were classified into proteobacteria. clostridium subcluster xiva (38%), clostridium cluster iv (13%), lactobacillus spp. (24%), and bacteroides spp. (4%) were the major groups constituting the cecal microbiota in chicken, in  which the clostridium subcluster xiva was the most phylogenetically diverse group in chicken cecum. the 16s rdna sequences of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. reuteri were the most frequently found in the lactobacillus group in chicken cecum.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus flora of healthy swedish women.
AB  == species of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are generally considered to constitute most of the vaginal lactobacillus flora, but the flora varies between  studies. however, this may be due to difficulties in identifying the closely related species within the l. acidophilus complex by using traditional methods and to variations in the vaginal status of the participants. two hundred two isolates from the vaginal fluids of 23 swedish women without bacterial vaginosis, as defined by the criteria of nugent et al. (r. p. nugent, m. a. krohn, and s. l. hillier, j. clin. microbiol. 29:297-301, 1991), were typed by randomly amplified  polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis and identified to the species level by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, multiplex pcr, and 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. the vaginal flora of most participants was dominated by a single rapd type, but five of them harbored two rapd types representing two different species or strains. the most frequently occurring species were lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. l. iners  has not previously been reported as one of the predominant lactobacillus species  in the vagina.

TI  == identification of lactobacillus crispatus by polymerase chain reaction targeting  s-layer protein gene.
AB  == aims: this study aimed to develop a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method to identify lactobacillus crispatus. methods and results: a primer set (cbsa2f-cbsa2r) for amplifying conserved regions of s-layer genes was designed to identify lact. crispatus and the specificity of this set was compared with that of another primer set (cri 16si-cri 16sii) which has been reported as a species-specific primer set targeting the 16s rrna gene. among species in the lact. acidophilus a1-a4 groups, when kod polymerase was used for amplification, the primer set cbsa2f-cbsa2r gave pcr products with lact. crispatus strains only. however, when taq polymerase was used, this primer set gave products with one lact. amylovorus strain as well as with lact. crispatus strains. the primer set cri 16si-cri 16sii gave pcr products with lact. crispatus strains and two lact. acidophilus strains, regardless of whether the polymerase used was kod or taq. conclusions: a pcr targeting the s-layer gene and amplified with kod polymerase can identify lact. crispatus accurately and rapidly. significance and impact of the study: to the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a pcr method for the specific identification of lact. crispatus.

AB  == a total of 91 type and reference strains of the lactobacillus casei group and the l acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device riboprinter microbial characterization system. the l. casei group was divided into five (c1-c5) genotypes by ribotyping. among them, the strain of l. casei atcc 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of l. paracasei strains and l casei jcm 1134t generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of l. zeae. these results supported the designation of l. casei atcc  334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of l. casei jcm 1134t as l. zeae. the l. acidophilus group was also divided into 14  (a1-a11, b1-b3) genotypes by ribotyping. l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus and l. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by l. gasseri and l. johnsonii. this result confirmed previous data that the l. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. five strains of l. acidophilus and two strains of l. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. most strains belonging to the l. casei group and the  l. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. thus this riboprinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible  genetic information for the identification of many strains.

TI  == the s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s-protein assembly and cell wall binding.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the  s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac  domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l.  crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped  cells or to lactobacillus casei.

TI  == characterisation and selection of a lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.

AB  == a total of 26 lactobacillus strains were isolated from various mild yoghurts and  novel-type probiotic dairy products and from a starter culture preparation and were identified by using dna-dna hybridization technique. the species present in  those products were found to be lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. dna homology analysis revealed that some strains had been misclassified by their investigators. three strains designated as l. acidophilus (l. acidophilus la-1, l. acidophilus atcc 43121 and the lactobacillus strain from biogarde culture) were found to belong to l. johnsonii and l. acidophilus l1 to be l. crispatus. strains designated as l. casei were found to be members of three separate species: l. casei, l. paracasei  and l. rhamnosus. viable numbers of lactobacilli in mild and probiotic yoghurts varied greatly including some products with very low lactobacillus counts. the majority of the probiotic yoghurts, however, contained viable counts above 10(5)  per g even at the end of the best before use period.

TI  == lactobacillus species identification, h2o2 production, and antibiotic resistance  and correlation with human clinical status.
AB  == lactobacilli recovered from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory tract, and gut of 20 hospitalized immunocompromised septic patients were analyzed. biochemical carbohydrate fermentation and total soluble cell protein profiles were used to identify the species. hydrogen peroxide production was measured. susceptibility to 19 antibiotics was tested by a diffusion method, and the mics of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, and levofloxacin were determined. a small number of species produced h2o2, and antibiotic susceptibilities were species related. eighteen (90%) of the isolates  were l. rhamnosus, one was l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, and one was l. crispatus. l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, and the type strains were neither h2o2 producers nor vancomycin susceptible (mics, >/=256 microgram/ml). l. crispatus, as well as most of the type strains of lactobacilli  which belong to the l. acidophilus group, was an h2o2 producer and vancomycin susceptible (mics, <4 microgram/ml).

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == evaluation of random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr as a method to differentiate lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus johnsonii.
AB  == the technique random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr was evaluated as a method to differentiate lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus johnsonii. representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from different clusters obtained by numerical analysis of  total soluble cell protein patterns. results obtained by rapd-pcr corresponded well with results obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. the type strains of each species displayed different rapd profiles. strains with identical l(+)- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent lactic dehydrogenase (nldh) electrophoretic profiles could be distinguished on the basis of their rapd profiles.

TI  == a collagen-binding s-layer protein in lactobacillus crispatus.
AB  == two s-layer-expressing strains, lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 and lactobacillus acidophilus jcm 1132, were assessed for adherence to proteins of the mammalian extracellular matrix. l. crispatus jcm 5810 adhered efficiently to  immobilized type iv and i collagens, laminin, and, with a lower affinity, to type v collagen and fibronectin. strain jcm 1132 did not exhibit detectable adhesiveness. within the fibronectin molecule, jcm 5810 recognized the 120-kda cell-binding fragment of the protein, while no bacterial adhesion to the amino-terminal 30-kda or the gelatin-binding 40-kda fragment was detected. jcm 5810 but not jcm 1132 also bound (sup125)i-labelled soluble type iv collagen, and this binding was efficiently inhibited by unlabelled type iv and i collagens and  less efficiently by type v collagen, but not by laminin or fibronectin. l. crispatus jcm 5810 but not l. acidophilus jcm 1132 also adhered to matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane preparation from mouse sarcoma cells, as well as  to the extracellular matrix prepared from human intestine 407 cells. s-layers from both strains were extracted with 2 m guanidine hydrochloride, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. the s-layer protein from jcm 5810 bound (sup125)i-labelled type iv collagen, whereas no binding was seen with the s-layer protein from jcm 1132. binding of (sup125)i-collagen iv to  the jcm 5810 s-layer protein was effectively inhibited by unlabelled type i and iv collagens but not by type v collagen, laminin, or fibronectin. it was concluded that l. crispatus jcm 5810 has the capacity to adhere to human subintestinal extracellular matrix via a collagen-binding s-layer.

TI  == hemagglutination activity of lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the cells of 28 strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group were evaluated for hemagglutination (ha) activity. the activity was found in the surface layer (sl)  protein fraction extracted by 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. the most sl proteins from the a group strains (l. acidophilus (a1), l. crispatus (a2), l. amylovorus (a3), and l. gallinarum (a4)) showed ha activity, but the proteins from the b group strains (l. gasseri (b1) and l. johnsonii (b2)) showed no activity. the sl  proteins from the a group strains were composed in common of a main component having molecular mass of about 40-45 kda on sds-page. the sl proteins from jcm 1034 strain that showed the highest ha activity was fractionated by cm-toyopearl  ion-exchange chromatography. the highest ha activity was detected in the major protein of 41 kda. this protein was purified and shown to be composed of about 50% of hydrophobic amino acids. the ha activity of the protein (1034 lectin) was  specifically inhibited by fetuin and bovine lactoferrin at the concentrations of  80 and 160 micrograms/ml, respectively. the removal of n-acetylneuraminic acid from fetuin significantly decreased the inhibitory activity.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.

TI  == a lactobacillus helveticus-specific dna probe detects restriction fragment length polymorphisms in this species.
AB  == a cloned 2-kb ecori fragment (fragment f) from a 34-kb plasmid of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 1094 was shown by dot blot to specifically hybridize to total dnas of 75 l. helveticus strains. no hybridization was found with l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l.  gasseri, or l. intestinalis strains. when southern blots of ecori digests of l. helveticus strains were probed with fragment f, these strains displayed restriction fragment length polymorphisms on the basis of which they could be grouped into several clusters.

TI  == systematics of the lactobacillus population on rat intestinal mucosa with special reference to lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the systematics of the lactobacillus population of the intestines of 88 different rats was studied; 80 rats had been fed on fermented oat-meal soup (molin et al. 1992). one-hundred-twenty-two lactobacillus strains from the intestinal mucosa were phenotypically classified together with twenty-eight reference strains of lactobacillus and leuconostoc, using 49 unit characters. data were examined using jaccard coefficient, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. two major and eleven minor clusters were defined at the 76% sj-similarity level: cluster 1 included thirty isolates which could not be identified further, but had resemblance to the type strains of l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. crispatus, and to some extent to l. acidophilus. cluster 12 including fifty-four intestinal isolates was identified as l. reuteri; and so was cluster 13 (five isolates). isolates of the major clusters were found in all parts of the intestines. the genomic homogeneity of the l. reuteri isolates was scrutinized by endonuclease restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna, and the isolates could  be divided into six genomic strains.

TI  == production of succinic acid from citric acid and related acids by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus strains produced succinic acid in de man-rogosa-sharpe  broth to various extents. among 86 fresh isolates from fermented cane molasses in thailand, 30 strains (35%) produced succinic acid; namely, 23 of 39 lactobacillus reuteri strains, 6 of 18 l. cellobiosus strains, and 1 of 6 unidentified strains. all of 10 l. casei subsp. casei strains, 5 l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strains, 6 l. mali strains, and 2 l. buchneri strains did not produce succinic acid. among 58 known strains including 48 type strains of different lactobacillus species, the strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. jensenii, and l. parvus produced  succinic acid to the same extent as the most active fresh isolates, and those of  l. alimentarius, l. collinoides, l. farciminis, l. fructivorans (1 of 2 strains tested), l. malefermentans, and l. reuteri were also positive, to lesser extents. diammonium citrate in de man-rogosa-sharpe broth was determined as a precursor of the succinic acid produced. production rates were about 70% on a molar basis with two fresh strains tested. succinic acid was also produced from fumaric and malic  acids but not from dl-isocitric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and pyruvic acids. the present study is considered to provide the first evidence on the production of succinic acid, an important flavoring substance in dairy products and fermented beverages, from citrate by lactobacilli.
