TI  == detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. genomic dna was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna genes. fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. nine bacteria such as eubacterium saphenum, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their  detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis  than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =p<0.05). two species (mogibacterium timidum and porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly  more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (p<0.002), with p. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. there were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.

TI  == new bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16s  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. the purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. species-specific ribosomal 16s primers for pcr amplification were developed for detection of new species. associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones d084 and bh017 from the deferribacteres phylum, au126 from the bacteroidetes phylum, megasphaera clone bb166, clone x112 from the op11 phylum, and clone i025 from the tm7 phylum, and the named species eubacterium saphenum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, and cryptobacterium curtum. species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone w090 from the deferribacteres phylum and clone bu063 from the bacteroidetes, and named species atopobium rimae and atopobium parvulum.
