TI  == in vitro evaluation of lactobacillus gasseri strains of infant origin on adhesion and aggregation of specific pathogens.
AB  == numerous lactobacillus species are members of the normal healthy human intestinal microbiota, and members of the lactobacillus family predominate among the current marketed probiotic strains. most of the current commercial probiotic strains have not been selected for specific applications but rather have been chosen based on  their technological properties. often the ability of such strains to temporarily  colonize the gastrointestinal tract may be lacking, and the interactions with intestinal microbiota are few. furthermore, the competitive exclusion properties  of potential probiotic bacteria are strain specific and vary greatly. thus, it is highly desirable that new candidate probiotic isolates originate from the healthy target population. in this study, seven newly isolated strains of lactobacillus gasseri originating from feces of a healthy newborn child were evaluated for their ability to adhere to intestinal mucus, to autoaggregate and coaggregate with the model pathogens cronobacter sakazakii (atcc 29544) and clostridium difficile (1296). all the bacterial strains, single or in combination, in viable  and nonviable forms, were able to autoaggregate. the coaggregation with c. sakazakii or c. difficile was higher (p < 0.05) in nonviable than in the viable forms. single l. gasseri strains showed similar adhesion abilities to intestinal  colon mucus. the seven l. gasseri strains when combined were also able to significantly compete with, displace, and inhibit the adhesion of c. sakazakii and c. difficile in the mucus model. this study demonstrates that the studied l.  gasseri strains fulfill the basic adhesion and aggregation properties for probiotics and could be considered for potential future use in children.

TI  == intestinal lactoflora in estonian and norwegian patients with antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == the disruption of intestinal microbiota is an important risk factor for the development of clostridium difficile caused antibiotic associated diarrhea (aad). the role of intestinal lactoflora in protection against c. difficile is unclear.  fecal samples (n = 74) from aad patients were investigated for c. difficile and lactobacilli by culture and real-time pcr. lactobacilli were identified by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr (eric-pcr) and sequencing of  16s rrna. in c. difficile negative cases we found somewhat higher counts of intestinal lactobacilli (5.02 vs. 2.15 cfu log(10)/g; p = 0.053) by culture and more frequently lactobacillus plantarum (33.3% vs. 9.4%; p = 0.03) as compared with positive ones. results of total counts of lactobacilli comparing estonian and norwegian samples were conflicting by culture and pcr. we found higher colonization of norwegian aad patients with l. plantarum (21% vs. 5%, p = 0.053)  and estonians with lactobacillus gasseri (19% vs. 2%, p = 0.023). particular lactobacilli (e.g. l. plantarum) may have a role in protection against c. difficile, whereas the meaning of total counts of lactobacilli remains questionable. in different persons and nations, different lactobacilli species may have a protective role against c. difficile.
