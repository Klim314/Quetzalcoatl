TI  == bacteraemia due to tribe proteeae: a review of 132 cases during a decade (1991-2000).
AB  == to characterize the clinical features of bacteraemia due to tribe proteeae, 132 cases among 130 patients from 1991 to 2000 were analysed. the organisms included  the proteus species in 63 cases (p. mirabilis in 41, p. penneri in 2 and p. vulgaris in 20), the providencia species in 8 (p. rettgeri in 3 and p. stuartii 5) and morganella morganii in 61. morganella bacteraemia occurred more frequently in the hospital (70.5%). biliary and hepatic diseases were predominant in cases with morganella bacteraemia while cardiovascular, urological and neurological diseases were more common in cases with proteus bacteraemia. biliary drainage catheters had more frequently been placed in cases with morganella bacteraemia (39.3%, p < 0.001), and urinary catheters more frequently in cases with proteus bacteraemia (17.5%). biliary infection was most common in cases with morganella bacteraemia (49.2%), while urinary tract infection (uti) was most common in cases with proteus bacteraemia (47.6%). mortality directly related to bacteraemia due to tribe proteeae was 20.8% (22.6, 50.0 and 15.0% for proteus, providencia and morganella bacteraemia, respectively). in conclusion, morganella bacteraemia was  most frequently associated with biliary infection, while proteus bacteraemia was  most frequently with uti. providencia bacteraemia was relatively uncommon and it  can be associated with infections other than uti.

TI  == molecular characterization of the genera proteus, morganella, and providencia by  ribotyping.
AB  == the so-called proteus-providencia group is constituted at present by three genera and 10 species. several of the recognized species are common opportunistic pathogens for humans and animals. different methods based on the study of phenotypic characters have been used in the past with variable levels of efficiency for typing some species for epidemiological purposes. we have determined the rrna gene restriction patterns (ribotypes) for the type strains of the 10 different species of the genera proteus, morganella, and providencia. visual inspection of ecorv- and hincii-digested dna from the type strains showed  remarkably different patterns for both enzymes, but ecorv provided better differentiation. both endonucleases were retained to study a large number of wild and collection strains belonging to the different species. clinical isolates of proteus mirabilis, proteus penneri, morganella morganii, and providencia heimbachae showed patterns identical or very similar to those of the respective type strains, so that groups of related patterns (ribogroups) were found to correspond to the diverse species. on the contrary, distinct ribogroups were detected within providencia alcalifaciens (two ribogroups with both enzymes), providencia rettgeri (four ribogroups with ecorv and five with hincii), providencia stuartii (two ribogroups with ecorv), providencia rustigianii (two ribogroups with hincii), and proteus vulgaris (two ribogroups with both enzymes). the pattern shown by the ancient p. vulgaris type strain nctc 4175 differed considerably from both p. vulgaris ribogroups as well as from the newly proposed  type strain atcc 29905 and from any other strain in this study, thus confirming its atypical nature. minor differences were frequently observed among patterns of strains belonging to the same ribogroup. these differences were assumed to define ribotypes within each ribogroup. no correlation was observed between ribogroups or ribotypes and biogroups of p. vulgaris, p. alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, and p.  rettgeri. since, not only different species showed different rrna gene restriction patterns, but also different ribogroups and ribotypes have been found in the majority of the species, ribotyping would be a sensitive method for molecular characterization of clinical isolates belonging to the genera proteus,  morganella, and providencia.

TI  == the prevalence of gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in the proteeae and its role  in the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  == the prevalence of aac(2')-ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-n-acetyltransferase in providencia stuartii, among species of the proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in p. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan o-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. an evaluation of the mics of gentamicin for each of the species of the proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of o-acetylation of peptidoglycan. the entire aac(2')-ia gene was used as a probe in southern hybridization experiments against genomic dna from each species of the proteeae. a sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-ia was present only in proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also  observed to the restriction digested dna from providencia rettgeri. other bacteria that o-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a  homologous dna sequence was only found in neisseria subflava. these data suggest  that aac(2')-ia may contribute to the o-acetylation of peptidoglycan in p. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of quinolone carboxylic acids against proteeae.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 198 isolates of precisely identified proteeae species to six quinolone antimicrobials were determined. significant differences  in susceptibility patterns among various proteeae to the quinolones examined were demonstrated. although providencia stuartii was found to be the most resistant to quinolones including the very active agent ciprofloxacin, fully speciated prov. rettgeri were also markedly resistant as well. in contrast prov. alcalifaciens was extremely sensitive to these agents. some strains of proteus penneri were more resistant to the three newer compounds (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin) than strains of pr. vulgaris suggesting that recognition of this species may be important in surveys of the in-vitro activity of antibiotics. pr.  mirabilis and morganella morganii were very sensitive to the newer agents. the patterns of resistance seen in the three newer agents were reflected in the older agents acrosoxacin and cinoxacin. accurate speciation of proteeae in surveys of susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents is important if misleading results are not to be reported.
