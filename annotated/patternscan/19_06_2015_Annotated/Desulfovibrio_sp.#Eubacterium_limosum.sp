TI  == enrichment of microbial electrolysis cell biocathodes from sediment microbial fuel cell bioanodes.
AB  == electron-accepting (electrotrophic) biocathodes were produced by first enriching  graphite fiber brush electrodes as the anodes in sediment-type microbial fuel cells (smfcs) using two different marine sediments and then electrically inverting the anodes to function as cathodes in two-chamber bioelectrochemical systems (bess). electron consumption occurred at set potentials of -439 mv and -539 mv (versus the potential of a standard hydrogen electrode) but not at -339 mv in minimal media lacking organic sources of energy. results at these different potentials were consistent with separate linear sweep voltammetry (lsv) scans that indicated enhanced activity (current consumption) below only ca. -400 mv. mfc bioanodes not originally acclimated at a set potential produced electron-accepting (electrotrophic) biocathodes, but bioanodes operated at a set  potential (+11 mv) did not. co(2) was removed from cathode headspace, indicating  that the electrotrophic biocathodes were autotrophic. hydrogen gas generation, followed by loss of hydrogen gas and methane production in one sample, suggested  hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. there was abundant microbial growth in the biocathode chamber, as evidenced by an increase in turbidity and the presence of  microorganisms on the cathode surface. clone library analysis of 16s rrna genes indicated prominent sequences most similar to those of eubacterium limosum (butyribacterium methylotrophicum), desulfovibrio sp. a2, rhodococcus opacus, and gemmata obscuriglobus. transfer of the suspension to sterile cathodes made of graphite plates, carbon rods, or carbon brushes in new bess resulted in enhanced  current after 4 days, demonstrating growth by these microbial communities on a variety of cathode substrates. this report provides a simple and effective method for enriching autotrophic electrotrophs by the use of smfcs without the need for  set potentials, followed by the use of potentials more negative than -400 mv.
