TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == tla-1: a new plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli r170, isolated from the urine of an infected patient, was resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin but was susceptible to amikacin, cefotetan, and imipenem. this particular strain contained three different plasmids that encoded two beta-lactamases with pis of 7.0 and 9.0. resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole was transferred by conjugation from e. coli r170 to e. coli j53-2. the transferred plasmid, rza92, which encoded a single beta-lactamase, was 150 kb in length. the cefotaxime resistance gene that  encodes the tla-1 beta-lactamase (pi 9.0) was cloned from the transconjugant by transformation to e. coli dh5alpha. sequencing of the bla(tla-1) gene revealed an open reading frame of 906 bp, which corresponded to 301 amino acid residues, including motifs common to class a beta-lactamases: (70)sxxk, (130)sdn, and (234)ktg. the amino acid sequence of tla-1 shared 50% identity with the cme-1 chromosomal class a beta-lactamase from chryseobacterium (flavobacterium) meningosepticum; 48.8% identity with the veb-1 class a beta-lactamase from e. coli; 40 to 42% identity with cbla of bacteroides uniformis, per-1 of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and per-2 of salmonella typhimurium; and 39% identity with cepa of bacteroides fragilis. the partially purified tla-1 beta-lactamase had a molecular mass of 31.4 kda and a pi of 9.0 and preferentially hydrolyzed cephaloridine, cefotaxime, cephalothin, benzylpenicillin, and ceftazidime. the enzyme was markedly inhibited by sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid. tla-1 is a new  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase of ambler class a.

TI  == effect of h2-receptor antagonists on bile acid metabolism.
AB  == background: several reports have been presented concerning pronounced overgrowth  of bacteria in gastric juices of patients treated with h2-receptor antagonists. however, there has been no report concerning influence of h2-receptor antagonists on jejunal flora. thus, to investigate the influence and its effect on bile acid  metabolism, this study was performed: 1) to examine whether patients with gastric ulcers who have been treated with h2-receptor antagonists have positive bile acid breath tests due to bacterial overgrowth in their jejuna; 2) to verify that these bacteria, isolated and identified, have deconjugation ability; and 3) to determine whether the changes in the gastric ph are related to bacterial overgrowth. methods: the methods used were detection of deconjugation of bile acids in early phase by a bile acid breath test using 5 muci of oral glycine-1-14c labeled glycocholate, aspiration of jejunal fluids by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip, and examination of deconjugation ability by thin layer chromatography. results: expired breath samples from all 18 patients after administration of h2-receptor antagonists showed a significant increase in 14co2 specific activity compared with those before administration of  h2-receptor antagonist and the normal controls, and bacterial overgrowth was found in the jejunal fluid of the patients after administration of h2-receptor antagonist. the administration of tetracycline to the 18 patients reduced the 14co2 specific activity significantly. the following species were identified in the jejunal fluid samples obtained from the patients: escherichia coli, candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus, lactobacillus bifidus, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis, eubacterium lentum, and eubacterium parvum. all of the species identified except  for escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans deconjugated bile acids. there were significant correlations between the 14co2 activity and gastric ph before and after administration of h2-receptor antagonist, respectively. conclusions: patients with gastric ulcers who were treated with h2-receptor antagonists have increased bile acid deconjugation due to bacterial overgrowth in their jejuna containing species that can deconjugate bile acids. the bacterial overgrowth is probably associated with a shift to neutral ph in the gastric juice caused by the h2-receptor antagonists.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
