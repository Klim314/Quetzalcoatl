TI  - Rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  - The maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus prevotii, 3% in Ruminococcus albus, 4% in Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptococcus niger and Megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in Peptococcus magnus. The biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
TI  - Obligately anaerobic bacterial species isolated from foot-rot lesions in goats.
AB  - Lesions showing clinical signs of foot-rot from 120 goats were cultured on six selective media during October 1987 to November 1988. A total of 582 strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to 50 different species was isolated and identified. The anaerobes most frequently isolated belonged to the following genera: Bacteroides (80%), Peptostreptococcus (63.6%), Megasphaera (40%), Fusobacterium (29.2%), Clostridium (22.5%), Propionibacterium (12.5%), Eubacterium (11.7%) and Leptotrichia (10.8%). Percentages for Acidaminococcus, Peptococcus, Tissierella, Wolinella and Veillonella were below 10%. The following species were identified in 10% or more of cases: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (61.7%), Bacteroides buccae (51.7%), Bacteroides nodosus (42.5%), Megasphaera elsdenii (40%), Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis (22.5%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (19.2%), Leptotrichia buccalis (11.7%) and Clostridium perfringens (10%). Lower percentages were obtained for the remaining species. The efficiency and selectivity of the six culture media used for isolation are discussed.
TI  - Isolation and identification of anaerobic bacteria from ovine foot rot in Spain.
AB  - A microbiological study was made of 125 Merino sheep showing clinical signs of foot rot. A total of 435 strictly anaerobic strains were isolated, belonging to the following genera: Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Tissierella, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera, Eubacterium, Acidaminococcus, Clostridium, Peptococcus and Propionibacterium. Of the 35 species obtained, the following were found in more than 10 per cent of animals sampled: Bacteroides nodosus, B putredinis, B buccae, B ruminicola subspecies brevis, Tissierella praeacuta, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Megasphaera elsdenii. Six culture media were used for isolation. Agar brucella and agar brucella enriched with G-N anaerobe supplement proved to be the most efficient for isolating anaerobic bacteria.
