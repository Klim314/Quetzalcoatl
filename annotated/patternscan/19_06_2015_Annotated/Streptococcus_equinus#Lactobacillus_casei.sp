TI  == potentiation by metal ions of the efficacy of the ionophores, monensin and tetronasin, towards four species of ruminal bacteria.
AB  == concentrations of na(+), k(+) and ca(2+) in the growth medium were varied within  limits normally found in vivo to determine how cation concentrations affect the sensitivity of ruminal bacteria to the ionophores, monensin (a na(+)/h(+) and k(+)/h(+) exchanger) and tetronasin (ca(2+)/h(+)). high [na(+)] (172 mm cf. 137 mm in control medium) enhanced the efficacy of monensin towards eubacterium ruminantium 2388, streptococcus bovis c277, lactobacillus casei lb17 and prevotella albensis m384. high [k(+)] (35 mm cf. 19 mm) alone caused a decreased  potency of both ionophores, except with l. casei. added ca(2+) (7.4 cf. 2.8 mm) increased the potency of tetronasin when [na(+)] was low. high [na(+)] alone also potentiated the efficacy of tetronasin. monensin caused intracellular [na(+)] and [k(+)] to be decreased in the most sensitive of these organisms, e. ruminantium,  whereas only intracellular [ca(2+)] fell with tetronasin. the changes were small; however, deltap fell by only 20 mv after 2 h when ionophores caused immediate cessation of growth. atp concentrations fell by 77% and 75% with monensin and tetronasin, respectively. thus, altering cation concentrations might be used to potentiate the efficacy of ionophores, by increasing the rate of energy expenditure to maintain ionic homoeostasis in sensitive bacteria.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus casei on streptococcus bovis in faecal flora.
AB  == bacteraemia caused by streptococcus bovis is often associated with colorectal tumours. also, experimental studies have been proposed that s bovis acts as a promoter of tumours. we report the case of a man with colon adenoma who had a high proportion of s bovis in his faecal flora. he was treated with a lactobacillus casei preparation (blp) and the effect on the faecal flora was examined. l casei reduced the proportion of s bovis (from 43% down to 9%), and the effect continued after the administration of blp was stopped. our data indicate that blp can repress the excessive colonisation of s bovis.

TI  == lactobacillus casei secreting alpha-msh induces the therapeutic effect on dss-induced acute colitis in balb/c mice.
AB  == the neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha- msh) has anti-inflammatory property by downregulating the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines. because alpha-msh elicits the anti-inflammatory effect in various inflammatory disease models, we examined the therapeutic effect of oral administration of recombinant lactobacillus casei, which secretes alpha-msh (l. casei-alpha-msh), on dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in balb/c mice. thus, we constructed the alpha-msh-secreting lactobacillus casei by the basic plasmid, pluat-ss, which was composed of a pldhutls promoter and alpha-amylase signal sequence from streptococcus bovis strain. acute colitis was induced by oral administration of 5% dss in drinking water for 7 days. to investigate the effect of l. casei-alpha-msh on the colitis, l. casei or l. casei-alpha-msh was orally administered for 7 days and their effects on body weight, mortality rate,  cytokine production, and tissue myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity were observed. administration of l. casei-alpha-msh reduced the symptom of acute colitis as assessed by body weight loss (dss alone: 14.45+/-0. 2 g; l. casei-alpha- msh: 18.2+/-0.12 g), colitis score (dss alone: 3.6+/-0.4; l. casei-alpha-msh: 1.4+/-0.6), mpo activity (dss alone: 42.7+/-4.5 u/g; l. casei-alpha-msh: 10.25+/-0.5 u/g), survival rate, and histological damage compared with the dss alone mice. l. casei-alpha-msh-administered entire colon showed reduced in vitro  production of proinflammatory cytokines and nf-kappab activation. the alpha-msh-secreting recombinant l. casei showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in the murine model of acute colitis and suggests a potential therapeutic role for this agent in clinical inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == new strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (sbd) of the *-amylase of streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in escherichia  coli. the fusion protein (cph-sbd) was able to bind to the cell surface of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441 and to corn starch. therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. at a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of l. casei did not form any  aggregates with corn starch. after incubation in simulated gastric juice (ph 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. when cph-sbd-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. the survival of the amylose-coated cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of cph-sbd-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. these  results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.

TI  == system using tandem repeats of the ca peptidoglycan-binding domain from lactococcus lactis for display of both n- and c-terminal fusions on cell surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == here, we established a system for displaying heterologous protein to the c terminus of the peptidoglycan-binding domain (ca domain) of acma (a major autolysin from lactococcus lactis). western blot and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the fusion proteins (ca-amya) of the ca domain and alpha-amylase from streptococcus bovis 148 (amya) are efficiently expressed and successfully displayed on the surfaces of l. lactis cells. amya was also displayed on the cell surface while retaining its activity. moreover, with an increase in the number of ca domains, the quantity of ca-amya fusion proteins displayed on the cell surface increased. when three repeats of the ca domain were used as an anchor protein, 82% of alpha-amylase activity was detected on the cells. the raw starch-degrading activity of amya was significantly higher when amya was fused to the c terminus of the ca domain than when it was fused to the n terminus. in addition, ca-amya fusion proteins were successfully displayed on the cell surfaces of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei.

TI  == display of alpha-amylase on the surface of lactobacillus casei cells by use of the pgsa anchor protein, and production of lactic acid from starch.
AB  == we developed a new cell surface engineering system based on the pgsa anchor protein from bacillus subtilis. in this system, the n terminus of the target protein was fused to the pgsa protein and the resulting fusion protein was expressed on the cell surface. using this new system, we constructed a novel starch-degrading strain of lactobacillus casei by genetically displaying alpha-amylase from the streptococcus bovis strain 148 with a flag peptide tag (amyaf). localization of the pgsa-amya-flag fusion protein on the cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. the  lactic acid bacteria which displayed amyaf showed significantly elevated hydrolytic activity toward soluble starch. by fermentation using amyaf-displaying l. casei cells, 50 g/liter of soluble starch was reduced to 13.7 g/liter, and 21.8 g/liter of lactic acid was produced within about 24 h. the yield in terms of grams of lactic acid produced per gram of carbohydrate utilized was 0.60 g per g  of carbohydrate consumed at 24 h. since amya was immobilized on the cells, cells  were recovered after fermentation and used repeatedly. during repeated utilization of cells, the lactic acid yield was improved to 0.81 g per g of carbohydrate consumed at 72 h. these results indicate that efficient simultaneous saccharification and fermentation from soluble starch to lactic acid were carried out by recombinant l. casei cells with cell surface display of amya.

TI  == detection and localization of peptidases in lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine.
AB  == the antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, and bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 as an indicator bacterium. each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. the milk cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus la 106 (la2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by lb. acidophilus la 106 (la2) during  incubation were also examined using n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.

TI  == factors affecting the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in rumen fluid.
AB  == 1. the cellular proteins of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, lactobacillus casei, megasphaera elsdenii, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were labelled by growth in the presence of l-[14c]leucine, and the breakdown of labelled protein was measured in incubations of these bacteria with rumen fluid to which unlabelled 5 mm-l-leucine was added. the rate of protein breakdown was estimated from the rate of release of radioactivity into acid-soluble material. 2. protein breakdown occurred at different rates in different species. the mean rates for b. fibrisolvens, l. casei, m. elsdenii, sel. ruminantium and str. bovis were 28.6, 18.1, 17.7, 10.5 and 5.3%/h respectively in samples of strained rumen  fluid (srf) with different protozoal populations. rates of 3%/h or less were found in srf from ciliate-free sheep or in faunated srf from which protozoa had been removed by centrifugation. further removal of mixed rumen bacteria had little effect. suspensions of washed protozoa degraded bacterial protein at rates which were of the same order as those found in srf. 3. the rate of breakdown of bacterial protein in different samples of srf tended to increase as the numbers of small entodiniomorphid protozoa increased. the numbers of larger entodiniomorphs and holotrichs had no obvious influence on this rate. 4. autoclaved and u.v.-treated bacteria were generally no different from live bacteria in their susceptibility to breakdown in srf from faunated sheep, indicating that endogenous protein turnover was not a significant cause of bacterial protein catabolism. 5. the rate of bacterial protein breakdown was unrelated to the proteolytic activity of srf. 6. it was concluded that predation  by small protozoa is by far the most important cause of bacterial protein turnover in the rumen, with autolysis, other lytic factors and endogenous proteolysis being of minor importance.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == [lactobacilli of freshwater fishes].
AB  == normal microflora in the intestinal tract of fishes inhabiting fresh-water reservoirs includes lactic bacteria. the number of the bacteria depends on the animal species, the composition of food, the age, and the season. the highest number of these microorganisms (hundreds of millions per gram of the intestinal content) is found in carps. enterococci are most often encountered in fishes inhabiting ponds: streptococcus faecalis andrewes a. horder, str. faecium orla-jensen, str. bovis orla-jensen. lactobacilli are more typical of fishes in water reserviors: lactobacillus plantarum (orla-jensen) bergey et al., l. casei (orla-jensen) hansen a. lessel, l. casei var. casei, l. casei var. rhamnosus, l.  casei var. alactosus, l. leichmannii (henneberg) bergey et al., l. acidophillus (moro) hansen a. mocquot, l. fermenti beijerinck, l. cellobiosus rogosa et al., l. buchneri (henneberg) bergey et al. the content of lactic bacteria varies in water reservoirs; their highest content is found in ooze (tens of thousands per gram).
