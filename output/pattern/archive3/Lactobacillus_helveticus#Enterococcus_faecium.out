screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.
a soy-based product fermented by enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus helveticus inhibits the development of murine breast adenocarcinoma.
purpose: soy and its fermented products are considered functional foods. the study objective was to assess three functional food - a non-fermented soy product (nfp), fermented soy product (fsp), fermented soy product enriched with isoflavones (fi) - in terms of their ability to reduce the development of adenocarcinoma in mice, as well their ability on modulating immune system. methods: it was observed tumor volume and to verify correlations with the immune system it was measured levels of the cytokines il-1beta and tnf-alpha produced by macrophages as well as ifn-gamma produced by lymphocytes using elisa test, and nitric oxide production by macrophages using griess reagent. results: all products showed immunological activity, but fsp showed the most effective tumor containment, resulting in smallest tumor volumes. fi animals expressed larger amounts of nitric oxide and il-1beta and exhibited larger tumor sizes than fsp and nfp animals. conclusions: the results suggested that the ingestion of fsp was most efficient in tumor containment, possibly due to a positive modulation of the immune system by when enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus helveticus are added to the soy product.
influence of a probiotic soy product on fecal microbiota and its association with cardiovascular risk factors in an animal model.
background: previous work showed that daily ingestion of an aqueous soy extract fermented with enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus 416, supplemented or not with isoflavones, reduced the total cholesterol and non-hdl-cholesterol levels, increased the high-density lipoprotein (hdl) concentration and inhibited the raising of autoantibody against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl ab) and the development of atherosclerotic lesions. objective: the aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbiota in order to investigate the possible correlation between fecal microbiota, serum lipid parameters and atherosclerotic lesion development in rabbits with induced hypercholesterolemia, that ingested the aqueous soy extract fermented with enterococcus faecium crl 183 and lactobacillus helveticus 416. methods: the rabbits were randomly allocated to five experimental groups (n = 6): control (c), hypercholesterolemic (h), hypercholesterolemic plus unfermented soy product (huf), hypercholesterolemic plus fermented soy product (hf) and hypercholesterolemic plus isoflavone-supplemented fermented soy product (hif). lipid parameters and microbiota composition were analyzed on days 0 and 60 of the treatment and the atherosclerotic lesions were quantified at the end of the experiment. the fecal microbiota was characterized by enumerating the lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., enterococcus spp., enterobacteria and clostridium spp. populations. results: after 60 days of the experiment, intake of the probiotic soy product was correlated with significant increases (p < 0.05) on lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp. and enterococcus spp. and a decrease in the enterobacteria population. a strong correlation was observed between microbiota composition and lipid profile. populations of enterococcus spp., lactobacillus spp. and bifidobacterium spp. were negatively correlated with total cholesterol, non-hdl-cholesterol, autoantibodies against oxidized ldl (oxldl ab) and lesion size. hdl-c levels were positively correlated with lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., and enterococcus spp. populations. conclusion: in conclusion, daily ingestion of the probiotic soy product, supplemented or not with isoflavones, may contribute to a beneficial balance of the fecal microbiota and this modulation is associated with an improved cholesterol profile and inhibition of atherosclerotic lesion development.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
