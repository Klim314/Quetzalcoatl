TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.
