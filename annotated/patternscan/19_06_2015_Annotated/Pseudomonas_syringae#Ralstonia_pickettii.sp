TI  == effects of bovine milk lactoperoxidase system on some bacteria.
AB  == bovine lactoperoxidase (lpo) was purified from skimmed milk using amberlite cg-50-h+ resin, cm sephadex c-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex g-100  gel filtration chromatography. lactoperoxidase was purified 20.45-fold with a yield of 28.8%. purity of enzyme checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method and a single band was observed. km was 0.25 mm at 20 degrees c, vmax value was 7.95 micromol/ml min at  20 degrees c (ph 6.0). antibacterial study was done by disk diffusion method of kir-by-bauer using mueller-hinton agar medium with slight modification. bovine lpo showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mm thiocyanate-100 mm h2o2 medium for some bacteria (brevibacillus centrosaurus, b. choshinensis, b. lyticum, cedecea davisae, chryseobacterium indoltheticum, clavibacter michiganense pv. insidiosum, kocuria erythromyxa, k. kristinae, k. rosea, k. varians, paenibacillus validus, pseudomonas syringae pv. populans, ralstonia pickettii, rhodococcus wratislaviensis, serratia fonticola, streptomyces violaceusniger, vibrio cholerae-nono1) respectively, and compared with well known antibacterial substances (levofloxacin, netilmicin). lpo system has inhibition effects on all type bacteria and concentration is really important such as lpo-100 mm thiocyanate-100 mm h2o2 system was proposed as an effective agent against many factors causing several diseases.
