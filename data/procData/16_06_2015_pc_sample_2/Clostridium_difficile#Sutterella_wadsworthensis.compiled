TI  - Activity of a novel carbapenem, doripenem, against anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Doripenem, a synthetic 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, has a broad-spectrum of activity against almost all species of anaerobic bacteria, including all Bacteroides fragilis group species, most with MIC(90) results at <or=1 microg/mL (with the exception of Sutterella wadsworthensis). Against Clostridium difficile strains, it has a narrow range of inhibitory concentrations (1-4 microg/mL) that "may be achievable in the colon", potentially resulting in lower disease rates. It has been shown to be active in vitro against strains isolated from a variety of clinical infections, including bacteremias, diabetic foot and other soft tissues infections and in intra-abdominal and pelvic sites. In addition, a study of a pyometrium animal model of mixed infections noted a better microbiologic response than with imipenem. Two phase 3 multinational clinical trials of complicated mixed aerobic/anaerobic intra-abdominal infections noted "noninferiority" of doripenem when compared with meropenem, but in vitro against the anaerobes, it was "more potent than meropenem, ertapenem, ... and similar to imipenem". Doripenem activity against anaerobes seems comparable with the other extant carbapenems. Although resistance among anaerobic bacteria to this agent is possible, it remains relatively rare.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
