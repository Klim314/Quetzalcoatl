TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == construction of new cloning, lacz reporter and scarless-markerless suicide vectors for genetic studies in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == to elucidate the putative function of a gene, effective tools are required for genetic characterization that facilitate its inactivation, deletion or modification on the bacterial chromosome. in the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the escherichia coli/aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans shuttle vector pygk was determined, allowing us to redesign and construct a new shuttle cloning vector, pjt4, and promoterless lacz transcriptional/translational fusion  plasmids, pjt3 and pjt5. plasmids pjt4 and pjt5 contain the origin of replication necessary to maintain shuttle vector replication. in addition, a new suicide vector, pjt1, was constructed for the generation of scarless and markerless deletion mutations of genes in the oral pathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans. plasmid pjt1 is a puc-based suicide vector that is counter-selectable for sucrose sensitivity. this vector does not leave antibiotic markers or scars on the chromosome after gene deletion and thus provides the option to combine several mutations in the same genetic background. the effectiveness of pjt1 was demonstrated by the construction of a. actinomycetemcomitans isogenic qseb single deletion (deltaqseb) mutant and lsrrk double deletion mutants (deltalsrrk). these new vectors may offer alternatives for genetic studies in a. actinomycetemcomitans and other members of the hacek (haemophilus spp., a. actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae) group of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == actinobacillus endocarditis associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
AB  == infective endocarditis can be associated with complex clinical presentations, sometimes with a difficult multi-disciplinary management. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans belongs to the haemophilus species, actinomycetemcomitans,  cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella species group, responsible for 5% to 10% of infective endocarditis in native heart valves. these organisms have slow fastidious growth pattern, often associated with negative cultures, and cause systemic embolism with abscess formation. the authors present the case of a 59-year-old man, admitted due to fever of unknown origin, with a personal history of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and recent dental manipulation. the diagnosis of mitral valve's endocarditis was established after  a transoesophageal ecocardiography, with a late isolation of a actinomycetemcomitans in blood culture. despite the institution of antibiotic therapy, the patient suffered from multiple episodes of septic embolism: skin, mucosae, cerebral abscesses, spondylodiscitis and uveitis. he was submitted to heart surgery with miectomy and replacement of the native mitral valve by a mechanical prosthesis, while on antibiotics.

TI  == kingella kingae endocarditis: a rare case of mitral valve perforation.
AB  == kingella kingae, a hacek (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae) organism, is a common resident of the upper airway in children; it has been associated with endocarditis in children with pre-existing heart conditions. this case report describes k. kingae endocarditis  leading to valvular damage in a previously healthy 18-month-old child. our patient developed a k. kingae bacteremia that was later complicated by meningitis, septic embolic stroke, and endocarditis of the mitral valve, leading  to perforation of the posterolateral leaflet. the patient was initially treated conservatively with cefotaxime but, subsequently, required a mitral valve repair  with a pericardial patch and annuloplasty. this report draws attention to the need for clinicians to be aware of the potentially serious complications of k. kingae infection in young children. if k. kingae infection is suspected then therapy should be initiated promptly with a beta-lactam, followed by early echocardiographic assessment. this case also highlights the lack of specific guidelines available for k. kingae endocarditis.

TI  == identification of hacek clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. we assessed this technology for the identification of 103 haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae (hacek) clinical isolates and 20 haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. ninety-three percent of hacek organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.

TI  == [endocarditis due to aggregatibacter (formerly: actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, a bacterium that grows in characteristic star-shaped colonies].
AB  == a 72-year-old man, having had an artificial valve for almost 20 years now, presented with tiredness that had persisted for several weeks and reported weight loss of 5 kg. in more recent days he experienced fever and cold shivers, and an associated dry cough. bearing in mind the potential for endocarditis, blood cultures were grown. in this, we identified a small, gram-negative rod with a small, smooth, raised colony that grew slowly. we considered a micro-organism from the 'hacek group', which is a group of micro-organisms including haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae and aggregatibacter (formerly: actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans. more careful observation revealed that the bacteria formed star-shaped colonies, proving that a. actinomycetemcomitans was the cause of this non-acute endocarditis. the patient received antibiotic treatment. because non-acute endocarditis is often caused by hidden abnormalities in the mouth or teeth and a. actinomycetemcomitans plays an important role in severe cases of peridontitis, a dental surgeon was consulted. the dental surgeon diagnosed multifocal peridontitis and treated the patient, who was able to leave the hospital after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis caused by hacek microorganism.
AB  == purpose: to report a case of bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis caused by a hacek group organism (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans). methods: an 85-year-old caucasian female presented with bilateral light perception visual acuity, anterior chamber cells, hypopyon, posterior synechiae, and no red reflex. results: the patient underwent bilateral vitrectomy, with topical, intravitreal,  and systemic antibiotics. vitreous cultures revealed gram-negative cocco bacilli  consistent with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. at final follow-up, visual  acuity was 20/25 re and 20/40 le. conclusions: prompt diagnosis and treatment of  hacek [hemophilus sp. (parainfluenzae, aphrophilus, paraphrophilus), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corodens, and kingella kingae] group bacterial endophthalmitis can yield good results.

TI  == hacek group endocarditis at the riyadh armed forces hospital.
AB  == introduction: fastidious gram-negative organisms classified as the hacek group (haemophilus spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella spp.) are rare causes of infective endocarditis. case report: in this series, we report six cases of endocarditis in saudi patients occurring between 1990 and 1994 in our hospital, caused by two of the organisms in the hacek group, i.e. cardiobacterium hominis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the clinical features, predisposing factors and treatment  of the patients are briefly described. the microscopic and cultural characteristics of the organisms are described together with the laboratory methods of diagnosis. major findings: hacek endocarditis was frequently associated with prosthetic heart valves or structural heart abnormalities. dental caries or periodontal disease seems to be a predisposing factor. the prognosis of hacek endocarditis is very good as clinical and bacteriological cure were achieved with antibiotic therapy in all our cases except one who required mitral  valve replacement. contrary to previous reports we did not find all the organisms sensitive to penicillin and aminoglycosides. however, all our isolates were sensitive to amoxycillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. conclusions: laboratory diagnosis of hacek group of organisms requires a high index of suspicion and should be suspected in cases of endocarditis in which fastidious gram-negative coccobacilli are isolated which fail to grow on macconkey agar. empiric therapy should be started in suspected cases with second generation cephalosporins or with ciprofloxacin, until antibiotic sensitivity results become available. antibiotic therapy should be continued for 4-6 weeks. progress and outcome was very good in the series.
