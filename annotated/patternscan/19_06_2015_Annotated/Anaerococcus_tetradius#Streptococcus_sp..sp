TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == changes in gastric and lung microflora with acid suppression: acid suppression and bacterial growth.
AB  == importance: the use of acid suppression has been associated with an increased risk of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in the outpatient setting but the mechanism behind this increased risk is unknown. we hypothesize that this infection risk results from gastric bacterial overgrowth with subsequent seeding  of the lungs. objectives: to determine if acid-suppression use results in gastric bacterial overgrowth, if there are changes in lung microflora associated with the use of acid suppression, and if changes in lung microflora are related to full-column nonacid gastroesophageal reflux. design, setting, and participants: a 5-year prospective cohort study at a tertiary care center where children ages 1 to 18 years were undergoing bronchoscopy and endoscopy for the evaluation of chronic cough. acid-suppression use was assessed through questionnaires with confirmation using an electronic medical record review. main outcomes and measures: our primary outcome was to compare differences in concentration and prevalence of gastric and lung bacteria between patients who were and were not receiving acid-suppression therapy. we compared medians using the wilcoxon signed rank test and determined prevalence ratios using asymptotic standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. we determined correlations between continuous variables using pearson correlation coefficients and compared categorical variables using the fisher exact test. results: forty-six percent of patients taking acid-suppression medication had gastric bacterial growth compared with 18% of untreated patients (p = .003). staphylococcus (prevalence ratio, 12.75 [95% ci, 1.72-94.36]), streptococcus (prevalence ratio, 6.91 [95% ci, 1.64-29.02]), veillonella (prevalence ratio, 9.56 [95% ci, 1.26-72.67]), dermabacter (prevalence ratio, 4.78 [95% ci, 1.09-21.02]), and rothia (prevalence ratio, 6.38 [95% ci, 1.50-27.02]) were found more commonly in the gastric fluid of treated patients. the median bacterial concentration was higher in treated patients than  in untreated patients (p = .001). there was no difference in the prevalence (p >  .23) of different bacterial genera or the median concentration of total bacteria  (p = .85) in the lungs between treated and untreated patients. there were significant positive correlations between proximal nonacid reflux burden and lung concentrations of bacillus (r = 0.47, p = .005), dermabacter (r = 0.37, p = .008), lactobacillus (r = 0.45, p = .001), peptostreptococcus (r = 0.37, p = .008), and capnocytophagia (r = 0.37, p = .008). conclusions and relevance: acid-suppression use results in gastric bacterial overgrowth of genera including  staphylococcus and streptococcus. full-column nonacid reflux is associated with greater concentrations of bacteria in the lung. additional studies are needed to  determine if acid suppression-related microflora changes predict clinical infection risk; these results suggest that acid suppression use may need to be limited in patients at risk for infections.

TI  == profiling of the bacteria responsible for pyogenic liver abscess by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing.
AB  == pyogenic liver abscess (pla) is a severe disease with considerable mortality and  is often polymicrobial. understanding the pathogens that cause pla is the basis for pla treatment. here, we profiled the bacterial composition in pla fluid by pyrosequencing the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene based on next-generation sequencing (ngs) technology to identify etiological agents of pla and to provide  information of their 16s rrna sequences for application to dna-based techniques in the hospital. twenty patients with pla who underwent percutaneous catheter drainage, abscess culture, and blood culture for isolates were included. genomic  dnas from abscess fluids were subjected to polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene with a 454 gs junior system. the abscess and  blood cultures were positive in nine (45%) and four (20%) patients, respectively. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene showed that 90% of the pla fluid samples contained single or multiple genera of known bacteria such as klebsiella, fusobacterium, streptococcus, bacteroides, prevotella, peptostreptococcus, unassigned enterobacteriaceae, and dialister. klebsiella was predominantly found  in the pla fluid samples. all samples that carried unassigned bacteria had 26.8%  reads on average. we demonstrated that the occurrence of pla was associated with  eight known bacterial genera as well as unassigned bacteria and that 16s rrna gene sequencing was more useful than conventional culture methods for accurate identification of bacterial pathogens from pla.

TI  == efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in japanese  women.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of pid that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once  daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 japanese women with acute pid. the clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on days 15 and 29. the most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were c. trachomatis (12 strains), prevotella bivia (10 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). the clinical success rate on day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). the clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. all adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for pid caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. the therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of pid in japanese women. registration number: nct00871494.

TI  == a safe and practical decontamination method to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of ultrasound transducers.
AB  == purpose: hospital-acquired infections is a major concern affecting patient management, in which medical instruments and devices play an important role. the  purpose of this study was to determine the degree of bacterial contamination of the sonographic probe and describe an effective, safe, and practical decontamination method. methods: the study's sample consisted of 50 patients. cultures were taken from the probe surface both after each examination and after  the probes had been wiped clean with a dry, nonsterile paper towel. cultures were also taken randomly from the coupling gel. results: initial cultures were positive in 49 cases (98%) for aerobic and in 26 cases (52%) for anaerobic bacteria. cultures obtained after cleaning the probe were positive in only 21 cases (42%) for aerobic and in 12 cases (24%) for anaerobic bacteria. the most common bacteria isolated in the aerobic cultures were streptococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and in the anaerobic cultures were peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. all cultures taken from the coupling gel were negative. conclusions: sonographic probes may act as a medium for bacterial contamination and transmission. cleaning of the probe with a dry, nonsterile paper towel is an easy, effective, low-cost, and device-friendly method that can  reduce this risk.

TI  == an antibacterial metabolite from lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae f2.
AB  == in searching for symbionts derived from bioactive natural products, six sulfureous diketopiperazines designated as lasiodiplines a-f (1-6) were characterized from the culture of lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae f2, previously residing in the apparently normal flower of illigera rhodantha (hernandiaceae). identification of structures was accomplished by a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches, in conjunction with the low-temperature (100k) single-crystal x-ray diffraction with cu kalpha radiation. lasiodipline e (5) was demonstrated to be antibacterial against the clinical strains streptococcus sp.,  bacteroides vulgates, peptostreptococcus sp. and veillonella parvula, respectively, with an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.12-0.25 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 4 and 6 exemplify two unusual architectures of natural cyclodipeptides, signifying the unique biochemical characteristics of the producing fungus.

TI  == tricomponent complex loaded with a mosquito-stage antigen of the malaria parasite induces potent transmission-blocking immunity.
AB  == the development of malaria vaccines is challenging, partly because the immunogenicity of recombinant malaria parasite antigens is low. we previously demonstrated that parasite antigens integrated into a tricomponent immunopotentiating complex increase antiparasitic immunity. in this study, the b  domains of a group g streptococcus (spg) strain and peptostreptococcus magnus (ppl) were used to evaluate whether vaccine efficacy is influenced by the type of immunoglobulin-binding domain (ibd) in the tricomponent complex. ibds were fused  to a pentameric cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (comp) to increase the binding avidity of the complexes for their targets. the comp-ibd fusion proteins  generated (comp-spg and comp-ppl and the previously constructed comp-z) bound a large fraction of splenic b lymphocytes but not t lymphocytes. these carrier molecules were then loaded with an ookinete surface protein of plasmodium vivax,  pvs25, by chemical conjugation. the administration of the tricomponent complexes  to mice induced more pvs25-specific serum igg than did the unloaded antigen. the  ppl complex, which exhibited a broad ig-binding spectrum, conferred higher vaccine efficacy than did the z or spg complexes when evaluated with a membrane feed assay. this study demonstrates that this tricomponent immunopotentiating system, incorporating ibds as the b-lymphocyte-targeting ligands, is a promising  technology for the delivery of malaria vaccines, particularly when combined with  an aluminum salt adjuvant.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

TI  == descending necrotizing mediastinitis: a modified algorithmic approach to define a new standard of care.
AB  == background: descending necrotizing mediastinitis (dnm) is a highly morbid infectious process. this uncommon disease process has carried historically a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. in this study we hypothesized that application of a prospective modified management algorithm would decrease the morbidity and mortality from this highly destructive process. methods: we developed a systematic approach for managing dnm, focusing on serial debridement  guided by imaging, in conjunction with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and  modern principles of critical care. we reviewed all patients admitted with this disease process from 2007-2012. data collected included demographic information,  co-morbidities, laboratory data including culture results, operative details, imaging frequency and findings, complications, and survival. continuous variables were reported as median values and ranges. results: from 2007-2010, we treated eight patients with dnm. the median age of the patients was 33 y (range 28-63 y), and 63% were male. in accordance with our algorithm, the patients underwent serial imaging at regular intervals following operative debridement. the median number of imaging studies was 11 (range 4-19). the patients required a median of  five operative debridements (range 1-15). in five patients, drainage was necessary through a cervical exploration. a thoracic approach was required in six patients (two thoracoscopic, four via thoracotomy). additional procedures included thymectomy (n=2), anterior mediastinotomy, carotid sheath exploration and resections of the clavicle, first rib, manubrium, pectoralis major muscle, and sternocleidomastoid muscle. the most common etiologic agents were peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus anginosus. study patients received a median of six different antibiotics (range 2-10) for a total of 42 d (range 34-55 d). these patients were hospitalized for a median of 29 days (range 16-56 d), with 15 d (range 7-48 d) spent in the intensive care unit. remarkably, the rate of survival was 100% (median follow-up of 33 mo). the patients developed no major complications, required no re-admissions, and had no re-infections. conclusions:  we applied an algorithmic approach to the treatment of dnm, consisting of aggressive operative debridement and enhanced by equally aggressive imaging. our  patients had excellent outcomes despite the widely known lethality of dnm. an aggressive approach may decrease complications and improve survival in this devastating disease process. furthermore, our prospective experience with dnm suggests that this algorithm used in the present study should be the standard for managing patients with this challenging condition.

TI  == diagnosis of gas gangrene: does a discrepancy exist between the published data and practice.
AB  == the infectious disease society of america has defined gas gangrene as an infection caused by clostridium species. however, in many clinical settings, soft tissue infections that produce subcutaneous gas have been diagnosed as gas gangrene without identification of the presence of clostridium species. instead,  the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic findings. a chart review was performed of 25 consecutive patients treated at the atlantic health system for infections of the lower extremity that were diagnosed as gas gangrene. wound cultures from the 25 patients grew 31 different species of bacteria. the most prevalent organism was staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 17 of 31 (54.84%) different organisms identified and 19.77% of 86 separate aerobic or anaerobic cultures. the most prevalent genus was streptococcus, which accounted for 20 (64.52%) of the organisms identified and 23.26% of the cultures. the most  prevalent anaerobic genus was peptostreptococcus, which accounted for 8 (25.81%)  of the organisms identified and 9.3% of the cultures. none of the cultures grew clostridium species. these findings showed that gas-forming soft tissue infections of the lower extremity, commonly diagnosed as gas gangrene, are rarely caused by clostridium species.

TI  == microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  == noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries.  in an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16s  rrna gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing  gingivitis (ang) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. our observations raise doubts about fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably atopobium spp., prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus anginosus. on the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas spp. and fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ang microbiota supports the hypothesis that ang might be the  immediate step preceding noma.

TI  == alteration of digestive tract microbiome in neonatal holstein bull calves by bacitracin methylene disalicylate treatment and scours.
AB  == the effects of bacitracin methylene disalicylate (bmd) and scours on the fecal microbiome, animal performance, and health were studied in holstein bull calves.  holstein bull calves (n = 150) were obtained from a single source at 12 to 24 h of age. bull calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments including con (no bmd; n = 75 calves) and bmd (n = 75 calves). starting 3 d after arrival, bmd was  added into milk replacer (0.5 g/feeding; twice daily) and fed to the calves for 10 consecutive d. no differences (p > 0.10) were observed in adg for d 0 to 28 and d 0 to 56, dmi for d 0 to 28, d 29 to 56, and d 0 to 56, or g:f for d 0 to 28, d 29 to 56, and d 0 to 56; adg for d 29 to 56 tended to increase (p < 0.10) for bmd-treated calves compared with controls. fecal samples were collected from  15 scouring calves and 10 cohorts (nonscouring calves received on the same day and administered the same treatment as the scouring calves). animal morbidity and fecal score did not vary between the 2 treatments. mortality was not influenced by the treatments in the bmd administration period or throughout the experiment.  fecal samples were subjected to pyrotagged 454 flx pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicon to examine compositional dynamics of fecal microbes. escherichia, enterococcus, and shigella had greater (p < 0.05) populations in the bmd group whereas dorea, roseburia, fecalibacterium, papillibacter, collinsella, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, and prevotella were decreased (p < 0.05) by bmd  treatment. genus populations were also compared between scouring and nonscouring  calves. streptococcus was the only genus that had notable increase (p < 0.05) in  fecal samples from scouring calves whereas populations of bacteroides, roseburia, and eubacterium were markedly (p < 0.05) greater in nonscouring calves. these results show that bmd has the ability to alter the composition of the fecal microbiome but failed to improve performance in holstein bull calves. discrepancy of microorganism profiles between scouring and nonscouring calves might be associated with the occurrence of scours and bacterial genera identified might be potential target of treating diarrhea.

TI  == a consortium of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a  longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == regioselective covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody-binding proteins a, g, and l for construction of antibody arrays.
AB  == immobilized antibodies are useful for the detection of antigens in highly sensitive microarray diagnostic applications. arrays with the antibodies attached regioselectively in a uniform orientation are typically more sensitive than those with random orientations. direct regioselective immobilization of antibodies on a solid support typically requires a modified form of the protein. we now report a  general approach for the regioselective attachment of antibodies to a surface using truncated forms of antibody-binding proteins a, g, and l that retain the structural motifs required for antibody binding. the recombinant proteins have a  c-terminal cvix protein farnesyltransferase recognition motif that allows us to append a bioorthogonal azide or alkyne moiety and use the cu(i)-catalyzed huisgen cycloaddition to attach the binding proteins to a suitably modified glass surface. this approach offers several advantages. the recombinant antibody-binding proteins are produced in escherichia coli, chemoselectively modified posttranslationally in the cell-free homogenate, and directly attached to the glass surface without the need for purification at any stage of the process. complexes between immobilized recombinant proteins a, g, and l and their respective strongly bound antibodies were stable to repeated washing with pbst buffer at ph 7.2. however, the antibodies could be stripped from the slides by treatment with 0.1 m glycine.hcl buffer, ph 2.6, for 30 min and regenerated by shaking with pbs buffer, ph 7.2, at 4 degrees c overnight. the recombinant forms  of proteins a, g, and l can be used separately or in combination to give glass surfaces capable of binding a wide variety of antibodies.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == incorporating into a calpha go model the effects of geometrical restriction on calpha atoms caused by side chain orientations.
AB  == coarse-grained go models have been widely used for studying protein-folding mechanisms. despite the simplicity of the model, these can reproduce the essential features of the folding process of a protein. however, it is also known that side chains significantly contribute to the folding mechanism. hence, it is  desirable to incorporate the side chain effects into a coarse-grained go model. in this study, to distinguish the effects of side chain orientation and to understand how these effects contribute to folding mechanisms, we incorporate into a calpha go model not only heterogeneous contact energies but also geometrical restraints around two calpha atoms in contact with each other. we confirm that the heterogeneity of contact energies governs the folding pathway of a protein and that the geometric constraints attributed to side chains reproduce  cooperative transitions in folding.

AB  == describing the biogeography of bacterial communities within the human body is critical for establishing healthy baselines from which to detect differences associated with diseases. little is known, however, about the baseline of normal  salivary microbiota from healthy chinese children and adults. with parallel barcoded 454 pyrosequencing, the bacterial diversity and richness of saliva were  thoroughly investigated from ten healthy chinese children and adults. the overall taxonomic distribution of our metagenomic data demonstrated that the diversity of salivary microbiota from children was more complex than adults, while the composition and richness of salivary microbiota were similar in children and adults, especially for predominant bacteria. a large number of bacterial phylotypes were shared by healthy children and adults, indicating the existence of a core salivary microbiome. in children and adults, the vast majority of sequences in salivary microbiota belonged to streptococcus, prevotella, neisseria, haemophilus, porphyromonas, gemella, rothia, granulicatella, fusobacterium, actinomyces, veillonella, and aggregatibacter, which constituted the major components of normal salivary microbiota. with the exception of actinomyces, the other seven non-predominant bacteria including moraxella, leptotrichia, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, and members of neisseriaceae, flavobacteriaceae, and sr1 showed significant differences between children and adults (p < 0.05). we first established the framework of normal salivary microbiota from healthy chinese children and adults. our data represent a critical step for determining the diversity of healthy microbiota in chinese children and adults, and our data established a platform for additional large-scale studies focusing on the interactions between health and diseases in the future.

TI  == separation of antigens and antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography.
AB  == context: affinity chromatography is an efficient antibody, antigen and protein separation method based on the interaction between specific immobilized ligands and target antibody, antigen, and so on. populations of available ligands can be  used to separate antibodies or their fab fragments. similarly, antigens can be isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (iac) on immobilized antibodies of low  affinity. objective: this review describes the advantages, the applications, as well as the drawbacks, of iac in the separation and purification of antibodies and antigens. methods: the present review discussed all types of purification and isolation of antibodies and antigens by iac, including purification of antibodies using immobilized and synthetic mimic proteins a, g and l; isolation of fab fragments of antibodies; separation of antibodies against different antigen forms; isolation of antigens by immobilized antibodies and so on. these methods come from over 60 references compiled from all major databases. results: purification of antigens with antibodies should choose low-affinity antibodies to avoid denaturation of most proteins. concern for cost and safety, prompted research activities focused on novel synthetic ligands with improved properties such as lower cost, avoidance of the risk of contamination associated with natural ligands of human or animal origin to isolate antibodies and antigens. conclusion: it is anticipated that the improvements of iac will have impact not only on large-scale production of antibodies but also on the generation of new affinity-based methods for the increasing number of proteins and antibody derivatives available by protein engineering and the proteomics revolution.

TI  == host-bacterial interactions during induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis in current smokers.
AB  == background: changes in clinical profiles, microbial succession, and immune mediator fluctuations have all been separately examined during onset and resolution of experimental gingivitis in smokers. however, because both the bacterial challenge and the host response contribute to periodontal disease, the  purpose of this investigation is to simultaneously examine clinical, bacterial, and immune changes that occur during the onset and resolution of disease in smokers. methods: experimental gingivitis was induced in 15 smokers for 21 days,  followed by treatment with a sonic toothbrush for 21 days. marginal and subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected at baseline; after 7, 14, and 21 days of undisturbed plaque formation; and 21 days after reinstitution of brushing. 16s cloning and sequencing was used for bacterial quantification, and multiplexed bead-based flow cytometry was used to quantify the levels of 27 immune mediators. results: onset of clinical gingivitis was preceded by significant changes in the marginal and subgingival biofilms, with a decrease in the abundance of early colonizers, namely, streptococcus, veillonella, and pseudomonas, and an increase in levels of periodontopathogens, such as treponema, selenomonas, parvimonas, dialister, and campylobacter. this was accompanied by a decrease in anti-inflammatory, chemokine, and t-helper 2 (th2) responses and altered th1/th2 ratios. although the bacterial communities continued to shift in the same direction after onset of clinical gingivitis and returned to baseline levels after resolution of disease, the anti-inflammatory, chemokine, and th2 profiles demonstrated an increase from day 14 that continued even after clinical health was evident. conclusion: both marginal and subgingival biofilms in smokers are characterized by early acquisition of pathogenic organisms, which elicit a sustained host response that persists even after removal of the bacterial challenge.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

TI  == extensive, non-healing scalp ulcer associated with trauma-induced chronic osteomyelitis.
AB  == a 77-year-old woman presented with a trauma to the scalp caused from the blade of a windmill. the condition was persistent from the past 50 years. at the initial examination, a deep, foul-smelling and well-circumscribed ulcer was apparent on the head region, involving the majority of the cranium. skin biopsy specimens of  the lesion were nonspecific. the bone biopsy showed extensive necrotic areas of bone and soft tissues, with lymphocytic exudate foci. a computed tomography scan  of the head revealed bone destruction principally involving both the parietal bones, and parts of the frontal and occipital bones. streptococcus parasanguis was isolated from the skin culture, and proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus  sp. were identified in the cultures from the bone. a long-term treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1 g/12 h) and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was prescribed, but even after 6 months, the lesion remained unchanged. the frequency of occurrence of scalp ulcers in dermatological patients is less, principally because of the rich blood supply to this area. we have not found any similar case report of a scalp ulcer secondary to chronic osteomyelitis discovered more than 50 years after the causal trauma. we want to highlight the importance of complete cutaneous evaluation including skin and bone biopsies, when scalp osteomyelitis is suspected.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == protein l: a novel reagent for the detection of chimeric antigen receptor (car) expression by flow cytometry.
AB  == background: there has been significant progress in the last two decades on the design of chimeric antigen receptors (car) for adoptive immunotherapy targeting tumor-associated antigens. structurally cars consist of a single chain antibody fragment directed against a tumor-associated antigen fused to an extracellular spacer and transmembrane domain followed by t cell cytoplasmic signaling moieties. currently several clinical trials are underway using gene modified peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) with cars directed against a variety of tumor  associated antigens. despite the improvements in the design of cars and expansion of the number of target antigens, there is no universal flow cytometric method available to detect the expression of cars on the surface of transduced lymphocytes. methods: currently anti-fragment antigen binding (fab) conjugates are most widely used to determine the expression of cars on gene-modified lymphocytes by flow cytometry. the limitations of these reagents are that many of them are not commercially available, generally they are polyclonal antibodies and often the results are inconsistent. in an effort to develop a simple universal flow cytometric method to detect the expression of cars, we employed protein l to determine the expression of cars on transduced lymphocytes. protein l is an immunoglobulin (ig)-binding protein that binds to the variable light chains (kappa chain) of ig without interfering with antigen binding site. protein l binds to most classes of ig and also binds to single-chain antibody fragments (scfv) and fab fragments. results: we used cars derived from both human and murine antibodies to validate this novel protein l based flow cytometric method and the results correlated well with other established methods. activated human pbls were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing two human antibody based  cars (anti-egfrviii, and anti-vegfr2), two murine antibody derived cars (anti-cspg4, and anti-cd19), and two humanized mouse antibody based cars (anti-erbb2, and anti-psca). transduced cells were stained first with biotin labeled protein l followed by phycoerythrin (pe)-conjugated streptavidin (sa) and analyzed by flow cytometry. for comparison, cells were stained in parallel with biotin conjugated goat-anti-mouse fab or car specific fusion proteins. using protein l, all car transduced lymphocytes exhibited specific staining pattern ranging from 40 to 80% of positive cells (compared to untransduced cells) and staining was comparable to the pattern observed with anti-fab antibodies. conclusion: our data demonstrate the feasibility of employing protein l as a general reagent for the detection of car expression on transduced lymphocytes by  flow cytometry.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == defining the "core microbiome" of the microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == background: porcine tonsils are the colonization site for many pathogenic as well as commensal microorganisms and are the primary lymphoid tissue encountered by organisms entering through the mouth or nares. the goal of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of the composition and structure of the tonsillar microbial communities and to define the core microbiome in the tonsils  of healthy pigs, using high throughput bar-coded 454-flx pyrosequencing. results: whole tonsils were collected at necropsy from 12 16-week-old finisher pigs from two healthy herds. tonsil brushes were also used to collect samples from four of  these animals. bacterial dna was isolated from each sample, amplified by pcr with universal primers specific for the bacterial 16s rrna genes, and the pcr products sequenced using pyrosequencing. an average of 13,000 sequences were generated from each sample. microbial community members were identified by sequence comparison to known bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences.the microbiomes of these healthy herds showed very strong similarities in the major components as well as  distinct differences in minor components. pasteurellaceae dominated the tonsillar microbiome in all animals, comprising ~60% of the total, although the relative proportions of the genera actinobacillus, haemophilus, and pasteurella varied between the herds. also found in all animals were the genera alkanindiges, peptostreptococcus, veillonella, streptococcus and fusobacterium, as well as enterobacteriaceae and neisseriaceae. treponema and chlamydia were unique to herd 1, while arcanobacterium was unique to herd 2.tonsil brushes yielded similar results to tissue specimens, although enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobes were more frequently found in tissue than in brush samples, and chlamydia, an obligately intracellular organism, was not found in brush specimens. conclusions: we have extended and supported our previous studies with 16s clone libraries, using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing to describe the microbial communities in tonsils of healthy pigs. we have defined a core microbiome, dominated by pasteurellaceae, in tonsil specimens, and have also demonstrated the presence of  unique minor components of the tonsillar microbiome present in each herd. we have validated the use of non-invasive tonsil brushes, in comparison to tonsil tissue, which will facilitate future studies.

TI  == plasma half-life extension of small recombinant antibodies by fusion to immunoglobulin-binding domains.
AB  == many therapeutic proteins possessing a small size are rapidly cleared from circulation. half-life extension strategies have therefore become increasingly important to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of protein therapeutics. here, we performed a comparative analysis of the half-life  extension properties of various bacterial immunoglobulin-binding domains (igbds)  derived from staphylococcus protein a (spa), streptococcus protein g (spg), and finegoldia (formerly peptostreptococcus) protein l (ppl). these domains, composed of 50-60 amino acid residues, were fused to the c terminus of a single-chain fv and a bispecific single-chain diabody, respectively. all fusion proteins were produced in mammalian cells and retained their antigen-binding properties. the half-lives of the antibody molecules were prolonged to varying extents for the different igbds. the strongest effects in mice were observed for domain c3 of spg (spg(c3)) followed by domains b and d of spa, suggesting that spg(c3) is particularly useful to extend the plasma half-life of small proteins.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == enteral tube feeding alters the oral indigenous microbiota in elderly adults.
AB  == enteral tube feeding is widely used to maintain nutrition for elderly adults with eating difficulties, but its long-term use alters the environment of the oral ecosystem. this study characterized the tongue microbiota of tube-fed elderly adults by analyzing the 16s rrna gene. the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) profiles of 44 tube-fed subjects were compared with those of 54 subjects fed orally (average age, 86.4 +/- 6.9 years). bar-coded pyrosequencing data were also obtained for a subset of the subjects from each group (15 tube-fed subjects and 16 subjects fed orally). the t-rflp profiles demonstrated that the microbiota of the tube-fed subjects was distinct from that  of the subjects fed orally (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [permanova], p < 0.001). the pyrosequencing data revealed that 22 bacterial genera, including corynebacterium, peptostreptococcus, and fusobacterium, were significantly more predominant in tube-fed subjects, whereas the dominant genera  in the subjects fed orally, such as streptococcus and veillonella, were present in much lower proportions. opportunistic pathogens rarely detected in the normal  oral microbiota, such as corynebacterium striatum and streptococcus agalactiae, were often found in high proportions in tube-fed subjects. the oral indigenous microbiota is disrupted by the use of enteral feeding, allowing health-threatening bacteria to thrive.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. in this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from  chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus (27) and streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (31) and prevotella species (30). haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. overall, 22 % of staphylococcus aureus isolates  were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == salivary blood group antigens and microbial flora.
AB  == objective: secretor is an individual with ability to produce blood group reactive substances in the exocrine glands and to secrete these substances in the body fluids such as saliva. in saliva the blood reactive antigens are found primarily  on mucins which exhibit microheterogenicity and different subtypes of these molecules. this study was done to find out if the salivary blood group antigens have any role in the adherence of certain selected microorganism in the oral cavity. methods: unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected from subjects with clinically healthy gingival, chronic gingivitis and  chronic periodontitis with probing pocket depth >/=4mm and attachment loss >/=1mm. secretor status was determined by using haemagglutination inhibition assay. unstimulated whole saliva and sub gingival plaque samples were collected to culture and isolate the selected microorganisms. the clinical scores, secretor status and the presence or absence of selected microorganisms were compared within the groups using chi-square test and students unpaired t-test. results: the numbers of secretors were more in the healthy group (22.2%) and non secretors were more in the chronic periodontitis group (22.2%). the clinical scores were higher in the in non secretors compared to the secretors in all the three groups. p intermedia and p gingivalis were prevalent among non secretors in chronic gingivitis group. (p=0.075 and p=0.032) and chronic periodontitis group (p=0.068  and p=0.009).

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == comparative evaluation of bactericidal potential of four root canal filling materials against microflora of infected non-vital primary teeth.
AB  == background and objectives: since complete debridement of the root canals of the primary teeth is not practically possible due to the highly variable root canal anatomy, success of the endodontic therapy depends partly on the use ofantibacterial irrigating agents and root canal filling materials. recent literature indicates that anaerobes comprise a majority of the bacteria in necrotic root canals ofprimary teeth. the study determined the antibacterial effectiveness of four root canal filling materials namely calcium hydroxide, zinc oxide eugenol, vitapex and metapex against microbial specimens obtained directly  from necrotic root canals of primary teeth. method: microbial specimens were collected using sterile paper points, from 15 primary maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth of randomly selected children in the age group of 4-10 years with infected non vital primary teeth, requiring pulpectomy procedure. the microbial specimens collected were subjected to microbiological analysis and the antimicrobial potential of root canal filling materials were tested using agar diffusion technique. results: were statistically analyzed using one-way anova. facultative/aerobic organisms were isolated in all the cases, anaerobic organisms were isolated in 80% of the cases, and candida albicans was isolated in 1 case. zoe showed superior inhibitory activity against most of the organisms isolated followed by vitapex, calcium hydroxide and metapex in descending order. conclusion: our data may be useful as a guide for relative antimicrobial effectiveness or non-effectiveness of the materials employed. in vivo studies are required to state the specific antimicrobial activity and merits and demerits of  any of the test filling material.

TI  == specified species in gingival crevicular fluid predict bacterial diversity.
AB  == background: analysis of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) samples may give information of unattached (planktonic) subgingival bacteria. our study represents the first one targeting the identity of bacteria in gcf. methodology/principal findings: we determined bacterial species diversity in gcf samples of a group of  periodontitis patients and delineated contributing bacterial and host-associated  factors. subgingival paper point (pp) samples from the same sites were taken for  comparison. after dna extraction, 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified and dna-dna hybridization was performed using a microarray for over 300 bacterial species or  groups. altogether 133 species from 41 genera and 8 phyla were detected with 9 to 62 and 18 to 64 species in gcf and pp samples, respectively, per patient. projection to latent structures by means of partial least squares (pls) was applied to the multivariate data analysis. pls regression analysis showed that species of genera including campylobacter, selenomonas, porphyromonas, catonella, tannerella, dialister, peptostreptococcus, streptococcus and eubacterium had significant positive correlations and the number of teeth with low-grade attachment loss a significant negative correlation to species diversity in gcf samples. opls/o2pls discriminant analysis revealed significant positive correlations to gcf sample group membership for species of genera campylobacter,  leptotrichia, prevotella, dialister, tannerella, haemophilus, fusobacterium, eubacterium, and actinomyces. conclusions/significance: among a variety of detected species those traditionally classified as gram-negative anaerobes growing in mature subgingival biofilms were the main predictors for species diversity in gcf samples as well as responsible for distinguishing gcf samples from pp samples. gcf bacteria may provide new prospects for studying dynamic properties of subgingival biofilms.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide as an endodontic irrigant in a polymicrobial biofilm tooth model system.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == microbiology of acute complicated bacterial sinusitis at the university of the witwatersrand.
AB  == design: a retrospective chart review study at two referral hospitals identified 226 consecutive surgical patients with acute complicated sinusitis. subjects: one hundred and fifty-nine male and 67 female patients, with a mean age of 16.5 (standard deviation 0.7) years, underwent external fronto-ethmoidectomy with maxillary sinus washout and 13 had a concurrent craniotomy. results: a total of 233 micro-organisms were isolated from 163 patients(72.1%), and 63 (27.9%) were culture-negative. positive isolates included streptococcus milleri (18.5%), staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.6%), haemophilus influenzae (8.6%) and the anaerobes, peptostreptococcus (6.4%) and prevotella (4.7%) species. the prevalences of s. pneumoniae (2.6%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (1.3%) and moraxella catarrhalis (0.4%) were low. polymicrobial disease was present in 56 patients (34.4%). there was a significant difference between the two hospitals in the prevalences of some bacteria (p<0.05). antibiotic resistance was highest towards the penicillins (64.3%) and cephalosporins (12.5%). effective empiric treatment was achieved with metronidazole and a choice of amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin plus cloxacillin or penicillin plus chloramphenicol. conclusion: the polymicrobial nature and severity of complicated sinusitis warrants a de-escalation approach to antimicrobial therapy. the combination of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and metronidazole is a reasonable choice for initial empiric antibacterial therapy. selection of drugs for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with acute complicated sinusitis should be supported by knowledge of the local prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == a pediatric patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by eikenella corrodens.
AB  == a previously healthy 6-year-old boy had continuous fever for 6 days before admission to our hospital. his general condition was good except for pyrexia. the left lobe of the thyroid gland was swollen, red, hot, and tender, and neck movement was limited. the provisional diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. we demonstrated the existence of an orifice of the left piriform sinus by esophagography in this case, and made a diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by a piriform sinus fistula in the hypopharynx. the causative  organisms of acute suppurative thyroiditis include peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and alpha-streptococcus, but the organisms responsible are commonly undetectable in clinical cases. we detected eikenella corrodens in the present patient. although eikenella species occasionally causes  acute suppurative thyroiditis in adults, it is rare for this to happen in pediatric patients. antibiotics were administered for 7 days. we also performed aspiration of the abscess on the 8th day of the illness. the abscess was reduced  in size and tenderness was relieved after aspiration. in conclusion, if a pediatric patient has swelling, heat, tenderness, and redness of the anterior neck, we should keep in mind acute suppurative thyroiditis and the possibility of a fistula. if there is an abscess, we should immediately perform aspiration, culture, and isolation, and choose the appropriate antibiotics for the causative  bacteria.

TI  == the bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. however, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include:  anaerobic gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas); fusobacterium spp; and peptostreptococcus spp. in addition, streptococcus spp (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have been reported. aerobic and facultative  gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are haemophilus influenzae, treponema pallidum, bartonella henselae, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. the choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.

TI  == molecular analysis of persistent periradicular lesions and root ends reveals a diverse microbial profile.
AB  == introduction: the microbial etiology of periradicular lesions is recognized; however, the bacterial profile of these lesions is not well elucidated. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization in these lesions and to characterize the bacterial community present in root ends and periradicular lesions. methods: thirty-four adult patients who presented for  apicoectomy of persistent periradicular lesions after endodontic therapy were selected for the study and samples of periradicular tissue and resected root ends collected. total bacterial levels were estimated for 34 paired periradicular lesions and root ends using real-time polymerase chain reaction with universal bacterial primers. sixteen pairs of these samples were analyzed using ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing for bacterial identification. results: bacteria were detected more consistently and at higher levels in root ends. periradicular lesions exhibited a diverse microbial profile with many uncultivated phylotypes.  enterococcus faecalis and burkholderia cepacia predominated in both samples. campylobacter gracilis and streptococcus gordonii were associated with root ends, whereas atopobium rimae, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus genomospecies c8, dialister sp e2_20 e1, and eubacterium strain a35mt were associated with periradicular lesions. conclusions: persistent periradicular lesions are polymicrobial infections with many as-yet-uncultivated and unknown bacterial species. the bacterial load and microbial profile of root ends is significantly different from the soft-tissue lesion, indicating the presence of diverse bacterial populations in these tissues.

TI  == the effects of treatment of acute otitis media with a low dose vs a high dose of  amoxicillin on the nasopharyngeal flora.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects on the nasopharyngeal flora of therapy of acute otitis media in children with either a low dose or a high dose of amoxicillin. design: retrospective study. patients: of 50 children diagnosed as having acute otitis media, 25 received a low dose of amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d) (group 1) and 25 received a high dose of amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) (group 2) for 10 days, and both  groups were evaluated. intervention: antimicrobial treatment. results: before therapy, potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from the nasopharynx of 15 children in group 1 (60%) and 13 in group 2 (52%). the number of penicillin-susceptible isolates was equally reduced after both therapies. however, an increase was noted in the recovery of s aureus only in group 2 (from  2 to 6 organisms). a greater eradication rate of interfering organisms following  therapy was noted in group 2 (from 86 to 36) than in group 1 (from 92 to 60) (p < .001). these organisms include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and peptostreptococcus and prevotella species. conclusions: the oral flora at the end of therapy with a high dose of amoxicillin is more depleted of organisms with interfering capability than following treatment with a low dose of amoxicillin. these changes may contribute to the greater recovery rate of patients infected with s aureus who received a high dose of amoxicillin.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == [experimental vaginal dysbiosis on the model of white laboratory mice].
AB  == qualitative and quantitative composition of microbiocenosis of urogenital tract (ugt) of mice has been studied. when investigating ugt of mice in norm (n = 8), microorganisms of several genera with following occurrence frequency were detected: lactobacillus (100%), streptococcus (100%), staphylococcus (87.5%), micrococcus (12.5%), bacillus (12.5%), fusobacterium (87.5%), peptococcus (62.5%), peptostreptococcus (50%), bacteroides (100%) and representatives of enterobacteriaceae f (12.5%) family. a comparative analysis of ugt microflora in  norm and under physiologically proceeding pregnancy helped to detect in the group of pregnant animals the increase of occurrence frequency of such conventionally-pathogenous organisms as representatives of enterobacteriaceae family (6.86) and peptococcus genus (1.37 times), representatives of lactobacillus genus were found in 100% of animals. a possibility of ugt dysbiosis under microbialload made by the method of intravaginal introduction of 50 mkl of  staphilococcus aureus culture suspension which contains 1 x 109 cells/ml has been established. it was shown that clinical symptoms of dysbiosis (increase of ph, excretions at ugt outlet) correlate with disturbances in microbiocenosis of mice  ugt which are characterized by a decrease of occurrence frequency and titer of saprophyte microorganisms, first of all, lactobacillus (occurrence frequency decreased 15 times for anaerobic and 1.33 times for microaerophylic, and titers 1.32 times and 2.34 times, respectively), and by an increase of the titer of conventionally pathogenic bacteria, such as representatives of enterobacteriaceae family (14.5 times) and staphylococcus (6.17 times). investigation of the effect  of exogenic staphylococcal load on pregnancy has shown that the development of ugt dysbiosis affects the pregnancy result. thus, it was established that there were three cases of abortion and two cases of natimortality which were registered in the group of female mice (n = 5) which were administered staphylococcus after  they became pregnant. the paper is presented in russian.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == the ability of non-bacteriocin producing streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin hc5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5), but  s. bovis jb1 does not have antimicrobial activity. preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. when s. bovis jb1 cells were washed in stationary phase s. bovis hc5 cell-free culture supernatant, the s. bovis jb1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (clostridium sticklandii, clostridium aminophilum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). other non-bacteriocin producing s. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin hc5. bovicin hc5 that was bound to s. bovis jb1 was much more resistant to pronase e than cell-free bovicin hc5, but it could be  inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. acidic nacl treatment (100 mm, ph  2.0) liberates half of the bovicin hc5 from s. bovis hc5, but it did not prevent  bovicin hc5 from binding to s. bovis jb1. acidic nacl liberated some bovicin hc5  from s. bovis jb1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. bovicin hc5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind bovicin hc5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mm). acidic nacl-treated s. bovis jb1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able  to bind bovicin hc5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated s. bovis jb1  cells. based on these results, bovicin hc5 bound to s. bovis jb1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic foot ulcer biofilm infections determined using bacterial tag encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap).
AB  == background: diabetic extremity ulcers are associated with chronic infections. such ulcer infections are too often followed by amputation because there is little or no understanding of the ecology of such infections or how to control or eliminate this type of chronic infection. a primary impediment to the healing of  chronic wounds is biofilm phenotype infections. diabetic foot ulcers are the most common, disabling, and costly complications of diabetes. here we seek to derive a better understanding of the polymicrobial nature of chronic diabetic extremity ulcer infections. methods and findings: using a new bacterial tag encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) approach we have evaluated the bacterial diversity of 40 chronic diabetic foot ulcers from different patients. the most prevalent bacterial genus associated with diabetic chronic wounds was corynebacterium spp. findings also show that obligate anaerobes including bacteroides, peptoniphilus, fingoldia, anaerococcus, and peptostreptococcus spp.  are ubiquitous in diabetic ulcers, comprising a significant portion of the wound  biofilm communities. other major components of the bacterial communities included commonly cultured genera such as streptococcus, serratia, staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. conclusions: in this article, we highlight the patterns of population diversity observed in the samples and introduce preliminary evidence to support the concept of functional equivalent pathogroups (fep). here we introduce fep as consortia of genotypically distinct bacteria that symbiotically  produce a pathogenic community. according to this hypothesis, individual members  of these communities when they occur alone may not cause disease but when they coaggregate or consort together into a fep the synergistic effect provides the functional equivalence of well-known pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, giving the biofilm community the factors necessary to maintain chronic biofilm infections. further work is definitely warranted and needed in order to prove whether the feps concept is a viable hypothesis. the findings here also suggest that traditional culturing methods may be extremely biased as a diagnostic tool as they select for easily cultured organisms such as staphylococcus aureus and against difficult to culture bacteria such as anaerobes. while pcr methods also have bias, further work is now needed in comparing traditional culture results to high-resolution molecular diagnostic methods such as btefap.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == evolutional selection of a combinatorial phage library displaying randomly-rearranged various single domains of immunoglobulin (ig)-binding proteins (ibps) with four kinds of ig molecules.
AB  == background: protein a, protein g and protein l are three well-defined immunoglobulin (ig)-binding proteins (ibps), which show affinity for specific sites on ig of mammalian hosts. although the precise functions of these molecules are not fully understood, it is thought that they play an important role in pathogenicity of bacteria. the single domains of protein a, protein g and protein l were all demonstrated to have function to bind to ig. whether combinations of ig-binding domains of various ibps could exhibit useful novel binding is interesting. results: we used a combinatorial phage library which displayed randomly-rearranged various-peptide-linked molecules of d and a domains of protein a, designated pa(d) and pa(a) respectively, b2 domain of protein g (pg) and b3 domain of protein l (pl) for affinity selection with human igg (higg), human igm (higm), human iga (higa) and recombinant higg1-fc as bait respectively. two kinds of novel combinatorial molecules with characteristic structure of pa(a)-pg and pa(a)-pl were obtained in higg (higg1-fc) and higm (higa) post-selection populations respectively. in addition, the linking peptides among  all pa(a)-pg and pa(a)-pl structures was strongly selected, and showed interestingly divergent and convergent distribution. the phage binding assays and competitive inhibition experiments demonstrated that pa(a)-pg and pa(a)-pl combinations possess comparable binding advantages with higg/higg1-fc and higm/higa respectively. conclusion: in this work, a combinatorial phage library displaying ig-binding domains of protein a, protein g, or protein l joined by various random linking peptides was used to conducted evolutional selection in vitro with four kinds of ig molecules. two kinds of novel combinations of ig-binding domains, pa(a)-pg and pa(a)-pl, were obtained, and demonstrate the novel ig binding properties.

AB  == this present study investigated the changes in bacterial community composition, with an emphasis on lactobacillus spp. and streptococcus suis populations as potentially beneficial and harmful groups, in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning (21 days postpartum) by 16s rrna gene-based methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that, after weaning, predominant bands related to lactobacillus spp. disappeared and were replaced by  potential pathogenic species, such as peptostreptococcus anaerobius, moraxella cuniculi, s. suis and porphyromonas catoniae. real-time pcr revealed that the abundances of lactobacilli and lactobacillus sobrius as a proportion of total bacterial abundance were significantly lower in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets than in 21-day-old piglets. a specific and sensitive real-time pcr assay was developed for quantification of the important pathogen s. suis within gastrointestinal microbiota. the assay showed that s. suis predominated in the stomach samples of weaned piglets with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta, while it was not detected in the stomach before weaning. streptococcus suis was not dominant in the jejunum and ileum digesta before weaning, but became dominant after weaning, with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta.  the results demonstrated for the first time the postweaning dominance of the potentially harmful s. suis in piglet intestine. the results also suggest that the defensive barrier of the stomach can be impaired as s. suis became dominant while the proportion of lactobacillus populations decreased after weaning, which  may further result in an increase of s. suis abundance in the intestine.

TI  == campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses: a report of four cases and literature review.
AB  == campylobacter species are frequently isolated from fecal specimens of patients with diarrheal illness. several campylobacter species are commonly isolated from  the oral cavity. in contrast, campylobacter species are rarely isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses. reported here are four cases of extra-oro-intestinal abscesses due to polymicrobial flora, including campylobacter species. the first case is a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a brain abscess caused by c. gracilis, streptococcus constellatus, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. the second case is a 65-year-old man with a history of maxillary sinus carcinoma who developed a brain abscess due to polymicrobial flora, including c. concisus. the third case is a 24-year-old male  who was diagnosed with a vertebral abscess caused by c. rectus, eubacterium brachy, and actinomyces species. the fourth case is a 74-year-old woman who presented with an intraorbital abscess due to c. showae and micromonas (previously peptostreptococcus) micros. the first two patients died from a cause  directly related to their abscesses. all campylobacter species involved in the four cases were isolated anaerobically. the isolation of oral campylobacter species, e.g., c. rectus and c. showae, from abscesses suggests an oral source. a survey of the english literature was undertaken to identify reports of campylobacter species isolated from extra-oro-intestinal abscesses.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == infection associated with hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  == hematoma formation requiring operative treatment after shoulder arthroplasty may  be associated with higher patient morbidity. we therefore determined whether there was an association of hematoma formation requiring operative treatment with deep infection after shoulder arthroplasty. between 1978 and 2006, we performed 4147 shoulder arthroplasties in 3643 patients. of these, 12 shoulders (0.3%) underwent reoperation for hematoma formation. the mean time interval from arthroplasty to surgery for the hematoma was 7 days (range, 0.5-31 days). among nine cases in which cultures were taken, six had positive cultures; the organisms included propionibacterium acnes in three, staphylococcus epidermidis in one, streptococcus species in one, and staphylococcus epidermidis with peptostreptococcus in one. the minimum followup was 12 months (mean, 68 months; range, 12 to 294 months). two of the 12 patients eventually underwent resection arthroplasty for deep infection. the neer score was excellent in one, satisfactory in six, and unsatisfactory in five patients. the data suggest hematoma formation after shoulder arthroplasty is often accompanied by positive intraoperative cultures. the surgeon should be aware of the high rate of unsatisfactory results associated with this complication as well as the possibility of developing a deep infection requiring additional surgery. level of evidence: level iv, prognostic study. see guidelines for authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  == tongue biofilm areal density and tongue coating index.
AB  == two methods have been employed to measure the amount of tongue biofilm in humans: (1) areal density of microbes (cfu cm(-2)) (tongue scrape from a known/measured area), or (2) a tongue-coating index, where a human judge assesses the amount of  'coating' by visual inspection. the two methods were compared, both on human volunteers and on artificial biofilms. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), prevotella intermedia (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm) and peptostreptococcus micros (pm) were obtained from stock cultures. tongue scrape samples were obtained from four  human volunteers in order to inoculate the in vitro matrices. a further 16 individuals (total n = 20) were co-measured for both visible tongue coating and quantitative biofilm (cfu cm(-2)). tongue scrape suspensions were used to inoculate a cellulose matrix resting on a bhi-blood agar plate, periodically hydrated with sterile bhi and incubated for 10 days. visual coating density images were recorded by camera. the relative light absorbance of standard suspensions of cells (pure species) was obtained by spectrophotometry across the  visible spectrum. biomatrix yields (log cfu cm(-2) +/- sd) for fn, pi, sm and pm  were 7.07 (+/-0.04), 7.38 (+/-0.07), 7.25 (+/-0.10) and 7.41 (+/-0.011). higher yields were obtained for tongue-scrape mixed cultures, ranging from 7.47 to 7.76. biofilms (in vitro and in vivo) had different appearances when measured by human  judges in terms of colour, pigmentation and opacity. there was no correlation (r(2) < 0.02) between the two methods. biofilm matrices of similar population densities (ca approximately log 7.5) had widely different opacities depending on  the species present.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == detection and identification of bacterial dna in semen.
AB  == objective: to detect and identify bacteria in semen by sequencing polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified ribosomal rna gene regions (rdnas). design: bacterial rdnas were detected by pcr amplification of semen dna. conditions were  adjusted to detect only abundant organisms, no fewer than 20,000 bacteria/ml of semen. setting: clinical andrology laboratory and academic research laboratories. patient(s): men undergoing fertility evaluation (n = 29) or vasectomy (n = 5). intervention(s): none. main outcome meaure(s): frequency of bacterial rdna-positive specimens, relationship of rdnas to bacteria in genbank, and correlation with semen cells. result(s): twenty-five (56%) of the specimens from  22 (65%) of the men were positive. a total of 141 bacterial rdna sequences were compared with genbank data for identification. the largest group matched gram-positive anaerobic cocci (peptoniphilis, anaerococcus, finegoldia, peptostreptococcus spp.) in 13 specimens, followed by corynebacterium spp. in 10  specimens, staphylococcus, lactobacillus, and streptococcus spp. in 7 specimens each, pseudomonas spp. in 4 specimens, and haemophilus and acinetobacter spp. in  2 specimens each. the rdna-positive specimens averaged 59 +/- 13 million sperm/ml, 46 +/- 5% of which were motile, not statistically different from the rdna-negative specimens (77 +/- 16 million/ml, 47 +/- 5% motile). normal sperm forms were lower in the rdna-positive (10 +/- 1.1%) than in the rdna-negative specimens (22 +/- 2%), and lymphocytes/monocytes were fivefold lower in the rdna-positive specimens (0.4 +/- 0.2 million/ml) than in the negative specimens (1.9 +/- 0.7 million/ml). conclusion(s): abundant bacteria in semen are not commensal, arise from infection in the male genitourinary tract, may influence fertility, and may reflect an inadequate cellular immune response.

TI  == generation and expression of a minimal hybrid ig-receptor formed between single domains from proteins l and g.
AB  == the ig-binding properties of protein l from peptostreptococcus magnus and protein g from streptococcus have been successfully combined through the construction of  a novel hybrid protein, consisting of a single ig-binding domain from each protein. the biophysical and biochemical properties of this construct have been characterized through equilibrium and pre-equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy,  circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry, affinity chromatography, and conformational stability studies using a chemical denaturant in order to examine the structure and availability of ligand binding sites in each domain. these studies show that despite the small size of the protein (mw=16.5 kda) each  domain behaves in an independent manner with respect to the binding characteristics of the same domain in isolation.

TI  == cephalosporins in overcoming beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and preservation of the interfering bacteria in the treatment of otitis, sinusitis and tonsillitis.
AB  == the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (urtis) is complicated by the resurgence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) and the absence of interfering bacteria. blpb can have a direct pathogenic impact in causing the infection as well as an indirect impact through their ability to produce the enzyme beta-lactamase. blpb may not only survive penicillin therapy but can also  protect other penicillin-susceptible bacteria from penicillin. in this review, the clinical in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting the role of these organisms in the increased failure rate of penicillin in eradication of otitis, sinusitis and pharyngo-tonsillitis is outlined and the implication of that increased rate on the management of infections is discussed. bacteria with interference capability of potential respiratory pathogens can prevent colonization and subsequent invasion by these organisms. these include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci and prevotella and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment with antimicrobials can affect the balance between the interfering organisms and potential pathogens. the role of bacterial interference in urtis and its effect on their treatment is discussed. the use of some of the cephalosporins that are able to overcome the effect of blpb and preserve the beneficial interfering bacteria can overcome and modulate these phenomena and achieve better cure of urtis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subgingival and supragingival plaques of adult  patients with periodontal disease.
AB  == purpose: clinical, epidemiological and microbiological examinations of adult patients with periodontal disease. material and methods: the study of population  consisted of 21 subjects (13 female and 8 male) aged 38-58 years, treated in the  outpatient department of periodontology. dental examinations were performed at an artificial light and using a who periodontometer, a mirror and a probe. periodontal status was assessed by determination of the probing pocket depth (cpi), gingival state (gsbi according to muhlemann and son), and oral hygiene index (according to silness and loe). material for microbiological examination was collected from subgingival and supragingival plaques of each patient. additionally, pus was obtained from 8 patients and periodontal pocket fluid from  2 patients. the samples were examined for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and candida yeasts. standard procedures were used for culture and identification of bacteria and fungi. results: candida yeasts were not isolated from adults with periodontal disease. in 19/21 patients, cultures of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples were positive. a total of 42 bacterial strains were isolated from subgingival plaques, of which 24 (57.1%) belonged to 7 anaerobic species and 18 (42.9%) to 12 aerobic  species (p > 0.05). there were more aerobic (33/53; 62.3%) than anaerobic bacteria (20/53; 37.7%) (p < 0.05) in supragingival plaques. anaerobes were isolated more frequently than aerobes from the abscess (p < 0.05). conclusions: 1) in adult patients with periodontal disease, gram-positive anaerobes, including peptostreptococcus, were the predominant bacteria in the subgingival plaque. 2) while in the supragingival plaque, gram-positive aerobic cocci (streptococcus and staphylococcus) were predominant.

TI  == effect of smoking cessation on the microbial flora.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of smoking cessation on the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynges of smokers. design: nasopharyngeal cultures were taken from 20  smokers before and 12 to 15 months after cessation of smoking. potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. results: eleven potential pathogens (0.92 pathogens per subject) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained  from 9 individuals before smoking cessation, and 2 (0.17 per subject) were recovered from 2 individuals after smoking cessation (p < .05). bacterial interference between 2 aerobic (alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci) and 2 anaerobic species (prevotella and peptostreptococcus species) and 4 potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. bacterial interference was noted in 35 instances against the 4 potential pathogens by 14 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the smokers before cessation and in 116 instances by 42 isolates after cessation (p < .01). conclusion: to our knowledge, these findings illustrate for the first time that the high number of pathogens and low number of interfering organisms found in the nasopharynx of smokers revert to normal levels after complete cessation of smoking.

TI  == evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in italy for treatment of canine infections. of the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by peptostreptococcus + porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin  + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics  tested. the emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == root canal microbiota of dogs' teeth with periapical lesions induced by two different methods.
AB  == objective: the microbial composition was investigated in root canals of dogs' teeth with periapical lesions induced by 2 different methods: open versus sealed  canals. study design: teeth from group i (n = 16) were left open for a week, then sealed with composite resin for 120 days. the teeth from group ii (n = 16) were left open for the same period. microbiological samples from the root canals were  collected and processed by the anaerobic technique for identification and counting of microorganisms after establishment of periapical reactions. results:  seventy-four cultivable isolates were recovered in sealed canals (group i). strict anaerobes accounted for 64.9% of all species isolated, and gram-negative microorganisms accounted for 55.4%. microbial genera most frequently isolated were prevotella, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus,  clostridium, and porphyromonas. statistical analysis by pearson chi-square or fisher's test revealed positive association between sealed teeth and strict anaerobes (p < .05). in open canals (group ii), from a total of 58 cultivable isolates, 19% were strict anaerobes and 81% facultative anaerobes, with predominance of gram-positive species (75.8%). genera most frequently isolated were streptococcus, propionibacterium, staphylococcus, neisseria, and prevotella. conclusion: strict anaerobes were most frequently found in sealed teeth rather than in the teeth with canals left exposed to the oral cavity for 4 months. therefore, the method that induced periapical inflammatory lesions by intentional oral exposure, followed by tooth sealing, produced root canal microbiota similar  to the same found in humans.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a danish maternity ward?
AB  == objectives: to reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. materials and methods: twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. periodontal measurements included plaque index (pli), probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop). inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (cej) to the marginal bone crest (mbc) were measured on bitewing radiographs. in 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization. results: differences between the two examined groups were found related to "twin births" (p=0.0064) and "smokers" (p=0.03). none of the periodontal measurements showed any association. significant differences were found concerning presence of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. conclusion: a relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.

TI  == microbiology of intracranial abscesses and their associated sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the organisms recovered from infected sinuses and associated intracranial abscesses (ias). design: retrospective review of findings from aspirate of pus from 10 infected sinuses and their corresponding ias. setting: academic medical center. patients: ten patients diagnosed as having sinusitis (age range, 7-58 years). main outcome measure: aerobic and anaerobic bacteria findings from infected sinuses and ias. results: polymicrobial flora was found in 9 sinuses and 8 ias. anaerobes were isolated from all sinuses and 9 ias. a total of 26 isolates (2.6 isolates per specimen) were recovered from the sinuses: 19 anaerobic, 6 aerobic or facultative, and 1 microaerophilic; 17 isolates were found in the ias (1.7 isolates per site): 13 anaerobic, 2 aerobic or facultative, and 2 microaerophilic. the predominant anaerobes were fusobacterium species (in 5 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, 1 in a sinus only, and 1 in an ia only), prevotella species (in 3 corresponding sinuses and abscesses), peptostreptococcus species (in 2 corresponding sinuses and abscesses, and 4 in a sinus only), staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type b, microaerophilic streptococci, and bacteroides ureolyticus (in 1 corresponding sinus and abscess each). streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered 2 times, only from a sinus. alpha-hemolytic streptococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci group  f were each isolated once from the sinus. concordance in the microbiological findings between the sinus and the ia was found in all instances. however, certain organisms were present at only one or the other site. conclusion: these data illustrate the concordance in the recovery of organisms from infected sinuses and their associated ia and confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria  in sinusitis and ia.

TI  == [two cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == [bacterial spectra and antibiotics in odontogenic infections. renaissance of the  penicillins?].
AB  == background: the role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. an extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. material and methods: bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. results: a total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. the ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. the most frequent aerobes were members of the genera streptococcus (46 isolates), staphylococcus (10 isolates), and neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. the anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera eubacterium (19 isolates), peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and actinomyces (12 isolates). the most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were prevotella (46 isolates), and fusobacterium (21 isolates). the overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin g/v, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. the resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. penicillin g presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin g. the other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. penicillin g was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. the resistance rates were: penicillin g 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.

TI  == microbial analysis of the autogenous bone collected by bone filter during oral surgery: a clinical study.
AB  == purpose: the purposes of the study presented are to identify the microbial content of the collected bone debris and to determine the antibacterial efficiency of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing the microbial content of the  collected bone debris. patients and methods: twenty-five patients who had asymptomatic fully impacted mandibular third molars bilaterally underwent surgical removal for prophylactic and orthodontic considerations. immediately before surgery all patients rinsed with 10 ml of their assigned solution (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) for 2 minutes. before surgical removal of the teeth, bone debris was collected with a stringent aspiration protocol from the ramus by bone filter. the microbial content of the bone debris was assessed and the bacterial levels between the 2 groups were compared statistically. results: all samples from both groups (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) yielded viable microorganisms. there was no significant difference between the mean/median colony-forming units (cfu)/g values of both group samples, for aerobes (streptococcus salivarius) and anaerobes (bacteroides, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and veillonella species). with regard to total microorganisms, the mean cfu/g derived from the chlorhexidine group samples were  1.5 x 10(8) cfu/g per bone sample compared with 1.5 x 10(9) cfu/g for the sterile saline control group (p < .05). conclusion: although chlorhexidine rinsing immediately before surgery reduced the levels of total microorganisms when compared with stringent aspiration protocol alone, it has not been found effective on aerobic streptococcus salivarius and, importantly, on anaerobes. the reduced bacterial levels may still carry high infectious risk and may lead to failure in autogenous grafting procedures in oral surgery.

TI  == antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection {pad} used on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and in artificial and human root canals.
AB  == objectives: to measure antibacterial action of photoactivated disinfection (pad)  on endodontic bacteria in planktonic suspension and root canals. methods: four bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum,peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus intermedius, were tested in suspension. after mixing equal volumes of tolonium chloride and bacterial suspension for 60s, each 200 microl of concentration (>10(6)cfu ml(-1)) was irradiated with light at 633+/-2 nm. each energy dose/tolonium chloride concentration combination was tested eight times, with controls. prepared root canals in training blocs and extracted human  teeth were inoculated with s. intermedius followed by 10 mg l(-1) tolonium chloride or saline. bacteria in canals were sampled before and after light irradiation. student t-test assessed significance of changes in viable bacteria produced by treatment of either light or tolonium chloride alone and light/tolonium chloride combinations. results: in suspension, reductions in bacteria were highly significant (p<0.01) for light/tolonium chloride combinations compared to light or tolonium chloride alone. maximum mean log reductions of 1.14 (p. intermedia), 2.48 (p. micros), 2.81 (f. nucleatum) and 6.73 (s. intermedius) were at 4.8 j/20 mg l(-1). antibacterial action was increased by energy dose increase (not always significantly), but not by tolonium chloride concentration. in control canals mean log reductions of 0.42 (blocs) and 0.38 (teeth) from initial levels were not significant. pad mean log reductions of 2.40 (blocs) and 2.01 (teeth) were highly significant. changes for pad/energy dose combinations were not significant. conclusion: pad killed endodontic bacteria at statistically significant levels compared to controls. kills varied with bacterial species.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == identification of candidate periodontal pathogens and beneficial species by quantitative 16s clonal analysis.
AB  == most studies of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or targeted dna approaches, and so it is likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. the purpose of this study was to use culture-independent, quantitative analysis of biofilms associated with chronic periodontitis and periodontal health to identify pathogens and beneficial species. samples from subjects with periodontitis and controls were analyzed using ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing. several genera, many of them uncultivated, were associated with periodontitis, the most numerous of which were gram positive, including peptostreptococcus and filifactor. the genera megasphaera and desulfobulbus were elevated in periodontitis, and the levels of several species or phylotypes of campylobacter, selenomonas, deferribacteres, dialister, catonella, tannerella, streptococcus, atopobium, eubacterium, and treponema were  elevated in disease. streptococcus and veillonella spp. were found in high numbers in all samples and accounted for a significantly greater fraction of the  microbial community in healthy subjects than in those with periodontitis. the microbial profile of periodontal health also included the less-abundant genera campylobacter, abiotrophia, gemella, capnocytophaga, and neisseria. these newly identified candidates outnumbered porphyromonas gingivalis and other species previously implicated as periodontopathogens, and it is not clear if newly identified and more numerous species may play a more important role in pathogenesis. finally, more differences were found in the bacterial profile between subjects with periodontitis and healthy subjects than between deep and shallow sites within the same subject. this suggests that chronic periodontitis is the result of a global perturbation of the oral bacterial ecology rather than  a disease-site specific microbial shift.

TI  == genotypic characterization of bacteria cultured from duck faeces.
AB  == aims: to characterize the bacterial composition of mallard duck faeces and determine if novel bacterial species are present that could be utilized as potential indicators of avian faecal contamination. methods and results: combined samples of fresh faeces from four ducks were serially diluted and plated onto six different media selected to allow the growth of a range of organisms at 42 degrees c under three atmospheric conditions: aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic. forty-seven morphologically dissimilar isolates were purified and partial sequencing of the16s rrna indicated at least 31 bacterial species. twenty of these could be identified to the species level including pathogenic species of bacillus, campylobacter, clostridium and streptococcus. other species identified  included: enterococcus, escherichia, megamonas, cellulosimicrobium, neisseria, staphylococcus and veillonella. potentially novel species, which could represent  bacteria specific to avian fauna included bacillus, corynebacterium, macrococcus  and peptostreptococcus, while four isolates had <97% similarity to known bacterial species in the available databases. conclusion: a survey of the natural microflora of the mallard duck and its hybrid with the grey duck identified both  bacteria that are potentially human pathogenic and putative novel bacteria species as determined by 16s rrna sequencing. significance and impact of the study: this study provides further evidence that duck faeces is a potential human health hazard, and has identified bacteria potentially useful for distinguishing  duck faeces from other faecal sources.

TI  == tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian population.
AB  == objectives: to explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits.  material and methods: a total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. for each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythensis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponoma denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and streptococcus intermedius. two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). results: the prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. at score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. the depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. when the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. conclusions: no major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.

TI  == influence of denatured and intermediate states of folding on protein aggregation.
AB  == we simulate the aggregation thermodynamics and kinetics of proteins l and g, each of which self-assembles to the same alpha/beta [corrected] topology through distinct folding mechanisms. we find that the aggregation kinetics of both proteins at an experimentally relevant concentration exhibit both fast and slow aggregation pathways, although a greater proportion of protein g aggregation events are slow relative to those of found for protein l. these kinetic differences are correlated with the amount and distribution of intrachain contacts formed in the denatured state ensemble (dse), or an intermediate state ensemble (ise) if it exists, as well as the folding timescales of the two proteins. protein g aggregates more slowly than protein l due to its rapidly formed folding intermediate, which exhibits native intrachain contacts spread across the protein, suggesting that certain early folding intermediates may be selected for by evolution due to their protective role against unwanted aggregation. protein l shows only localized native structure in the dse with timescales of folding that are commensurate with the aggregation timescale, leaving it vulnerable to domain swapping or nonnative interactions with other chains that increase the aggregation rate. folding experiments that characterize  the structural signatures of the dse, ise, or the transition state ensemble (tse) under nonaggregating conditions should be able to predict regions where interchain contacts will be made in the aggregate, and to predict slower aggregation rates for proteins with contacts that are dispersed across the fold.  since proteins l and g can both form amyloid fibrils, this work also provides mechanistic and structural insight into the formation of prefibrillar species.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of antibiotic therapy in dentistry and  stomatology].
AB  == introduction: this study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) criteria. methods: a complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the mic90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. for  drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above mic (t > mic)  was calculated. for drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the auc/mic was calculated. results: amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. the spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory pk/pd indexes. conclusion: pk/pd indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. the pk/pd simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial treatment for helicobacter pylori infection on the intestinal microflora in japanese macaques.
AB  == eradication treatment for helicobacter pylori is known to cause mild but relatively frequent adverse effects. some adverse effects such as diarrhoea and soft stools are related to disruption of the composition of the intestinal microflora. this study investigated the microfloral changes resulting from administration of an eradication regimen using proton pump inhibitor (ppi), amoxycillin and clarithromycin. twenty-eight laboratory-bred japanese macaques either were administered eradication treatment by this regimen for 7 days or received no medication. faecal samples were collected for analysis on days 0, 8 and 15, and both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. among aerobic bacteria, streptococcus had significantly decreased by day 8, while enterococcus  and enterobacteriaceae had significantly increased. however, the total number of  aerobic bacteria was not significantly decreased from pretreatment levels 1 day after completion of treatment. the number of anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly by day 8. however, the number of lactobacillus and the detection rate of bifidobacterium, peptostreptococcus and veillonella significantly decreased by day 8, although the number of bifidobacterium, peptostreptococcus and veillonella had almost recovered up to the pretreatment levels 1 week after completion of treatment (day 15). these results suggest that the alterations in the composition of the intestinal microflora caused by the antimicrobial regimen  that excludes metronidazole are different from those caused by the regimen including this drug. however, the alterations in bacterial microflora had almost  reversed 7 days after completion of treatment in these macaques, which supports clinical findings that diarrhoea or soft stools in humans resolve relatively quickly after a similar treatment.

AB  == objective: pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (plbw)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. there is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence plbw infants. recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for plbw. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and plbw by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. methods:  clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum.  subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were  analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. in all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. statistical methods included student's t-test, fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). there were no statistically  significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental  and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than  in the cases (p<0.05). the occurrence rates of p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and s. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). according to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, p. micros and c. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of plbw (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). conclusion: the present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, p. micros and c. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for plbw, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of plbw. further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and plbw.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == socket infection due to retained gauze after evisceration.
AB  == a 64-year-old man had late-onset socket infection due to retained surgical gauze  after evisceration. external examination showed a mass of retained surgical gauze with copious yellowish discharge and gas bubbles. computed tomography scans showed a 3.2 x 2.4 x 2.4-cm heterogeneous mass and numerous gas bubbles. culture  of the discharge yielded pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus species, and fusobacterium species. surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy achieved a rapid resolution. retained gauze after evisceration may lead to socket infection, and such a complication should be avoided.

TI  == microbiological basis of oral infections and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. the special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. different anaerobic species belonging to the peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, gemella, and porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species streptococcus, staphylococcus, and corynebacterium. each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (actinomyces, prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these  conditions, as can yeasts (candida sp., histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (entamoeba gingivalis, trichomonas tenax). when infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). empirical treatment is  administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. however, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there  is a noticeable trend towards resistances. as a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. in recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. this in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections,  so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.

TI  == microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group a streptococcus ( streptococcus pyogenes ), staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae . anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while s. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. more than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. however, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

TI  == the role of sequence and structure in protein folding kinetics; the diffusion-collision model applied to proteins l and g.
AB  == the diffusion-collision model (dcm) is applied to the folding kinetics of protein l and protein g. in the dcm, the two proteins are treated as consisting of two beta-hairpins and one alpha-helix, so that they are isomorphous with the three-helix bundle dcm model. in the absence of sequence dependent factors, both  proteins would fold in the same way in the dcm, with the coalescence of the n-terminal hairpin and the helix slightly favored over the c-terminal hairpin and the helix because the former are closer together than the latter. however, sequence dependent factors make the n-terminal hairpin of protein l and the c-terminal hairpin of protein g more stable in the ensemble of unfolded conformations. this difference in the stabilities gives rise to the difference in the calculated folding behavior, in agreement with experiment.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. they often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. the original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group  peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. the treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology,  and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == whole-body autoradiography reveals that the peptostreptococcus magnus immunoglobulin-binding domains of protein l preferentially target b lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes in vivo.
AB  == protein l is an immunoglobulin (ig)-binding protein produced by the gram-positive bacterium peptostreptococcus magnus that interacts with the variable region of ig kappa light chains. the ig light chain-binding capacity of protein l gives it the potential to interact with cells expressing surface ig such as b cells. the present study was performed to address the in vivo trafficking of protein l at both the organ and the cellular level. using the powerful technique of whole-body autoradiography in a murine model system, we demonstrate specific targeting of protein l to secondary lymphoid tissues in whole-animal analysis. the observed targeting depends on the capacity to interact with murine ig, as tissue targeting was not apparent in mice given protein h, an ig-binding protein produced by streptococcus pyogenes with affinity for human but not murine ig. tissue targeting data were combined with flow cytometry analysis, which demonstrated the capacity of protein l to target and activate b lymphocytes in vivo. b cells targeted by protein l had increased surface expression of cd86 and mhc-ii, and protein l was present in vacuolar compartments of b cells. protein l did not bind t cells or natural killer cells but had some capacity to target dendritic cells and macrophages. the data show that protein l preferentially targets secondary lymphoid organs, and activates and is internalized by b cells in vivo. furthermore, the observed tissue and cell targeting properties require an affinity for murine ig. these data support the potential use of this ig-binding protein as a targeting approach to deliver agents to defined cell populations in  vivo.

TI  == the bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in kuwait.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. this study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (srp). methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: srp+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; srp alone and srp+tetracycline fibers (actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (ppd)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, plated on trypticase soy agar (tsa)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. the percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by dna probes and the checkerboard method. significance of differences among and within  groups over time was sought using the kruskal-wallis and friedman tests, respectively. results: the percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. the srp+actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. no significant changes were observed in the srp group. the predominant tetracycline-resistant species included streptococcus  spp., veillonela parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, gemella morbillorum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). a high percentage of sites with resistant aa, porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. however, t. forsythensis was not detected in any group and p. gingivalis was not present in the srp+actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. however, the greatest reduction was observed in the srp+actsite group. conclusion: local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == bacteremia following surgical dental extraction with an emphasis on anaerobic strains.
AB  == our aim was to investigate bacteremia caused by surgical extraction of partly erupted mandibular third molars. from 16 young adults, bacterial samples were taken from the third-molar pericoronal pocket and post-operatively from the extraction socket, and blood samples were drawn from the ante-cubital vein up to  30 min after surgery. of the subjects, 88% had detectable bacteremia-50% 1 min after the incision, 44% immediately after extraction. the respective percentages  at 10, 15, and 30 min were 44%, 25%, and 13%. blood cultures contained 31 species (74% anaerobes), with 3.9 +/- 2.6 species isolated per subject. most prevalent were the anaerobes prevotella, eubacterium, and peptostreptococcus sp. and the aerobes viridans-group streptococci and streptococcus milleri group. any species  found in the blood was also isolated from the mouth, from 93% of the pericoronal  pockets and from 43% of the extraction sockets. surgical dental extraction clearly causes bacteremia of a high frequency and lasting longer than thus far assumed.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == frozen cancellous bone allografts: positive cultures of implanted grafts in posterior fusions of the spine.
AB  == we have carried out a study on the behaviour pattern of implanted allografts initially stored in perfect conditions (aseptically processed, culture-negative and stored at -80 degrees c) but which presented positive cultures at the implantation stage. there is no information available on how to deal with this type of situation, so our aim was to set guidelines on the course of action which would be required in such a case. this was a retrospective study of 112 patients  who underwent a spinal arthrodesis and in whom a total of 189 allograft pieces were used. all previous bone and blood cultures and tests for hepatitis b and c,  syphilis and hiv (via pcr techniques) were negative. the allografts were stored by freezing them at -80 degrees c. a sample of the allograft was taken for culture in the operating theatre just before its implantation in all cases. the results of the cultures were obtained 3-5 days after the operation. there were 22 allografts with positive culture results (12%) after implantation. these allografts were implanted in 16 patients (14%). cultures were positive for staphylococci coagulase negative (ecn) in 10 grafts (46%), pseudomonas stutzeri in two grafts (9%), corynebacterium jeikeium in two grafts (9%), staphylococci coagulase positive in two grafts (9%) and for each of the following organisms in  one case each (4%): corynebacterium spp., actinomyces odontolyticus, streptococcus mitis, peptostreptococcus spp., rhodococcus equi and bacillus spp.  no clinical infection was seen in any of these patients. positive cultures could  be caused by non-detected contamination at harvesting, storing or during manipulation before implantation. the lack of clinical signs of infection during  the follow-up of our patients may indicate that no specific treatment different from our antibiotic protocol is required in the case of positive culture results  of a graft piece after implantation.

TI  == clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  == previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. we conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. most injuries were to the hands. fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. the median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. isolates included streptococcus anginosus (52%), staphylococcus aureus (30%), eikenella corrodens (30%), fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and prevotella melaninogenica (22%). candida species were found in 8%. fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, and candida species  were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. many strains of prevotella and s. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  == we studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. we recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. aerobes only were  recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group c beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), prevotella (22 [25.3%]), actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and veillonella (1 [1.1%]). beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). we found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.

TI  == microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate,  clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

TI  == planning of empirical antibiotic therapy for women with pelvic inflammatory diseases: a geographical area-specific study.
AB  == objective: elaboration of an empiric antibiotic regimen for women with pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) for a geographical area in eastern hungary. study design: pathogens were identified by culturing or polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from 2215 patients with suspected pid between 1 january 1999 and 31 december 2001. empiric guidelines for pid treatment were based on susceptibility testing of the recovered bacteria, patient acceptance and cost-effectiveness of drugs and recommendations of earlier studies. results: chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 11%, neisseria gonorrhoeae in 2%, streptococcus spp. in 17%, enterococcus spp. 9%, genital mycoplasmas in 25%, all obligate anaerobic pathogens in 30% of the patients. all antibiotics chosen for our regimen were effective in vitro against  one or more recovered pathogens at least in 80%; this regimen produced 98% clinical cure rate in mild cases of pid. conclusion: early detection and prompt empirical antimicrobial therapy adapted to the local microflora and its resistance pattern can lead to good clinical results.

TI  == importance of sequence specificity for predicting protein folding pathways: perturbed gaussian chain model.
AB  == recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that rates and pathways of protein folding are largely decided by topology of the native structures, at least for small proteins. however, some exceptions are known; for example, protein l and protein g have the same topology, but exhibit different characteristics of the tse. thus, folding pathways of some proteins are critically affected by detailed information on amino acid sequences. to investigate the sequence specificity, we calculate folding pathways of 20 small proteins using the perturbed gaussian chain model developed by portman et al. (phys rev lett 1998;81:5237-5240; j chem phys 2001;114:5069-5081). characteristics of the tse predicted by the model are in good agreement with experimental phi-value data for many proteins at coarse-grained level. especially, estimation of folding tse for protein g and protein l based on both topology and additional sequence information are consistent with experimental phi-value data. with only topology information, however, the model predicts the tse of protein g incorrectly. moreover, the model that uses topology and sequence information describes free energy profiles of two-state and three-state folders consistently with experiment, whereas the topology only model predicts free energy profiles of some proteins incorrectly. this indicates that sequence specificity also has critical roles in determining the folding pathways for some  proteins.

TI  == [the presence of bacteria and yeast like fungi in specimens from surgical patients].
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the incidence of candida spp. strains in specimens obtained from surgically treated patients as well as to analyze the accompanying bacterial flora, both aerobic and anaerobic. the material came from  two groups of patients. in the first group consisting of patients operated for colon and rectum carcinoma, the samples included peritoneal fluid, colon or rectum bioptates, pus, blood, and wound swabs. in the other group, biopsy material and smears from post operation wounds were taken from patients who underwent a surgical treatment of larynx carcinoma. altogether, 282 various clinical specimens from 165 patients were analysed, and 41 candida spp. strains were isolated: 39 strains of c. albicans and 2 strains of c. tropicalis. in 20 out of 41 specimens infected with candida spp. (48.8%) the co-infection with bacterial aerobic flora was found. in 10 cases (24.4%), the fungi were isolated together with aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora, whereas in 2 specimens (4.9%) the anaerobes and candida albicans were diagnosed. the remaining 9 samples showed only the presence of candida spp. (21.9%). from among aerobic bacterial flora enterococcus spp. strains (n = 17) and gram negative rods from enterobacteriaceae family (n = 13) were the most frequently isolated. the bacterial strains of streptococcus spp. (n = 5), pseudomonas spp. (n = 3), staphylococcus spp. and corynebacterium spp. (2 strains, both) were identified more rarely. bacteroides spp. were the most frequent members of bacterial anaerobic flora (n = 10). other isolated anaerobic bacteria were classified as fusobacterium spp. or peptostreptococcus spp. (1 strain each). e. coli and enterococcus spp. strains of aerobic bacterial flora were more frequently isolated together with candida spp. conclusions: (i) mixed bacterial flora was found to predominate in the clinical material from the patients after surgery. (ii) candida spp. were most frequently found together with aerobic bacterial flora.

TI  == fermentation of five sucrose isomers by human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == sucrose has five structural isomers: palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, maltulose and leucrose. although these isomers have been reported to be noncariogenic disaccharides, which cannot be utilized by mutans streptococci, there is no information about their fermentability by other bacteria in dental plaque. the purpose of the present study was to examine whether these isomers were fermented  by predominant bacteria in human dental plaque. clinical bacterial isolates obtained from dental plaque from 3 children aged 22 months to 50 months (146 strains) were inoculated into 3 ml of peptone-yeast extract (py medium) containing glucose for 1 day, then an aliquot of 20 microl of culture medium was  inoculated into 1 ml of py medium containing 1% (w/v) of the respective test carbohydrates. after incubation for 1 day, the ph values and the optical density  at 660 nm of the cultures were measured. fermentation ability was measured by ph  <or=5.5, growth by an od(660) of >or=0.5. of the clinical isolates, 33% fermented palatinose, and 69% of these were actinomyces species. all of the palatinose-fermenting bacterial strains fermented trehalulose, 25% fermented turanose, 70% fermented maltulose and 23% fermented leucrose. we therefore conclude that, in human dental plaque, there are significant numbers of bacteria  that are able to ferment sucrose isomers.

TI  == microbial dynamics of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  == this review presents the microbiological dynamic and therapeutic options in the management of purulent nasopharyngitis (npt). the nasopharynx (np) of healthy children is generally colonized by relatively non-pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic organisms, some of, which possess the ability to interfere with the growth of potential pathogens. conversely, carriage of potential respiratory aerobic pathogen such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, as well as some anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium and prevotella spp.) increases during purulent npt. the development of purulent npt in children is associated with the pre-existing colonization by potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms in the np. controversy exists regarding the management of npt as no conclusive evidence exists to date that the administration of antimicrobials will shorten the illness.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem (mk-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 enterobacteriaceae, 15 aeromonas spp., 42 staphylococcus spp., 43 streptococcus spp., 15 enterococcus spp., 30 haemophilus  spp., 15 moraxella catarrhalis, 12 neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 clostridium spp., 12 peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group bacteroides recovered from four spanish hospitals. ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae  (mic(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded ampc betalactamase-producing strains. ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (mic(90) > or =16 mg/l). ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) < or =1 mg/l). in the case of haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a mic(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. when considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against clostridium spp. (mic(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l). both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.

AB  == introduction: it has been suggested that between 3% and 13% of the cerebral abscesses (ca) are presumably associated to oral infections or dental procedures. aim: determine the prevalence of ca of oral origin, discussing their clinical and microbiological characteristics. patients and methods: retrospectively, 54 cases  of ca diagnosed in 3 hospitals of galicia between 2001 and 2002 were reviewed. results: a presumed oral portal of entry was recorded in 6 patients (11.1%); 4 cases were associated to oral infections and the remaining 2 had received dental  treatment in the months prior to the onset of symptoms. half of the patients showed irrelevant medical record, 2 had had previous extracranial abscesses and 1 presented a type a immunoglobulin deficiency. in 4 cases, the microbiological analysis was positive and typical oral bacteria (streptococcus viridans and peptostreptococcus spp.) were identified. conclusions: the results of this study  suggest that a significant number of ca are probably of oral origin. in consequence, to maintain a good oral health status is important and specific prophylactic measures before any dental procedure should be applied, especially in patients with risk recognized factors.

AB  == studies have shown significant bacterial leakage following exposure of sealed root canals to artificial and natural saliva. the objective of this study was to  determine contamination via bacterial migration in artificial saliva in endodontically treated teeth using different obturation techniques and sealers. a total of 144 extracted, human mandibular anterior teeth were cleaned and shaped to a #40 master apical file using hand and rotary instrumentation. one hundred and twenty teeth were divided into two experimental groups. the teeth in group 1  were obturated with gutta-percha using lateral compaction and five different sealers, and the teeth in group 2 were obturated with gutta-percha using thermomechanical compaction and five different sealers. the remaining 24 teeth were prepared as positive and negative controls. all specimens, except the negative controls, were inoculated every five days with anaerobic streptococci (nctc 9891) related to peptostreptococcus micros and prevotella intermedia (atcc  25611). the contamination onset time was continuously recorded and turbid broths  cultured for bacteria identification. the controls behaved as expected. regardless of the combination between obturation techniques and different sealers, all broths became turbid during this experiment. the correlation between the obturation techniques and the sealers revealed statistical significance using anova (p<0.0001), followed by the duncan multiple range test, which determined the ranking between these interactions. the combination of microseal obturation technique with ketac-endo sealer allowed a slower rate of coronal-apical bacterial migration.

AB  == previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (ome)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. a retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with ome was performed. the study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). a total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). there were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and staphylococcus spp. (seven). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. (eight each) and propionibacterium acnes (four). resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). the highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). of the patients treated with amoxycillin, h influenzae predominated. s pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. the data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with ome.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == deep neck infection: a present-day complication. a retrospective review of 83 cases (1998-2001).
AB  == deep neck infections are less and less frequent today than in the past. nevertheless, their complications are often life-threatening. the present study reviews the experience of the department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery of padua with deep neck infections during the period from 1998 to 2001. eighty-three patients (55 males and 28 females) were retrospectively considered.  the site of origin of deep neck infection was identified in 76 patients (91%). the most common cause was dental infection, occurring in 35 cases (42%). in 12 cases (14%) deep neck infection was a complication of oropharyngeal infection. the relatively high incidence of peptostreptococcus sp, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus intermedius and constellatus isolation was consistent with the high rate of odontogenic cases. surgery was advocated as the treatment for any infection of the deep neck spaces. the recent series has demonstrated that medical treatment did not seem to increase complication rates or mortality. our tailored approach (medical or medical and surgical) based on clinical and radiological evidence was successful in 97% of the patients.

TI  == immunoglobulin-binding domains: protein l from peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  == protein l is a multidomain cell-wall protein isolated from peptostreptococcus magnus. it belongs to a group of proteins that contain repeated domains that are  able to bind to igs without stimulating an immune response, the most characterized of this group being protein a ( staphylococcus aureus ) and protein g ( streptococcus ). both of these proteins bind predominantly to the interface of c(h)2-c(h)3 heavy chains, while protein l binds exclusively to the v(l) domain of the kappa -chain. the function of these proteins in vivo is not clear but it is thought that they enable the bacteria to evade the host's immune system. two binding sites for kappa -chain on a single ig-binding domain from protein l have  recently been reported and we give evidence that one site has a 25-55-fold higher affinity for kappa -chain than the second site.

TI  == differences in antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinse formulations: an in vitro contact test and salivary bacterial counts study.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of four commercial 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthrinses. material and methods: the in vitro antimicrobial activity test consisted in a modified contact test where 20 selected bacterial species were tested during 1 min with each test product. after the contact, the inoculum was cultured, and the results were expressed in terms of survival/resistance and the percentage of survival as compared to a saline control. the in vivo test consisted of a double-blind, randomized, crossover salivary bacterial counts study. 10 volunteers rinsed during 1 min with each tested product. saliva samples were obtained before rinsing, and after 5 min, and 1, 3, 5 and 7 h. these samples were cultured both aerobically and anaerobically.  percentages of survival, in regard to baseline, were calculated for each time point. comparisons among products were tested using anova and selected paired t-test. results: the in vitro contact test showed no survival in any tested species with chx+cpc, while three species (lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and peptostreptococcus micros) were resistant to the other three products.  chx and chx+naf demonstrated additional resistant species (three and four species, respectively). the in vivo salivary bacterial counts test showed higher  reductions of chx+cpc and chx+alc in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, lasting for  5 h. significant differences were detected at multiple time points, when these two products were compared both with the control and the other tested products. conclusion: important differences in activity, among 0.12% chx products, were detected by both in vitro and in vivo tests. the formulation with alcohol was more active than those without alcohol, excepting the formulation with chx+cpc, in which the reformulation and addition of cpc not only compensate but rather increase the antimicrobial activity.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  == gatifloxacin (bristol-myers squibb) and moxifloxacin (bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. in this investigation, we analyzed  the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. these samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic  = 0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml), and f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against h. influenzae (mic = 0.03 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus  (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and prevotella melaninogenica (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml). moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), h. influenzae (mic = 0.015 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.06 micro g/ml), f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml), prevotella melaninogenica (mic =0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml). the results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == identification of bacteria in acute endodontic infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the study was to identify the bacterial composition of  the microbiota from acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. study design: purulence from 17 patients with acute endodontic  abscesses/cellulitis was obtained by needle aspiration and processed under anaerobic conditions. bacteria were isolated and identified by biochemical or molecular methods. the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated bacteria was determined by using the etest. results: all 17 aspirates contained a mix of microorganisms. a total of 127 strains of bacteria were isolated. of 127 strains, 80 strains were anaerobes and 47 strains were aerobes. the mean number of strains per sample was 7.5 (range, 3 to 13). the average number of viable bacteria was 6.37 x 10(7) (range, 10(4) to 10(8)) colony-forming units/ml. strict anaerobes and microaerophiles were the dominant bacteria in 82% (14 of 17) of the cases. the genera of bacteria most frequently encountered were prevotella and streptococcus. prevotella and peptostreptococcus were frequently found to dominate the mixture. the combination of prevotella and streptococcus was found in 53% (9 of 17). the previously reported uncultured prevotella clone pus9.180 was frequently identified. the percentage of bacteria susceptible/intermediate for each antibiotic in this study was penicillin v, 81% (95 of 118); metronidazole, 88% (51 of 58); amoxicillin, 85% (100 of 118); amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, 100% (118 of 118); and clindamycin, 89% (105 of 118). conclusions: the present results confirm the existence of mixed infection with the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in acute endodontic abscesses/cellulitis.  the frequency of uncultured prevotella clone pus9.180 suggests the possible key role of this prevotella species in acute endodontic infections. penicillin v still possesses antimicrobial activity against the majority of bacteria isolated  from acute endodontic infections. however, if penicillin v therapy has failed to  be effective, the combination of penicillin v with metronidazole or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is recommended. switching to clindamycin is another good alternative.

TI  == prevalence of pathogens in diabetic foot infection in south indian type 2 diabetic patients.
AB  == aim: to determine the prevalence of pathogens in diabetic foot infections, in relation to parameters like wagner's grading, duration of diabetes and healing time. material and methods: a group of 654 (m:f, 433:221) type 2 diabetic patients with foot ulcers were studied. specimens like pus, wound exudate and tissue were processed for smear for gram's staining, aerobic and anaerobic culture, and biochemical identifications. results: in 654 diabetic patients, 728  pathogens were isolated. aerobic pathogens were isolated in 437 (66.8%) patients  and anaerobic pathogens were isolated in 217 (33.2%). as wagner's grading increased, the prevalence of anaerobic pathogens also increased. neuropathy was common in diabetic patients infected with both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. ulcers infected with anaerobic pathogens showed a longer healing time than ulcers infected with aerobic pathogens. there was no significant difference in peripheral vascular disease (pvd) in patients selected for the study. among aerobic pathogens, enterobacteriaceae family (48%), staphylococcus species (spp)  (18.2%), streptococcus spp (16.8%) and pseudomonas spp (17%) were seen frequently. among anaerobes peptostreptococcus spp and clostridium spp formed 69.4%. gram-negative anaerobes like bacteroides spp and fusobacterium spp were present in 30.6%. healing time was longer when strict aerobic pathogen pseudomonas spp and strict anaerobic pathogens were present (136.1 +/- 28.6 and 136.4 +/- 34.7 days, respectively). conclusions: diabetic foot infection is polymicrobial in nature. the healing time of wound infected with anaerobic pathogens was higher than those infected with aerobic pathogens. anaerobic pathogens increased with the wagner's grading. presence of neuropathy increased the risk of foot infection.

TI  == joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == the current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type-b, and group a streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, kingela kingae, neisseria meningiditis and salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. the predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are s. aureus, h. influenzae type-b, gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, s. pneumoniae, k. kingae, bartonella henselae and borrelia burgdorferi. anaerobes have rarely been  reported as a cause of these infections in children. the main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic gram negative bacilli including bacteroides fragilis  group, fusobacterium spp., clostridium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.

TI  == sequence variations within protein families are linearly related to structural variations.
AB  == it is commonly believed that similarities between the sequences of two proteins infer similarities between their structures. sequence alignments reliably recognize pairs of protein of similar structures provided that the percentage sequence identity between their two sequences is sufficiently high. this distinction, however, is statistically less reliable when the percentage sequence identity is lower than 30% and little is known then about the detailed relationship between the two measures of similarity. here, we investigate the inverse correlation between structural similarity and sequence similarity on 12 protein structure families. we define the structure similarity between two proteins as the crms distance between their structures. the sequence similarity for a pair of proteins is measured as the mean distance between the sequences in  the subsets of sequence space compatible with their structures. we obtain an approximation of the sequence space compatible with a protein by designing a collection of protein sequences both stable and specific to the structure of that protein. using these measures of sequence and structure similarities, we find that structural changes within a protein family are linearly related to changes in sequence similarity.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogens of orofacial odontogenic infections to 11 beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the current effectiveness of 11 beta-lactam antibiotics for treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections by determining the  antimicrobial susceptibility of the major pathogens. the antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans streptococci (n = 47), peptostreptococcus (n = 67),  porphyromonas (n = 18), fusobacterium (n = 57), black-pigmented prevotella (n = 59) and non-pigmented prevotella (n = 47) isolated from pus specimens of 93 orofacial odontogenic infections to penicillin g, cefmetazole, flomoxef, cefoperazone, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, cefoselis, imipenem and faropenem were determined using the agar dilution method. penicillin g, most cephalosporins, imipenem and faropenem worked well against viridans streptococci, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas and fusobacterium. penicillin g and most cephalosporins, including fourth-generation agents, were not effective against beta-lactamase-positive prevotella, though they were effective against beta-lactamase-negative strains. cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and faropenem expressed powerful antimicrobial activity against beta-lactamase-positive prevotella. in conclusion, penicillins have the potential to be first-line agents in the treatment of orofacial odontogenic infections. most of the other beta-lactam antibiotics, including fourth-generation cephalosporins, were not found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins. in contrast, cefmetazole, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and  faropenem were found to have greater effectiveness than penicillins.

TI  == randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of oral cefditoren 200 or 400 mg bid with either cefuroxime 250 mg bid or cefadroxil 500 mg bid for the treatment  of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == background: uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. because these infections typically are confined to  the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and  resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens. objective: this paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections. methods: two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each bid for 10 days. study 1 compared cefditoren with  cefuroxime; study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events. results: a total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. at the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in study 1 (p = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in study 2 (p = 0.018). eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for peptostreptococcus species in study 2 (p = 0.016 and p = 0.003, respectively). a  minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each p < 0.05). all 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to  moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache. conclusion:  in this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.

TI  == cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in newborns due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology and management of the major cutaneous and  subcutaneous infections in newborns where anaerobic bacteria predominate: omphalitis, necrotizing fasciitis, breast abscess, and scalp infection following  intrauterine fetal monitoring. the predominant bacteria known to cause these infections are group b streptococcus, group d enterococcus, group a streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic bacteria. all of these agents can colonize or infect the mother and subsequently colonize or infect the fetus or newborn either intrauterinely or during the passage through the birth canal. infections due to anaerobes are often polymicrobial, and include also aerobic and facultative bacteria. the anaerobes recovered from these infections are bacteroided fragilis group, fusobacterium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. early recognition and effective medical and surgical therapy are essential to recovery. managements of these infections include surgical debridement and drainage when appropriate as well as topical and systemic use of antimicrobial agents effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  == tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. it is endemic in many countries in latin america, the  caribbean and sub-saharan africa. although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. we conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in fortaleza,  capital of ceara state (northeast brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. the most common species were staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). bacillus sp., enteroccous faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we  detected peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. these results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. it is proposed that t. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. to prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.

TI  == invasion of dentinal tubules by oral bacteria.
AB  == bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules commonly occurs when dentin is exposed following a breach in the integrity of the overlying enamel or cementum. bacterial products diffuse through the dentinal tubule toward the pulp and evoke  inflammatory changes in the pulpo-dentin complex. these may eliminate the bacterial insult and block the route of infection. unchecked, invasion results in pulpitis and pulp necrosis, infection of the root canal system, and periapical disease. while several hundred bacterial species are known to inhabit the oral cavity, a relatively small and select group of bacteria is involved in the invasion of dentinal tubules and subsequent infection of the root canal space. gram-positive organisms dominate the tubule microflora in both carious and non-carious dentin. the relatively high numbers of obligate anaerobes present-such as eubacterium spp., propionibacterium spp., bifidobacterium spp., peptostreptococcus micros, and veillonella spp.-suggest that the environment favors growth of these bacteria. gram-negative obligate anaerobic rods, e.g., porphyromonas spp., are less frequently recovered. streptococci are among the most commonly identified bacteria that invade dentin. recent evidence suggests that streptococci may recognize components present within dentinal tubules, such  as collagen type i, which stimulate bacterial adhesion and intra-tubular growth.  specific interactions of other oral bacteria with invading streptococci may then  facilitate the invasion of dentin by select bacterial groupings. an understanding the mechanisms involved in dentinal tubule invasion by bacteria should allow for  the development of new control strategies, such as inhibitory compounds incorporated into oral health care products or dental materials, which would assist in the practice of endodontics.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == the effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. this study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (cbd). twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector (fbc) during the insertion of two dental implants. in group  t a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group c sterile water was used. for both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular actinomyces  odontolyticus, clostridium bifermentans, prevotella intermedia, and propionibacterium propionicum. samples from group t (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (p < 0.001) than in group c (sterile water  mouthrinse). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of cbd.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of indigenous indians of central america.
AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == differences in backbone dynamics of two homologous bacterial albumin-binding modules: implications for binding specificity and bacterial adaptation.
AB  == proteins g and pab are bacterial albumin-binding proteins expressed at the surface of group c and g streptococci and peptostreptococcus magnus, respectively. repeated albumin-binding domains, known as ga modules, are found in both proteins. the third ga module of protein g from the group g streptococcal strain g148 (g148-ga3) and the second ga module of protein pab from p.magnus strain alb8 (alb8-ga) exhibit 59% sequence identity and both fold to form three-helix bundle structures that are very stable against thermal denaturation.  alb8-ga binds human serum albumin with higher affinity than g148-ga3, but g148-ga3 shows substantially broader albumin-binding specificity than alb8-ga. the (15)n nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation measurements reported here,  show that the two ga modules exhibit mobility on the picosecond-nanosecond time scale in directly corresponding regions (loops and termini). most residues in g148-ga3 were seen to be involved in conformational exchange processes on the microsecond-millisecond time scale, whereas for alb8-ga such motions were only identified for the beginning of helix 2 and its preceding loop. furthermore, and  more importantly, hydrogen-deuterium exchange and saturation transfer experiments reveal large differences between the two ga modules with respect to motions on the second-hour time scale. the high degree of similarity between the two ga modules with respect to sequence, structure and stability, and the observed differences in dynamics, binding affinity and binding specificity to different albumins, suggest a distinct correlation between dynamics, binding affinity and binding specificity. finally, it is noteworthy in this context that the module g148-ga3, which has broad albumin-binding specificity, is expressed by group c and g streptococci known to infect all mammalian species, whereas p.magnus with the alb8-ga module has been isolated only from humans.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses.
AB  == despite the high incidence of odontogenic abscesses in pet rabbits, published data on the bacteriology of these infections are lacking, and clinical cultures are often ambiguous, making antibiotic choices difficult. in order to define the  bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. all specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella heparinolytica, prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus milleri group, actinomyces israelii, and arcanobacterium haemolyticum. these organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. the isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == periapical lesion progression with controlled microbial inoculation in a type i diabetic mouse model.
AB  == uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may be a risk factor for the  development of large and/or debilitating periapical infections. the objectives of this investigation were to: (i) determine the effect of diabetes mellitus on the  pathogenesis of periapical lesions with or without specific bacterial inoculations at the exposure sites, and (ii) test the sensitivities of two microbiological techniques in detecting the persistence of the bacterial inoculum in exposed pulps of nonobese diabetic (nod) mice. periapical lesions were induced in first molars of 29 female nod mice and 31 balb/c controls. acute (1-2 wk) or chronic (5 wk) exposures were either inoculated with a mixture of facultative and anaerobic bacteria or exposed to oral flora without inoculations. after death the teeth in the chronic groups were analyzed for the presence of the inoculated bacteria by culturing and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s rdna. periapical lesion size was measured histomorphometrically and the interleukin-6 content was measured immunohistochemically. the mortality among nod mice with inoculated and sealed exposures was 83%, compared with 29% for balb/c mice. in the inoculated and uninoculated chronic nod mice groups, 38% of the animals versus none of the balb/c mice died. the chronic uninoculated nod mice lost significantly more weight at the time of death than controls. polymerase chain reaction was more sensitive than culturing in detecting the inoculated anaerobic  bacteria. in the animals that survived to the predetermined time periods, lesion  size and interleukin-6 content in nod and balb/c mice were not statistically different.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == molecular identification of microorganisms from endodontic infections.
AB  == a relatively wide range of bacteria have been isolated from root canals using standard culture techniques. however, only 50% of the bacteria in the oral cavity are cultivable (s. s. socransky et al., arch. oral biol. 8:278-280, 1963); hence, bacterial diversity in endodontic infections is underestimated. this study used a pcr-based 16s rrna gene assay, followed by cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna amplicons from a small subset of samples to assess the diversity of bacteria present in infected root canals. a total of 41 clinical samples from 15 de novo and 26 refractory cases of endodontic infections were assessed. of these samples, 44% were positive by culture and 68% were positive by pcr. eight samples were selected for further analysis. of these, the two de novo cases yielded sequences  related to those of the genera enterococcus, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, and streptococcus and two clones were related to previously uncultivated bacteria, while the sinus-associated, de novo case yielded sequences related to those of the genera lactobacillus, pantoea, prevotella, and selenomonas. the five refractory cases produced clones which were related to the genera capnocytophaga, cytophaga, dialister, eubacterium, fusobacterium, gemella, mogibacterium, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, propionibacterium, selenomonas, solobacterium, streptococcus, and veillonella and two clones representing previously uncultivated bacteria. the phylogenetic positions of several clones associated with the clostridiaceae and sporomusa subgroups of the firmicutes grouping are also shown. this study demonstrates that molecular techniques can detect the presence of bacteria in endodontic infections when culture techniques yield a negative result and can be used to identify a wider range of endodontic-infection-related bacteria including the presence of previously unidentified or unculturable bacteria.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  == aim: the bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. methodology: single-species biofilms of prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum and enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as a control. the antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells  were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. results: iodine and naocl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against p. micros and p. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. iodine and naocl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. however, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. none of the agents were effective against f. nucleatum after 15 min but naocl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. colloidal silver was generally ineffective. conclusions: the effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. naocl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. however the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.

(19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == computer-based redesign of a protein folding pathway.
AB  == a fundamental test of our current understanding of protein folding is to rationally redesign protein folding pathways. we use a computer-based design strategy to switch the folding pathway of protein g, which normally involves formation of the second, but not the first, beta-turn at the rate limiting step in folding. backbone conformations and amino acid sequences that maximize the interaction density in the first beta-hairpin were identified, and two variants containing 11 amino acid replacements were found to be approximately 4 kcal mol-1 more stable than wild type protein g. kinetic studies show that the redesigned proteins fold approximately 100 x faster than wild type protein and that the first beta-turn is formed and the second disrupted at the rate limiting step in folding.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == [pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  == azithromycin (zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in japan in march 2000. it showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. its activity against h. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. after oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of s. aureus. in experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. these pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.

TI  == in vitro activity and post-antibiotic effect of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid).
AB  == the in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid), ampicillin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were examined and compared against 526 gram-positive bacteria. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, were low (mic(90) = 0.5 mg/l), and were comparable with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. this compound was superior to the macrolides and highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains), with mic(90) = 2 mg/l. it was also active against other streptococci, with mic(90) = 4 mg/l. however, this agent is less active against enterococci (mic(90) = 32 mg/l). quinupristin/dalfopristin showed high activity against gram-positive anaerobes, including clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., with mic(90) < or = 2 mg/l. quinupristin/dalfopristin was also investigated for its post-antibiotic effect (pae) and bactericidal kinetics against nine strains of gram-positive organisms, including staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. exponentially growing (log phase) cultures were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin at 2 x mic. growth kinetics was evaluated using viable  counting. the drug was uniformly bactericidal against pneumococci and staphylococci within 2 and 8 h of exposure, respectively. the killing activity against enterococci was weak; there was little or no reduction in bacterial count over 24 h of incubation. paes ranging from 2.13 to 3.28 h, 0.92 to 3.02 h and 1.89 to 7.07 h were produced on the tested pneumococci, staphylococci and enterococci, respectively. this study showed that quinupristin/dalfopristin is a  promising agent active against gram-positive bacteria. the prolonged paes also suggest that the drug could be used intermittently at more widely spaced dosing intervals against gram-positive organisms.

TI  == bacteria isolated after unsuccessful endodontic treatment in a north american population.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial flora present in teeth after the failure of root canal therapy in a north american population. these results were then compared with those of the previous scandinavian studies. study design: fifty-four root-filled teeth with persistent periapical radiolucencies were selected for retreatment. after removal of the root-filling material, the canals were sampled with paper points, and by reaming of the apical dentin. both samples were grown under aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions. then the bacterial growth was analyzed. results: the microbial flora was mainly of 1 to 2 strains of predominantly gram-positive organisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most commonly recovered bacterial species. conclusions: bacteria were cultivated in 34 of the 54 teeth examined in  the study. e faecalis was identified in 30% of the teeth with a positive culture.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

AB  == the unilateral mucosal samples were taken from 42 patients and were cultured for  bacteria. meanwhile, the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for 11 antibiotics and the beta-lactamase-producing bacteria(beta lpb) were examined. in 85.71% of all samples, bacterial growth was present. anaerobic bacteria were present in 21.43% of cases. predominant aerobic bacteria were alpha-hemolytic streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci. predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus species and bacteroides species. the beta lpb were isolated from 40% patients, which were responsible for the resistance to some antibiotics. the antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the antibiotics containing beta-lactamase inhibitor, third-generation cephalosporins and third-generation quinolones had good efficacy. our findings indicated the bacterial infection may not play the key role in the development of chronic sinusitis and the bacterial infection may not play the key role in the development of chronic sinusitis and the resistance to some antibiotics due to the high prevalence of beta-lactamase production must be considered when the antibiotics therapy is taken.

TI  == microorganisms isolated from root canals presenting necrotic pulp and their drug  susceptibility in vitro.
AB  == the knowledge about causative agents involved in endodontic infections is increasing, especially due to the improvement of culture techniques for anaerobic bacteria, showing that these microorganisms are predominant in this pathology. in this study, 31 canals with pulp necrosis were microbiologically analyzed before and after manipulation. obligate and facultative anaerobes, microaerophilic bacteria and yeasts were recovered from 24, 14, 5 and 2 clinical specimens, respectively. the most frequent genera were prevotella, fusobacterium, lactobacillus, streptococcus, clostridium and peptostreptococcus for bacteria and candida and saccharomyces for yeasts. strong positive associations, using an odds ratio system, were found between clostridium and prevotella and between peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium. even after the instrumentation and the use  of ca(oh)2, facultative anaerobes were detected in two root canals and yeasts in  three. microorganisms were isolated from seven canals at the end of the endodontic treatment: facultative anaerobes from five and yeasts from one. the microbiological evaluation of root canals with pulp necrosis suggests the presence of polymicrobial infections, mainly involving obligate anaerobes, and shows that the infection may persist after treatment.

TI  == interleukin-6 deficiency increases inflammatory bone destruction.
AB  == periapical bone destruction occurs as a consequence of pulpal infection. in previous studies, we showed that interleukin-1 (il-1) is the primary stimulator of bone destruction in this model. il-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is induced in these infections and has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. in the present study, we determined the role of il-6 in regulating il-1 expression and bone resorption. the first molars of il-6 knockouts (il-6(-/-)) and wild-type mice were subjected to surgical pulp exposure and infection with a mixture of four common pulpal pathogens, including prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. mice were killed after 21 days, and bone destruction and cytokine expression were determined. surprisingly, bone destruction was significantly increased in il-6(-/-) mice versus that in wild-type mice (by 30%; p < 0.001). in a second experiment, the effects of chronic (il-6(-/-)) il-6 deficiency and short-term il-6 deficiency induced by in vivo antibody neutralization were determined. both  il-6(-/-) (30%; p < 0.001) and anti-il-6 antibody-treated mice (40%; p < 0.05) exhibited increased periapical bone resorption, compared to wild-type controls. the increased bone resorption in il-6-deficient animals correlated with increases in osteoclast numbers, as well as with elevated expression of bone-resorptive cytokines il-1alpha and il-1beta, in periapical lesions and with decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10. these data demonstrate that endogenous il-6 expression has significant anti-inflammatory effects in modulating infection-stimulated bone destruction in vivo.

TI  == two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to staphylococcus aureus and rarely staphylococcus epidermidis, kingella kingae,  enterobacteriaciae, and streptococcus pneumoniae. in many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. patient 1. a 10-year-old male presented with  6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. the patient had a temperature of 104 degrees f. laboratory tests were within normal limits, except  for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr), which was 58 mm/hour. blood culture showed no growth. magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra  disk. there was no other abnormality. a computed tomography (ct)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic  and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and gram-positive cocci in chains. cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. the patient was treated with intravenous penicillin  600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every  6 hours for 3 weeks. the back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the esr returned  to normal at the end of therapy. follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. patient 2. an 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. he had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he  received no therapy. the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees f, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. laboratory tests were normal, except for  the esr (42 mm/hour). radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. a ct scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. ct-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform gram-negative bacilli.  anaerobic culture grew light growth of fusobacterium nucleatum. the organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. back pain resolved within 2 weeks. a 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. this report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. the lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. this is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. this was the case in our second patient, who was infected by f nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. the origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. the presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. the preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have  been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of f nucleatum. p magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. this report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1997  and march 1998].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during the period from april 1997 to march 1998. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. a total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rate  of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic gram-positive bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated  from primary infections, followed by p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. we found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of s.  aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of enterococcus spp. the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of b. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.

TI  == b-cell deficiency predisposes mice to disseminating anaerobic infections: protection by passive antibody transfer.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a high proportion of rag-2 scid knockout mice, which lack t and b cells, develop orofacial abscesses and disseminated infections following pulpal infection, whereas immunocompetent control mice do not. in the present study, we sought to identify the components of the adaptive immune response which contribute to protection against disseminating anaerobic infections and sepsis. for this purpose, various genetically engineered immunodeficient mice were employed, including rag-2 scid, igh-6 (b-cell deficient), tcrb tcrd (t-cell deficient) and hc(0) (c5 deficient). for abscess induction, the mandibular first molars were subjected to pulp exposure on day 0.  teeth were infected with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, including prevotella intermedia, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros, and teeth were sealed to prevent communication with the oral cavity. the findings demonstrate that both rag-2 scid and b-cell-deficient mice, but not t-cell- or c5-deficient mice, have increased susceptibility to the development of disseminating anaerobic infections. abscess-susceptible rag-2 scid and b-cell-deficient mice also showed a significant loss of body weight, splenomegaly, and absent antibacterial antibody  production. furthermore, dissemination was significantly reduced, from 74 to 25%, in susceptible rag-2 mice by passively transferred antibody, predominantly immunoglobulin g2b (igg2b) and igm, against the infecting bacterial innoculum. fractionated igg-enriched preparations were more efficient in transferring protection than igm preparations. we conclude that an antibody-mediated mechanism(s), most likely bacterial opsonization, is of importance in localizing  anaerobic root canal infections and in preventing their systemic spread.

TI  == bacterial immunoglobulin superantigen proteins a and l activate human heart mast  cells by interacting with immunoglobulin e.
AB  == human heart mast cells (hhmc) have been identified in heart tissue, perivascularly, and in the intima of coronary arteries. in vitro activation of isolated hhmc induces the release of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators (histamine, tryptase, and cysteinyl leukotriene c(4) [ltc(4)]). we investigated the effects of several bacterial proteins on hhmc activation in vitro. hhmc released histamine, tryptase, and ltc(4) in response to staphylococcus aureus cowan 1 and the immunoglobulin (ig)-binding protein a, but not to s. aureus wood  46, which does not synthesize protein a. the effect of protein a was inhibited by preincubation with monoclonal igm v(h)3(+). some strains of peptostreptococcus magnus express an ig light chain-binding surface protein called protein l. such bacteria and soluble protein l stimulated the release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators from hhmc. preincubation of hhmc with either protein a or protein l resulted in complete cross-desensitization to a subsequent challenge with the heterologous stimulus or anti-ige. monoclonal ige (kappa chains) blocked protein l-induced release, whereas ige (lambda chains) had no effect. streptococcal protein g, formyl-containing tripeptide, and pepstatin a did not activate hhmc. bacterial products protein a and protein l and intact bacteria (s. aureus and p. magnus) activate hhmc by acting as ig superantigens.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == critical role of beta-hairpin formation in protein g folding.
AB  == comparison of the folding mechanisms of proteins with similar structures but very different sequences can provide fundamental insights into the determinants of protein folding mechanisms. despite very little sequence similarity, the approximately 60 residue igg binding domains of protein g and protein l both consist of a single helix packed against a four-stranded sheet formed by two symmetrically disposed beta-hairpins. we demonstrate that, as in the case of protein l, one of the two beta-turns of protein g is formed and the other disrupted in the folding transition state. unlike protein l, however, in protein  g it is the second beta-turn that is formed in the folding transition state ensemble. substitution of an asp residue by ala in protein g that eliminates an i,i+2 side chain-main chain hydrogen bond in the second beta-turn slows the folding rate approximately 20-fold but has virtually no effect on the unfolding rate. taken together with previous results, these findings suggest that the presence of an intact beta-turn in the folding transition state is a consequence  of the overall topology of protein l and protein g, but the particular hairpin that is formed is determined by the detailed interatomic interactions that determine the free energies of formation of the isolated beta-hairpins.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice have reduced bone destruction following mixed anaerobic infection.
AB  == c3h/hej mice have an impaired ability to respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) due  to a mutation in the gene that encodes toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4). the effect of tlr4 deficiency on host responses to endodontic infections is unknown. in the present study, we compared periapical bone destruction, sepsis, and inflammatory  cytokine production in lps-hyporesponsive c3h/hej and wild-type control c3h/heouj mice. the mandibular first molars of both strains were subjected to pulpal exposure and infection with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. at sacrifice on day 21, tlr4-deficient c3h/hej mice had significantly reduced periapical bone destruction compared to wild-type c3h/heouj mice (p < 0.001). the decreased bone destruction in c3h/hej correlated  with reduced expression of the bone resorptive cytokines interleukin 1alpha (il-1alpha) (p < 0.01) and il-1beta (p < 0.05) as well as the proinflammatory cytokine il-12 (p < 0.05). no significant differences were seen in the levels of  gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), or il-10 between the two strains. the expression of il-1alpha, il-1beta, tnf-alpha, il-10, and il-12 were all significantly reduced in vitro in macrophages from both tlr4-deficient c3h/hej and c57bl/10scncr strains, compared to wild-type controls. notably, the responses of tlr4-deficient macrophages to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were similarly reduced. neither c3h/hej nor c3h/heouj mice exhibited orofacial abscess development or infection dissemination as determined by splenomegaly or cachexia. we conclude that intact tlr function mediates increased proinflammatory responses and bone destruction in response to mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == [results of treatment of deep neck abscesses and phlegmons].
AB  == introduction: neck, as a structure very closely connected with oral cavity and pharynx, with great number of lymph nodes, (about 2, 3 of all are in the neck), is sometimes a localization of purulent inflammatory process but its incidence is not so high as the incidence of inflammations of surrounding organs and tissue. deep neck abscesses are localized under the upper fascial layer. they have a serious clinical picture which could be further complicated if inflammation spreads on vessels or neck organs. if the processes spread toward the mediastinum because of the communication space between medial and deep fascial layer with mediastinum, it could be mediastinal inflammation with high mortality. the aim of this study is evaluation of results of treatment in patients with deep neck abscesses and phlegmons treated at clinic in a ten year period (1988-1997). material and methods: this study comprised 21 patients who were treated at the ent clinic in novi sad during 1988-1997. the group consisted of 5 female and 16 male patients from one to 65 years of age. sixteen (76.2%) patients were treated  with antibiotics in general practice, and 5 were admitted without previous therapy, 8 patients were afebrile, with temperatures between 37-38 degrees c and  5 with fever and high temperature. in 17 patients 5 days passed from onset of symptoms to admittance at the clinic, and 4 patients had enlarged neck lymph nodes a few months. unknown primary site of infections were in 13 (61.9%) patients, that means abscesses developed as colliquation of inflammatory changed  lymph node. in the rest of 8 patients abscesses developed as: oropharyngeal inflammation (4 patients), foreign body perforation of esophagus, chronic otitis  media, neck injury, malignant lymphoma. lateral side of the neck was the most frequent site of neck abscesses and phlegmon in 16 (76%) patients. red skin over  the abscesses didn't appear in 4 patients. in 2 patients neck emphysema developed: anaerobic inflammation in one patient and esophageal perforation in the second. in a patient with se over the 50 per hour the length of the abscess was over 7 cm, and in those with se over 100 per hour, the whole neck inflammed.  all patients underwent surgical therapy between 24 to 48 h after admission with incision or excision of the abscesses. pus was collected for culture during the incision or excision of the abscesses and phlegmon. bacteria were discovered in specimens taken during the incision in 4 (19%) of patients. different aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated: enterococcus, peptostreptococcus sp, streptococcus viridans, clostridium species. surgery was the basic therapy of neck phlegmons and abscesses. in all patients incision was sutured in the second  stage. only one patient got paralysis of n. accesorius. one patient died with gas gangrene of the neck. discussion and conclusion: deep neck abscesses and phlegmons are relatively rare inflammations in spite of high incidence of surrounding tissue inflammations. the most frequent causes are inflammatory changes of lymph nodes. treatment has to be urgent, because of vital neck structures and communications between deep neck space and mediastinum. we consider that surgery is the basic principle of therapy although we have not had  experience with needle aspiration. antimicrobial agents must be given only parenterally.

TI  == minimal debridement in the treatment of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == scrotal and perineal gangrene of the male genitalia was first described by fournier in 1883. treatment of the disease remains surgical despite the availability of modern antibiotics. many authors advocate a wide debridement of all tissue superficial to the involved fascial layers. we have reviewed our experience of using wide and minimal debridement as the surgical technique of choice. in our retrospective study, nine patients were diagnosed and treated over a 2-year period for fournier's gangrene. the mean age was 65+/-28 years. two patients were admitted from chronic care facilities, four were diabetic, and two  had taken oral steroids. five of the nine patients were treated with the technique of minimal tissue debridement. in brief, the scrotum was bivalved along the median raphe, each scrotal sac was drained, and the testicles were exteriorized. orchiectomy was performed if the testicles were grossly necrotic. penrose drains were inserted from each scrotal sac to the counterincision at the  level of the internal rings. all of the tissue involved was irrigated with betadine and peroxide, after debridement of the necrotic tissue. broad-spectrum antibiotics along with daily packing were continued for 4 to 6 weeks; at the end  of that time the testicles were returned to the scrotum and the skin was loosely  reapproximated. three of the nine patients were treated with wide debridement of  all the soft tissue including the fascia. one of the patients displayed gangrene  of the entire abdominal wall; he was not a surgical candidate and died 3 days later. the four patients treated with minimal debridement all obtained successful treatment of their fasciitis. however, one died of complications related to a duodenal ulcer. the mean hospital stay was 45+/-10 days. two of the three patients treated with wide debridement required plastic reconstruction using a skin-muscle flap of the perineum. the remaining patient treated with wide debridement died of complications related to metastatic renal carcinoma. the mean hospital stay of this group was 62+/-12 days. the specific flora included: bacteroidis fragilis in 87 per cent, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus in 75 per cent, clostridia group, escherichia coli, enterobacter and pseudomonas in 62  per cent, klebsiella in 50 per cent, staphylococcus in 37 per cent, and proteus in 12 per cent of the patients. in the surgical management of fournier's gangrene, wide drainage with minimal debridement resulted in similar morbidity and shorter hospital stay when compared with extensive debridement.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == infection-stimulated infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction is increased in p-/e-selectin knockout mice.
AB  == infections of the dental pulp commonly result in infraosseus inflammation and bone destruction. however, the role of phagocytic leucocytes in the pathogenesis  of pulpal infections has been uncertain. in this work we used p/e-/- selectin-deficient mice, which lack rolling adhesion of leucocytes to endothelium and mimic the human syndrome, leucocyte adhesion deficiency ii (lad-ii), to test  the hypothesis that phagocytic leucocytes protect against pulpal infection and subsequent periapical infraosseus bone resorption. p/e-/- mice and p/e+/+ wild-type controls were subjected to surgical pulp exposure, and both groups were infected with a mixture of pulpal pathogens including prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius. animals were killed after 20 days, and the extent of infraosseus bone destruction was quantified by histomorphometry. in two separate experiments, p/e-/- mice had  significantly greater bone resorption than p/e+/+ controls. the increased bone destruction correlated with a twofold decrease in polymorphonuclear (pmn) infiltration into periapical inflammatory tissues of p/e-/- mice. p/e-/- mice had higher tissue levels of the bone resorptive cytokine, interleukin (il)-1alpha. tissue levels of il-2, il-4, il-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and  interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) were all higher in p/e-/- mice, but the increases were not statistically significant. only il-12 was higher in p/e+/+ mice, possibly reflecting a greater number of infiltrating monocytes in wild-type mice. these findings demonstrate that phagocytic leucocytes are protective in this model, and suggest that elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the observed bone destruction.

TI  == cervical necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience at a single institution.
AB  == objective: to evaluate clinical and microbiologic characteristics, modalities of  treatment and outcome of patients with cervical necrotizing fasciitis admitted to our institution. design: retrospective clinical investigation. patients and methods: we reviewed the charts of 20 consecutive patients hospitalized in our intensive care unit between january 1987 and june 1998 with the diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis. results: all the patients required mechanical ventilation. four of them had mediastinal involvement. the organisms most commonly implicated included streptococcus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species. patients with adequate surgery had a better outcome than those with inadequate surgical procedures. because no evidence-based recommendations exist in the field of head and neck infections, hyperbaric oxygen was not used as adjunctive therapy. of the 20 patients, 3 (15 %) died. conclusion: the main finding of this study is that prompt, rather than delayed, surgical debridement correlates with a decrease in morbidity and mortality. however, no definite conclusion is justified due to the relatively small number of patients. immediate radical debridement, and early redebridement if needed, appropriate antibiotics and intensive care support are critical in controlling these life-threatening infections.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == differential induction of colitis and gastritis in hla-b27 transgenic rats selectively colonized with bacteroides vulgatus or escherichia coli.
AB  == resident bacteria play an important role in initiating and perpetuating gastrointestinal inflammation. we previously demonstrated that six commensal bacteria including bacteroides vulgatus caused more aggressive colitis and gastritis in hla-b27 transgenic rats than did the other five bacteria without b.  vulgatus. this study compared the degree of gastrointestinal inflammation in gnotobiotic hla-b27 transgenic rats monoassociated with either b. vulgatus or escherichia coli. gnotobiotic transgenic rats raised in trexler isolators were selectively colonized with either b. vulgatus or e. coli. control rats were either germfree or colonized with six common commensal bacteria (streptococcus faecium, e. coli, streptococcus avium, eubacterium contortum, peptostreptococcus  productus, and b. vulgatus [desep-b]). after 1 month, all the rats were killed and tissues were prepared for histologic and biochemical evaluation. colitis induced by b. vulgatus monoassociation was almost equal to that in desep-b-colonized rats and was significantly more severe than e. coli-induced colitis, which was absent by histological testing and mild by colonic myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1beta concentration determinations. however, gastritis was detectable only in desep-b-associated rats. these studies suggest that not all resident bacteria have equal proinflammatory capabilities, since b.  vulgatus alone is more active than e. coli alone in inducing colitis, and that colitis and gastritis result from different luminal bacterial stimuli.

TI  == prevalence of corynebacterial 16s rrna sequences in patients with bacterial and "nonbacterial" prostatitis.
AB  == the etiology of chronic prostatitis syndromes in men is controversial, particularly when positive cultures for established uropathogens are lacking. although identification of bacteria in prostatic fluid has relied on cultivation  and microscopy, most microorganisms in the environment, including some human pathogens, are resistant to cultivation. we report here on an rrna-based molecular phylogenetic approach to the identification of bacteria in prostate fluid from prostatitis patients. positive bacterial signals were seen for 65% of  patients with chronic prostatitis overall. seven of 11 patients with bacterial signals but none of 6 patients without bacterial signals were cured with antibiotic-based therapy. results indicate the occurrence in the prostate fluid of a wide spectrum of bacterial species representing several genera. most rrna genes were closely related to those of species belonging to the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus, streptococcus, and escherichia. unexpectedly, a wide diversity of corynebacterium species was found  in high proportion compared to the proportions of other bacterial species found.  a subset of these 16s rrna sequences represent those of undescribed species on the basis of their positions in phylogenetic trees. these uncharacterized organisms were not detected in control samples, suggesting that the organisms have a role in the disease or are the consequence of the disease. these studies show that microorganisms associated with prostatitis generally occur as complex microbial communities that differ between patients. the results also indicate that microbial communities distinct from those associated with prostatitis may occur at low levels in normal prostatic fluid.

AB  == objective: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (sibos) is characterized by an abnormally high bacterial population level in the upper gut,  exceeding 10(5) organisms/ml (5 log colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml). to understand  its origin and select an appropriate antibiotic treatment, we have analyzed the bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in sibos patients. methods: jejunal samples of 63 consecutive patients with diarrhea or malabsorption and conditions predisposing to sibos were cultured and antibiotic sensitivities determined. results: concentrations of total, microaerophilic, and anaerobic bacteria were confirmed in 55 patients with sibos (mean +/- se) 7.6 +/- 0.8, 7.4  +/- 0.9, and 6.1 +/- 0.7 log cfu/ml, respectively. mean number of bacterial genera was 4.6 +/- 0.8. the main bacteria recovered were (mean +/- se log cfu/ml) streptococcus (71%; 6.4 +/- 0.8), escherichia coli (69%; 7.2 +/- 0.9), staphylococcus (25%; 6.2 +/- 0.6), micrococcus (22%; 6.0 +/- 0.7), klebsiella (20%; 7.1 +/- 0.8), proteus (11%; 6.1 +/- 0.8) for microaerophilic bacteria, and  lactobacillus (75%; 6.1 +/- 1.1), bacteroides (29%; 6.9 +/- 1.3), clostridium (25%; 5.5 +/- 1.0), veillonella (25%; 5.3 +/- 0.7), fusobacterium (13%; 4.8 +/- 0.5), and peptostreptococcus (13%; 6.1 +/- 0.7) for anaerobic bacteria. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefoxitin were efficient on >90% of strains. conclusions: contaminating flora isolated in sibos include commonly identified oropharyngeal and colonic flora, but these occur in sibos at different levels from those usually found in their original location. these data may hopefully serve as a starting point to further therapeutic controlled studies.

TI  == in vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == t-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. pazufloxacin (t-3761) is an active form of t-3762. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for prevotella bivia. the mics of t-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for s. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for g. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for e. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for p. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for b. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for p. bivia. the results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, t-3762, in combination with an agent  with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial properties of pexiganan, an analog of magainin.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the african clawed frog. pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the pexiganan mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, corynebacterium spp., pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium spp. comparison  of the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, mbcs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the mics, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. no  evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the mic50s and the mic90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. in conclusion, pexiganan exhibits  properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == infections associated with dental procedures in total hip arthroplasty.
AB  == dental procedures may lead to a transient bacteraemia lasting for up to 30 minutes. of the numerous cases of total hip arthroplasty (tha) reported which have been infected from haematogenous sources, dental procedures have been involved only infrequently. we reviewed the records of 2973 patients after tha. of the late infections identified in 52 patients, three (6%) were strongly associated with a dental procedure. infection was diagnosed by culture from the affected joint; streptococcus viridans was identified in two cases and peptostreptococcus in one. one patient had diabetes mellitus and another rheumatoid arthritis, both conditions predisposing to infection. the dental operations all lasted for more than 45 minutes and no patient received perioperative antibiotics. infection of a tha after dental procedures is more common than has been previously suspected. patients with systemic disease, or who are undergoing extensive procedures, should be considered for prophylactic antibiotic treatment.

TI  == microorganisms in closed periapical lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the microorganisms of strictly selected closed periapical lesions associated with both refractory endodontic therapy and pulpal calcification. definitive criteria were established that assured complete clinical isolation of the periapical lesion from the oral and periodontal environment. a total of 13 criteria-referenced lesions were selected  from 70 patients with endodontic surgical indications. a well controlled culturing method was used in all cases and samples were taken by one clinician at three separate sites during each surgery. samples taken at the surgical window and within the body of the lesion served as controls, whilst a third sample was taken at the apex. in all 13 cases, samples taken from the apex yielded microorganisms comprising 63.6% obligate anaerobes and 36.4% facultative anaerobes. prevalence of the isolated species was 31.8% for actinomyces sp., 22.7% propionibacterium sp., 18.2% streptococcus sp., 13.6% staphlyococcus sp., 4.6% porphyromonas gingivalis, 4.6% peptostreptococcus micros and 4.6% gram-negative enterics. the results of this investigation indicate that closed periapical lesions associated with calcified teeth or those resistant to root canal treatment harbour bacteria. the inability to eradicate all root canal microorganisms during root canal treatment, along with anatomical factors, may allow further bacterial colonization of the root apex and surrounding periapical  tissues, and consequently prevent healing.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

AB  == pus samples from twenty-three dentoalveolar abscesses were collected by needle aspiration and examined by direct inoculation technique using 6 different aerobic and anaerobic agar plates. for aerobic culture, sheep blood agar and chocolate agar (kyokuto pharmaceutical co., tokyo, japan) were used. for anaerobic culture, four different media, 1) brucella hk agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood and defibrillated sheep blood, 2) paramomycin-vancomycin brucella hk agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood, 3) phenylethyl alcohol brucella hk agar with hemolyzed rabbit blood, 4) bacteroides bile esculin agar (kyokuto pharmaceutical co., tokyo, japan) were prepared in an anaerobic jar prior to inoculation. the aerobic agar plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c, and the anaerobic plates at  least 48 h at 37 degrees c in anaerobic jars. from 23 closed odontogenic abscess  samples, a total of 112 bacterial strains were isolated; 81 strains (72.3%) were  strict anaerobes, and 31 strains (27.7%) were aerobes. the mean number of bacterial strains per positive sample was 4.86. oral streptococci, prevotella, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and veillonella were common isolates. the combination of oral streptococci and prevotella was found in 11 patients (47.8%), and that of prevotella and peptostreptococcus in 12 patients (52.2%). the present study demonstrated that closed odontogenic abscesses are polymicrobial infections by aerobes and anaerobes. application of a direct inoculation technique for bacterial culture made it possible to isolate more anaerobes than our commonly used technique using transport medium and to delineate the semiquantitative bacteriology of closed odontogenic abscess.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of macrolides against clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of 6 macrolides was determined using a micro-broth dilution method, against 535 clinical isolates of 22 species, which were isolated in 1996 from 325 facilities in japan. results were as follows. 1. in general, antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were higher than those of 16-membered macrolides. the antimicrobial activities of 14-membered macrolides were in the order of clarithromycin (cam), erythromycin (em), roxithromycin (rxm). among 16-membered macrolides, rokitamycin (rkm) was the most potent, josamycin (jm) was next potent followed by midecamycin (mdm). more numbers of highly-resistant strain of > 100 micrograms/ml were recognized in 14-membered macrolides than in 16-membered macrorides. 2. most of s. pyogenes (group a) strains were distributed in the susceptible range and almost none was found in the resistant range. 3. s. pneumoniae strains were distributed widely from the susceptible range to the highly resistant range, and as high as 37.1% fell into the high resistance of > 100 micrograms/ml range. 4. against peptostreptococcus spp. and mrsa, 16-membered macrolides were more effective than 14-membered macrorlides, and their antibacterial activities were in the order of rkm, jm, mdm. ratio of high-resistant strains of > 100 micrograms/ml against 14-membered macrolides was much higher than that against 16-membered macrolies. 5. most of m. (b.) catarrhalis strains were distributed in the susceptible range of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml, and most of h. influenzae strains were distributed within the moderately resistant and the resistant ranges. 6. in m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae, no correlation between macrolide resistance and beta-lactamase production was recognized. 7. most of c. jejuni strains were susceptible to all macrolides used in this study.

TI  == endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  == microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by streptococcus mutants, porphyromonas endodontalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in il-8 and mcp-1, determined by elisa. the levels induced are physiologically relevant. however, low doses of p. endodontalis were  less effective in inducing il-8 or mcp-1 expression, compared with s. mutants or  p. anaerobius. thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines il-8 and mcp-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. the expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard  to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. these included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses.  a total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). the predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were escherichia coli (60 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (20), streptococcus group d (19), and staphylococcus aureus (11). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), bacteroides fragilis group (66), prevotella species (22), and clostridium species (22). the number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. the number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. these data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. study design: retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. results: specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%),  anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). the predominant isolates were peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group b (4); and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group d, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis (3 each). all patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. six (55%) of the patients died. conclusions: these findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (cam), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cam and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. the results are summarized as follows; 1. it was not showed that cam-resistant strains were increasing among staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma pneumoniae. it appeared that resistances to cam and macrolides (mls) were increasing among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the drug susceptibility patterns to mls were similar and detection frequencies of induced  resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring mls including cam  and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring mls were high among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. it appears that mls-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing mls-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, cam is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, b. pertussis, c. jejuni subsp. jejuni, c. trachomatis and m. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == dental implant infections.
AB  == dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. a tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may  make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. a small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. the microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection.

TI  == increased susceptibility of rag-2 scid mice to dissemination of endodontic infections.
AB  == specific immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions,  although the extent to which these mechanisms are actually involved in either protection or destruction of the pulp-periapex complex is yet to be established.  to investigate this question we compared periapical-lesion pathogenesis in rag-2  severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice with immunocompetent control mice following surgical pulp exposure. in order to equalize the bacterial challenge, an infection protocol using prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius was devised. the results demonstrated that after infection, the proportion of the root canal flora represented by the four pathogens was almost identical in both groups (39.9 and 42.2% for rag-2 and immunocompetent control mice, respectively). the effects of abrogation of t- and b-cell mechanisms on periapical pathogenesis were then assessed. approximately one-third of the rag-2 mice developed endodontic abscesses, while no immunocompetent controls had abscesses, results which indicated regional dissemination of the infection. a similar incidence of abscesses was found in two additional experiments. abscessed rag-2 teeth had significantly larger periapical lesions than did nonabscessed rag-2 teeth (p < or = 0.05) and exposed immunocompetent controls (p < or = 0.01), whereas nonabscessed rag-2 teeth were not significantly different from those of exposed immunocompetent controls in periapical-lesion size. we conclude that b- and t-cell-mediated immunity protects the host from the dissemination of endodontic infections and that rag-2 mice are more susceptible to infection-induced pulp-periapex destruction.

TI  == occurrence of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth: microbiological findings.
AB  == bacterial invasion in roots of periodontally diseased teeth, which has been recently documented using cultural and microscopic techniques, may be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence and the species of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth. samples were taken from the middle layer  of radicular dentin of 26 periodontally diseased teeth. 14 healthy teeth were used as controls. dentin samples were cultured anaerobically. the chosen methodology allowed the determination of the numbers of bacteria present in both  deeper and outer part of dentinal tubules, and the bacterial concentration in dentin samples, expressed as colony forming units per mg of tissue (cfu/mg). invading bacteria was detected in 14 (53.8%) samples from periodontally diseased  teeth. the bacterial concentration ranged from 831.84 to 11971.3 cfu/mg (mean+/-standard deviation: 3043.15+/-2763.13). micro-organisms identified included putative periodontal pathogens such as prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius. these findings suggest that radicular dentin could act as bacterial reservoir from which periodontal pathogens can recolonize treated periodontal pockets, contributing to the failure of therapy and recurrence of disease.

TI  == a microbiological study of pre- and postoperative apicoectomy sites.
AB  == there is little information on the microbiology of periapical lesions, and no data on the residual microbial flora in the periapex, if any, after apicoectomy procedures. hence, 64 patients treated by apicoectomy procedures were prospectively studied to assess the bacterial flora in the periapex and to evaluate the residual bacteria in postoperative apicoectomy sites. of the 64 lesions studied, 14 (22%) were sterile and 50 (78%) yielded bacteria preoperatively. bacteria could be recovered from 28 (56%) of the latter lesions after apicoectomy and curettage. a total of 105 bacterial strains was isolated from 50 lesions, yielding a range of 1-4 (mean 2.1) species per sample. the isolates comprised 84 (80%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (20%) strict anaerobes.  a polymicrobial growth was obtained from 39 lesions whilst 11 lesions yielded pure cultures. on detailed microbiological analyses of 29 lesions, 40% of the isolates were identified as alpha-haemolytic streptococci, half of which were streptococcus sanguis; anaerobic streptococci were the predominant anaerobes. none of the organisms or group(s) of organisms emerged as recalcitrant colonisers which were difficult to dislodge after surgical debridement. these data indicate  that the majority of periapical lesions harbour a variety of flora which cannot be eradicated despite thorough apicoectomy procedures.

TI  == gram-positive resistance: challenge for the development of new antibiotics.
AB  == the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms is increasing despite advances in antibacterial therapy over the last 20 years. as the pathogens causing these infections are frequently resistant to most currently available antibacterials, they are extremely difficult to treat. problematic pathogens include strains of streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides, viridans group streptococci resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, enterococci resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin and highly resistant to penicillins and aminoglycosides, and staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, other beta-lactams, macrolides, lincosamides and aminoglycosides. other important pathogens include streptococcus pyogenes resistant to macrolides (and suspected to be resistant to penicillin), macrolide-resistant streptococci of groups b, c, and g, coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides, multiresistant strains of listeria and corynebacterium and gram-positive anaerobes, such as peptostreptococcus and clostridium, resistant to penicillins and macrolides. thus, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial agents that are able to overcome multidrug-resistant mechanisms. the novel semisynthetic injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin offers the prospect of effective treatment against many of the above pathogens.

TI  == microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  == our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (ni) in children. we used a retrospective review of clinical  microbiology laboratory and patients' records. specimens were obtained from 40 patients with ni lesions and showed bacterial growth. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) (13 isolates), and escherichia coli (1 isolate).  the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented prevotella spp. (5), fusobacterium spp. (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). single bacterial  isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were s. aureus. s. aureus alone or mixed with gabhs or peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. mixed flora of peptostreptococcus spp. with prevotella spp. or fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while e.  coli mixed with b. fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients  (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. this study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of ni lesions.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  == glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. the one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. the results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13c-nmr studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. these oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by streptococcus mutans, and they  effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. in an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by bifidobacteria.

TI  == fungi in therapy-resistant apical periodontitis.
AB  == the occurrence of yeasts in 967 microbiological endodontic samples taken from root canals in persistent endodontic infections was studied. the sampling was done by general practitioners in various parts of finland from root canal infections which did not respond favourably to standard conservative therapy. the samples were cultivated aerobically on a non-selective enriched horse blood agar  medium, on tsbv agar medium in 5% co2 and anaerobically on horse blood agar medium. micro-organisms were found in 692 of the samples while 275 showed no growth. forty-eight fungi were isolated from 47 samples which is 7% of the culture-positive samples. twenty yeast strains were identified further by their colony morphology, growth and cellular characteristics and patterns of carbohydrate assimilation. all isolates except one belonged to the genus candida. candida albicans was the most common species. c. glabrata was found together with c. albicans in one sample. c. guilliermondii, c. inconspicua and geotrichum candidum were each isolated once. yeasts were found in pure culture in six samples and together with bacteria in 41 samples. in all the samples except two,  the accompanying facultative bacteria were gram positive. the most frequent of them were alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococcus species which were found in 31  samples. anaerobic bacteria were isolated together with yeasts from 12 root canals. they included both gram positive species such as peptostreptococcus micros and gram negative species such as fusobacterium nucleatum. the regular isolation of yeasts, also in pure culture, indicates that yeasts may have an important role in cases of apical periodontitis persisting after conventional treatment.

TI  == tissue penetration of meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. the median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/ml. the median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. these tissue concentrations exceed the mics of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. a single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by  susceptible pathogens.

TI  == chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == in children, sinusitis is a common, generally uncomplicated, and self limiting disease which drops with age. the diagnosis is difficult because of relatively non specific signs and symptoms that overlap with viral upper respiratory infection and allergy. plain paranasal sinus radiographs are not adequate, in determining the extent of involvement in recurrent or chronic sinusitis and so ct scan has become the standard. viral illness appears to be the most common predisposing factor. immune defects (mainly ig2 and iga) may exist in a significant percentage of children. the role of allergy seems less important. with advances in the genetic field of cystic fibrosis, genetic factors are advocated in chronic or recurrent sinusitis. the most common bacterial pathogens  in pediatric sinusitis patients are sp (streptococcus pneumoniae), hi (hemophilus influenza) and mc (moraxella catarrhalis). other less frequent bacterial species  include group a streptococcus, group c streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus, moraxella species and eikenella corrodens. respiratory anaerobes are not common. antibiotics resistant to the action of the beta-lactamase are the cornerstone in medical treatment. in recurrent acute sinusitis prophylactic antimicrobials may be helpful. the indication for surgery  remains controversial. to date, we have no prospective studies comparing surgical to medical therapy in order to guide us in deciding surgical indication. it is therefore recommended to follow a conservative track and to limit surgical procedures in children with suppurative complications, nasal obstruction from polyposis or refractory sinusitis aggravating chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  == the aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). the isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from  the species streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus group c, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative rods from the genus haemophilus and rods from the enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of moraxella catarrhalis. the isolated anaerobic microorganisms gram-negative rods from the genus prevotella, bacteroides, fusobacterium, gram-positive cocci from the genus peptostreptococcus. other organisms from the genus vailonella, eubacterium and actinomyces were isolated less frequently. in 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.

TI  == contemporary management of deep neck space infections.
AB  == deep neck infections continue to be seen despite the wide use of antibiotics. these infections follow along fascial planes to create deep neck space abscesses. the clinical presentation often points to the space involved. understanding the regional anatomy gives the surgeon the ability to treat these grave infections. the records of 24 patients with a diagnosis of deep neck space abscess admitted to hermann hospital between 1988 and 1993 were reviewed. fifty percent of the patients had received antibiotics for an infection of the ear, nose, or throat before the development of a neck space abscess. ten patients had parapharyngeal abscesses, seven had retropharyngeal abscesses, six had submandibular space abscesses, and one had parotid space abscess. thirty-five organisms were isolated in 18 cases (1.9 isolates per patient). the most common organism cultured was streptococcus (13 of 18), followed by staphylococcus (6 of 18), bacteroides (5 of 18), micrococcus (2 of 18), and neisseria (2 of 18). one case each of candida, enterobacter, enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, proteus, proprionobacter, and pseudomonas was cultured. six patients had no growth on culture but did have organisms found on gram's stain. the operative techniques and antibiotics used are discussed. the main complications of jugular vein thrombosis, carotid artery  rupture, and mediastinitis are described, as well as an unusual case of meningitis from a large retropharyngeal-parapharyngeal abscess.

TI  == bacteriology of dentoalveolar abscesses in patients who have received empirical antibiotic therapy.
AB  == we investigated aspirates of pus from dentoalveolar abscesses in 13 patients who  had received empirical antibiotic therapy within 1 month before presentation at our facility. the antibiotics administered were lincomycin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, or a cephalosporin. information on antibiotic therapy was obtained from the patients' medical histories. cultures of all dentoalveolar abscesses yielded organisms. a total of 70 isolates (42 anaerobes and 28 facultative organisms) were recovered, representing 5.3 isolates (3.2 anaerobes and 2.1 facultative organisms) per specimen. the counts of bacteria ranged from 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml to 8 x 10(11) cfu/ml (mean count, 1.4 x 10(11) cfu/ml; median count, 2.3 x 10(10) cfu/ml). the predominant isolates were prevotella species (25.7% of isolates), peptostreptococcus species (17.1%), and streptococcus species (14.2%). this study illustrates the polymicrobial nature of dentoalveolar abscesses as well as the predominant role played by anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done  in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. the aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and moraxella catarrhalis (one). three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. these organisms included fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (ad). the objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected ad. methods: a retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained  from patients with secondarily infected ad lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three candida sp. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and escherichia coli in four. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in eight, and fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were s. aureus. twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella, and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. conclusions: the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected ad lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == development and evaluation of a selective and differential medium for the primary isolation of peptostreptococcus micros.
AB  == peptostreptococcus micros, an anaerobic gram-positive coccus, has been associated with periodontal and endodontic lesions, including those refractory to treatment, as well as many human polymicrobial infections in other body locations. a selective and differential medium for the primary isolation of p. micros was developed and evaluated. columbia cna agar, a selective medium for gram-positive  cocci, was supplemented with glutathione and lead acetate (p. micros medium: pmm). p. micros has a characteristic of rapidly utilizing the reduced form of glutathione to form hydrogen sulfide, which reacts with lead acetate producing a  black precipitate in the medium. when grown on pmm, p. micros can be easily identified by its typical colonial morphology and the presence of a black precipitate directly under the colony. pmm was compared for the growth of p. micros with phenylethyl alcohol agar (pea) and columbia base medium (cbm) with 80 strains of p. micros and 30 strains of other gram-positive cocci. all p. micros isolates tested grew and showed the typical morphology of p. micros on pmm. using colony counts on cbm as controls, there was an average 81.8% recovery in the number of p. micros colonies on pmm, in contrast to an average 6.1% recovery on pea. subgingival plaque and tongue samples from 12 adult periodontitis and 6 early-onset periodontitis patients were cultured onto pmm for the isolation of p. micros. p. micros was isolated on pmm and identified biochemically and enzymatically from both adult periodontitis and early-onset periodontitis patients with higher percentages isolated from the diseased periodontal pockets of adult periodontitis patients; furthermore, this is the first isolation of p. micros from tongue samples taken from periodontally diseased patients. this medium in cultural studies will further our understanding and assist future investigations of p. micros involved in disease processes.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == characterization of the binding properties of protein lg, an immunoglobulin-binding hybrid protein.
AB  == protein lg is a 50-kda hybrid molecule containing four ig-light-chain-binding domains from protein l of peptostreptococcus magnus and two igg-fe-binding repeats from streptococcal protein g. here we analyse the binding of protein lg to ig from several mammalian species. protein lg was shown to bind human igg of all subclasses and other ig classes that carry kappa chains. the binding to human igg was only marginally influenced by changes in temperature (4-37 degrees c) or  salt concentration (0-1.6 m), and was stable over a wide ph range (ph 4-10). protein lg bound to ig from 11 of 12 mammalian species, including those of rabbit, mouse and rat. the affinity constants obtained for the interactions between protein lg and polyclonal igg from rabbit (4.0 x 10(9) m-1), mouse (1.7 x 10(9) m-1) and rat (1.3 x 10(9) m-1) were similar to the value previously reported for the interaction between the hybrid protein and human polyclonal igg  (5.9 x 10(9) m-1). the interaction between protein lg and a mouse igg mab was not influenced by the presence of the specific protein antigen, nor was the binding of this antibody to its ligand affected by protein lg. inhibition experiments demonstrated that the ig-binding site of one of the fusion partners retained its  ligand-binding capacity when the other component was occupied. protein lg selectively absorbed 85-90% of the total ig present in human and rabbit sera and  75-80% of the ig in sera from mouse and rat. human serum depleted of c1q, factor  d and properdin and preabsorbed by protein lg could be used as a source for other complement factors. these data demonstrate that protein lg is a very versatile ig-binding protein.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) is a parenteral streptogramin combination antimicrobial that possesses a synergistic and often bactericidal action against many grampositive species. in this study, a collection of 1270 uncommonly isolated or tested strains were evaluated for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin using agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) methods described in the national committe for clinical laboratory standards. the greatest antimicrobial activity observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin was against staphylococci, streptococci, the pathogenic neisseria, legionella spp., lactobacillus spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90 range, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml). marginal activity (mic90s, 4 to 8 micrograms/ml) was identified for the rarer enterococci, leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp., and streptococcus bovis. against haemophilus parainfluenzae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium spp., and prevotella spp., the streptogramin was inactive. although no susceptible breakpoint has been approved  for quinupristin/dalfopristin, three possible breakpoints (< or = 1, < or = 2, or < or = 4 micrograms/ml) were evaluated. acceptance of the lower breakpoints (< or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml) would limit quinupristin/dalfopristin use to staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, and legionella spp. these results markedly expand the understanding of the usable spectrum of quinupristin/dalfopristin.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

AB  == objective: to assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. methods: ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within  15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. demographic, labor,  delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. results: bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (p = .02). isolates included group b streptococcus (n = 5), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of prevotella bivia, g vaginalis,  and viridans streptococci (n = 1). bacteremia was associated with earlier median  gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. conclusion: bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. many of the isolates are capable  of causing endocarditis. appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. results: the predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were prevotella species, fusobacterium species, and peptostreptococcus species. four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (blpos) were  isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 blpos were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). the predominant  blpos in acute sinusitis were h influenzae, and m catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were staphylococcus aureus, prevotella species, fusobacterium species,  and bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained blpos. the detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of blpos in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against clinical isolates].
AB  == to examine the antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients in 1994, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for cam and the control drugs. the results were as follows; 1. mic50 and mic90 of cam were similar to those investigated in 1980's against many bacterial species. 2. cam showed strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni and peptostreptococcus spp. 3. it appears that resistance to mls including cam is increasing among streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 s. uberis isolates, 3 s. acidominimus isolates, 2 streptococcus spp., 15 peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. all isolates except one bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin g, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the b. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (mic90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (mic90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). similar trends were noted for  susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (mic90s, 2.0 and  8 micrograms/ml, respectively). occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. tinidazole was  active against all anaerobes (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-lactamase was produced only by the b. fragilis isolate.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. this has been associated with patency of  dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or  not. it was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. the significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.

TI  == microbiological features and pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  == samples of pus aspirated from 53 peritonsillar abscesses were examined in detail  for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and the microbiological results correlated with clinical data in 44 cases. in 45 samples (85%) cultures were positive: 7 yielded organisms consistent with an aerobic infection, mainly lancefield group a beta-haemolytic streptococci (5/7), and 38 yielded organisms consistent with an anaerobic infection. the anaerobic infections were usually mixed, but in two cases fusobacterium necrophorum was isolated in pure culture. peptostreptococcus  micros and streptococcus milleri were the predominant isolates in this group. direct gram stain smear and gas-liquid chromatography were useful indicators of the type of infection present. samples from ten patients (18.9%) grew one or more beta-lactamase-producing isolates. of the 25 patients prescribed antibiotics by their general practitioners prior to admission, 18 received one or more beta-lactam antibiotics. most cases of peritonsillar abscess were due to mixed anaerobic infections, lancefield group a beta-haemolytic streptococci playing a central role in only a minority of cases. in light of these findings and the possibility of infection with beta-lactamase-producing isolates, it is suggested  that the first-line antibiotic therapy in this group of patients should include a chemotherapeutic agent directed against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == multiple ligand interactions for bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins on human and murine cells of the hematopoetic lineage.
AB  == a group of bacterial ig-binding surface proteins were studied: protein h and m1 are from streptococcus pyogenes and interact with igg, protein l is expressed by  peptostreptococcus magnus and shows affinity for ig light chains, whereas protein lg is a chimeric construction combining the binding properties of protein l with  the igg-binding activity of protein g from group c and g streptococci. proteins l and h coupled to sepharose were mitogenic for human peripheral blood lymphocytes  (pbl) and mouse splenic b cells, but not when added in soluble form. differentiation to ig secretion was induced by protein h-sepharose in mouse splenic b cells but not in human pbls. in facs analysis fitc-labelled protein h stained virtually all cd19+ cells in human peripheral blood as well as a majority of the cd3+ population. protein l bound the majority of the cd19+ population, but also a fraction of the cd19-/cd3 population. protein m1 was not mitogenic but stained the entire cd19+ population and 70% of the cd3+ population. identical staining patterns were observed with mouse splenocytes using b220 and t-cells receptor as lineage markers. the chimeric protein lg was a potent mitogen for mouse splenic b cells when added either coupled to sepharose or in soluble form.  in addition, protein lg induced differentiation to ig secretion of the responding mouse splenic b cells. in facs analysis, protein lg stained the entire cd19+ and  the majority of the cd19-/cd3 lymphocyte population as well as all b220+ mouse splenocytes and a fraction of the splenic t cells. these data indicate that the bacterial proteins studied interact with surface structures of several leucocyte  populations and can hence interfere with the immune system at multiple levels.

TI  == an approach to efficacy screening of mouthrinses: studies on a group of french products (i). staining and antimicrobial properties in vitro.
AB  == there is a large and increasing number of oral hygiene products available to the  general public. as such, it is difficult to demonstrate efficacy for all in long-term home-use studies. the aim of this project was to determine whether screening studies could position the activity and efficacy of a number of antiseptic mouthrinses, available in france, by comparison with an established product. this study reports the experiments in vitro. the products under test were, 4 containing chlorhexidine (eludril, hibident, parodex and prexidine) with  hibident considered the positive control, one containing cetylpyridinium chloride (alodont) and one containing hexetidine (hextril). the 1st study determined the antibacterial profile of the chlorhexidine products against a panel of oral bacteria using an agar dilution method. the 2nd study recorded, by optical density, the propensity of all products to induce tea staining on clear acrylic specimens. the maximum inhibitory dilution (mid) of the chlorhexidine products against the test organisms, once adjusted for initial concentration differences,  were essentially similar. one exception was eludril which had an increased mid against capnocytophaga sputigena, an organism normally less sensitive to chlorhexidine. hibident and prexidine produced expected levels of tea staining; that produced by parodex was lower than the expected. staining by eludril was little different than water controls suggesting markedly reduced availability of  chlorhexidine in this product.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == endodontic pathogens in periodontal disease augmentation.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. this has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: the experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. it was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

AB  == protein l is a cell surface protein expressed by some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species peptostreptococcus magnus. the molecule binds specifically and  with high affinity to immunoglobulins (ig) of a wide range of animal species. the ig-binding activity is mediated through five highly homologous domains, each 72 to 76 amino acid residues long, which interact with framework regions in the variable domain of ig light chains. the interaction does not interfere with the antigen binding capacity of the antibody. the fold of the ig light chain-binding  domains of protein l is comprised of an alpha-helix packed against a four stranded beta-sheet and is similar to the fold of the igg heavy chain-binding domains of streptococcal protein g, despite the fact that the two proteins show no significant sequence homology. in the present work, heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy has been utilized to define the interaction between the n-terminal ig-binding domain of protein l and the variable domain of a human ig kappa light  chain. the ig-binding region of the protein l domain involves most of the residues in the second beta-strand, the c-terminal residues of the alpha-helix and the loop connecting the alpha-helix with the third beta-strand. the ig light  chain-binding surface of protein l thus resembles the surface of protein g which  binds to the c gamma 1 domain of igg, but is different from the portion of protein g involved in the contact with the c gamma 2-c gamma 3 interface region.  the data suggest that the global fold shared by the ig-binding domains of proteins l and g provide bacteria with a flexible template for the evolution of surface structures capable of interacting with different conserved parts of ig molecules of the infected host.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of streptococcus hansenii and peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  == the 16s rrna gene sequence of the type strain of ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus ruminococcus, was determined by pcr direct sequencing.  a comparative sequence analysis showed that r. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster iv of collins et al. [m. d. collins, p. a. lawson, a. willems, j. j. cordoba, j. fernandez-garayzabal, p. garcia, j. cai, h. hippe, and j. a. e. farrow, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several clostridium and eubacterium species. r. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques, peptostreptococcus productus, and streptococcus hansenii. these findings demonstrate that the genus ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of p. productus and s. hansenii to this genus (t. ezaki, n. li, y. hashimoto, h. miura, and h. yamamoto, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == factors affecting the occurrence of bacteremia associated with tooth extraction.
AB  == this study examined the factors that affect the occurrence of bacteremia associated with tooth extraction and the kinds of bacteria causing this bacteremia. bacteremia was found in 132 (72.1%) of 183 patients who had one or more teeth extracted for various reasons. bacteremia occurred more frequently when teeth were extracted because of inflammatory dental diseases. the occurrence of bacteremia also increased with the number of teeth extracted and the age of the patients. when the volume of blood lost during surgery was > 50 ml and the time required for the operation exceeded 100 min, the occurrence of bacteremia was also higher. anaerobes were isolated from 104 (78.8%) of the 132 cases of bacteremia. of the 187 isolates obtained, three (1.6%) were aerobes, 51 (27.3%) were facultative anaerobes (including microaerophils), and 133 (71.1%) were anaerobes. among facultative anaerobes and microaerophils, the most frequently isolated bacterial genera were lactobacillus (n = 15), streptococcus (n = 13), and staphylococcus (n = 12); and among anaerobes, eubacterium (n = 40), peptostreptococcus (n = 40), and propionibacterium (n = 20).

TI  == surgical sepsis: constancy of antibiotic susceptibility of causative organisms.
AB  == background: it is well documented that antibiotic therapy exerts selective pressure on bacteria. conversion of bacteria from susceptible to resistant to antibiotics has been observed often during antimicrobial therapy. it has been postulated that human intestinal reservoirs facilitate communication of transposons that can transfer resistance determinants among various bacterial species. methods: this study examined the susceptibilities of organisms isolated  from infected abdomens to a number of antibiotic agents during a 12-year time interval. analysis included 1102 isolates recovered from 255 specimens, representing the following genera: bacteroides, clostridium, gemella, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas, prevotella, enterococcus, staphylococcus, streptococcus, pseudomonas, and enterobacteriaceae. strains were  tested against beta-lactam agents, beta-lactams in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, first, second, and third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, and imipenem. results: the results indicated that during a time period of more than a decade essentially no change occurred in the antibiotic susceptible fraction of all species tested. conclusions: abdominal sepsis is caused by leakage of endogenous  intestinal flora. this study suggests that the intestinal flora is not permanently affected by short-term antibiotic therapy and that older antibiotics  are appropriate first-line therapeutic agents for community-acquired infections caused by normal intestinal flora.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

TI  == intracranial complications of sinusitis in childhood.
AB  == complications of sinusitis in children, such as intracranial abscess formation, are uncommon and are often clinically unremarkable in comparison to similar disease processes in adults. between 1983 and 1991, 443 children were admitted to children's national medical center in washington, dc, for treatment of sinusitis. fourteen of these children presented with intracranial extension of the infection and abscess formation. a retrospective review of these patients revealed that the risk of developing an intracranial abscess secondary to sinusitis was 3%. the management of these patients included surgical drainage of the infected sinuses and intracranial surgical exploration. cranialization and exenteration of the frontal sinus proved to be effective single-stage procedures. while not indicated in all patients, these procedures eliminated the sinus as a source of continued or potential infection and obviated the need for a second obliterative procedure. combined antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage should be the management protocol.

TI  == on the interaction between single chain fv antibodies and bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins.
AB  == using four bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins, we have analyzed the binding characteristics of a panel of 34 human single chain fv antibodies, expressed in e. coli and with known specificity and sequence. several of the single chain fv antibodies showed affinity for staphylococcal protein a and peptostreptococcal protein l, but not for the streptococcal proteins g or h. the  affinity of the binding was higher for protein l (4.5 and 1.4 x 10(9) m-1) than for protein a (7.7 and 6.7 x 10(8) m-1), using the two single chain fv antibodies displaying the strongest binding activity to these ligands. the binding was shown to be specific by western blotting, and the single chain fv antibodies could be purified from crude bacterial culture media by affinity chromatography on protein l- or a-sepharose. protein a, which has affinity for the vh domain of the scfv antibodies, was tested against scfv antibodies containing vh1, vh3, vh4 and vh5 domains, and its binding was restricted to approximately half of the scfv antibodies with a vh3 domain. protein l, which has affinity for the vl domain, was tested against kappa 1, kappa 4, lambda 1, lambda 2 and lambda 3 domains, and it bound all kappa 1 domains, one lambda 2 and one lambda 3 domain. comparison of the amino acid sequences of binding and non-binding vl domains demonstrated that  amino acid residues crucial to the binding of protein l were distributed over a large area outside the hypervariable antigen-binding regions.

(52 cases), h. influenzae (32 cases) and s. aureus (29 cases) in patients with pneumonia or lung abscess and h. influenzae (174 cases), s. pneumoniae (84 cases), p. aeruginosa (81 cases) and m. catarrhalis (42 cases) in patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. anaerobic bacteria isolated from tta included peptostreptococcus sp. (19 cases), bacteroides sp. (19 cases) and others. mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated from tta in 8 patients with pneumonia without  other organisms. virus isolated from tta included rhinovirus (6 cases) and others. these results suggest that various pathogens affect the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary infection. therefore, we must diagnose the bronchopulmonary infection by the correct methods such as tta.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == impaired bactericidal activity of pmn from two brothers with necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis (anup) diagnosed in two brothers, age 9 (anup1)  and 14 (anup2) from rural egypt. complete blood count, differential and blood chemistry were within normal limits for both brothers and they were not malnourished. the phagocytosis and killing function of their polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) towards four bacterial species were assessed using a fluorochrome microassay. the selection of bacterial species was based on preliminary microbiological results in early onset periodontitis in egypt. fluorochrome-labeled prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were pre-opsonized with anup serum and added to pmn from both anup patients, as well as pmn from three sex-matched and two sex- and age-matched healthy egyptian control (ctl) subjects. we found significant depressions (p < 0.05) in pmn phagocytosis and killing of c. rectus and p. intermedia by anup1 and anup2, when compared to all ctl pmn. an assessment of the gram-negative subgingival microflora present in both anup patients (in colony forming unit percent of total cfu recovered) (cfu %) revealed the presence of p. intermedia (anup1, 41.7 cfu %; anup2, 14.8 cfu %), fusobacterium nucleatum (anup1, 3.6 cfu %; anup2, 48.1 cfu %), and veillonella spp. (anup1, 18.2 cfu %; anup2, 18.5 cfu %). spirochetes were also observed in cytocentrifuged, gram-stained plaque from both anup patients. the predominant gram-positive bacterial species recovered from both nug1 and nug2 was streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == bacteria invading periapical cementum.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms invade periapical cementum of human teeth from the adjacent periapical lesions. we therefore attempted to isolate microorganisms from periapical cementum through the adoption of standard anaerobic procedures for obligate anaerobes. samples of cementum were taken from 10 amputated tooth roots at the time of apicoectomy. from two of these samples, bacteria were recovered after anaerobic incubation, but no bacteria were recovered after aerobic incubation of the same samples. of a total of eight isolates from the cementum, seven were obligate anaerobes and one was aerotolerant. the obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to the genera prevotella, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, and fusobacterium. the aerotolerant  anaerobe was campylobacter. from this, we conclude that bacteria can successfully invade cementum via periapical periodontal tissue, and that such bacteria may play a significant role in chronic periapical pathosis.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefteram against recently clinically detected and isolated strains from patients with dental infections].
AB  == to investigate the antibiotic activity of cefteram (cftm), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cftm and of the control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from november 1991 to april 1993 from 19 dental facilities throughout the country, as well as against clinically isolated  strains from samples obtained at this center from patients with dental infectious diseases, and the following results were obtained. 1. 430 strains were detected in 198 cases but identified strains amounted to 425. they are comprised of 204 strains of oral streptococci (48.0%), 81 strains of peptostreptococcus spp. (19.1%), 10 strains of bacteroides spp. (2.4%), 23 strains of prevotella spp. (5.4%), and 9 strains of porphyromonas spp. (2.1%). the ratios of gram-positive bacteria v.s. gram-negative bacteria were 78.4% and 21.6%, respectively, and the  gram-positive bacteria were isolated at higher frequency than gram-negative bacteria. 2. the mic90's of cftm against oral streptococci and peptostreptococcus spp. were 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.05 microgram/ml, and year to year increases of  incidences of resistance against cftm were not observed. some strains, however, appeared to have obtained resistance to cftm. 3. among bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp. which used to belong to genus bacteroides, there were some strains resistant to cftm. as a whole, however, no year to year increases in the incidence of cftm resistance among these strains also. 4. two strains of 6 staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus were methicillin-resistant. 5. the above observations indicate that cftm still shows strong antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated strains that may be involved in dental infections.

TI  == bacterial colonization and degradation of demineralized dentin matrix in situ.
AB  == lesion formation in dentin involves demineralization followed by degradation of the exposed organic matrix. proteinases from microorganisms present in the dentin are believed to play an important role in the breakdown of the dentinal collagen. in this study, the microflora colonizing decalcified dentin matrix, placed in situ, was identified. the gelatinolytic activity of the isolated strains was assessed and related to the degradation of the dentin matrix. the predominant species found were streptococcus mitis. peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium species and veillonella parvula. marked interindividual variation in the composition of the microflora was observed. the  microflora possessed gelatinolytic activity, although no correlation was found with the severity of dentin matrix degradation. the chemically determined loss of collagen varied between 0 and 67 wt% per participant and corresponded with the extent of collagen degradation observed by transmission electron microscopy.

TI  == 16s ribosomal dna sequences of anaerobic cocci and proposal of ruminococcus hansenii comb. nov. and ruminococcus productus comb. nov.
AB  == the 16s ribosomal dna sequences of representative members of the family peptococcaceae were determined. the members of the family examined were divided into the following four phylogenetic groups: peptococcus niger atcc 27731t (t = type strain), the sarcina-peptostreptococcus anaerobius group, the ruminococcus-coprococcus group, and the peptostreptococcus group. peptococcus niger, the type species of the family, was not related to other members of the family. peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc 27337t, the type strain of the type species of the genus peptostreptococcus, was closely related to clostridium sordellii ncib 10717t (level of sequence similarity, 85%). sarcina ventriculi gifu 7886, a spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive coccus, clustered with clostridium perfringens atcc 13124t at a similarity value of 91%. members of the  sarcina-peptostreptococcus anaerobius group clustered with clostridia at similarity values ranging from 85 to 91%. the type strains of peptostreptococcus  prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus magnus clustered at levels of sequence homology of 84 to 93%.  this cluster was not included in the peptococcus niger group or the peptostreptococcus anaerobius group. thus, these members of the genus peptostreptococcus should be separated from the other members of the genus and also from members of the family peptococcaceae. the sequence of peptostreptococcus productus atcc 27340t was different from the sequences of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus niger. the sequence of streptococcus hansenii atcc 27752t, a strictly anaerobic strain, was different from the sequences of other streptococci; this strain clustered with peptostreptococcus productus, coprococci, and ruminococci. several phenotypic characteristics of streptococcus hansenii atcc 27752t were similar to characteristics of ruminococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == an in-vitro study of the comparative viability on different swab types of simulated specimens of bacteria commonly present in oro-facial infections.
AB  == an in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of amies transport medium. standard inocula of pure cultures of streptococcus milleri, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked  on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation.  differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. recovery of prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. we conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

TI  == a review of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics in general dentistry.
AB  == the microflora associated with odontogenic infections are typically mixed and of  indigenous origin. streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and actinomyces species are the principle microflora isolated from these infections. penicillin v (phenoxymethyl penicillin) remains the antimicrobial of choice for the initial empirical treatment of odontogenic infections. this agent is safe, highly effective and inexpensive. amoxicillin has little indication for the routine treatment of odontogenic infections. however, it is the agent of choice for endocarditis prophylaxis, as it produces higher serum levels than penicillin v. erythromycin may be used for mild, acute odontogenic infections in penicillin-allergic patients. the high incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances and superinfection commonly associated with the ingestion of tetracycline limits its role in general dental practice. tetracycline may be considered as an alternative therapy for penicillin-allergic  patients over the age of 13 who cannot tolerate erythromycin. clindamycin is very effective against all odontogenic pathogens, but its potential gastrointestinal toxicity relegates it to third- or even fourth-line therapy in general dentistry. although metronidazole displays excellent activity against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, it is only moderately effective against facultative and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and should not be used alone in the treatment of acute odontogenic infections.

AB  == odontogenic infections rarely lead to involvement of the lateral and retropharyngeal spaces. when this does occur, the microbiology of the infection is similar to the typical odontogenic infection, ie, streptococcus and oral anaerobes including peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, and fusobacterium. there is  an increased incidence of fusobacterium seen in the more severe infections, as well as a higher incidence of streptococcus milleri. many patients who have deep  cervical infections also have some compromise in their host defense mechanism, such as diabetes. the signs and symptoms of deep cervical space infections are similar to those of the severe submandibular space infection, but also includes sialorrhea, respiratory distress, odynophagia, and dysphagia. lateral soft-tissue radiographs of the neck are useful in assisting with the diagnosis of retropharyngeal infections, and ct scans can provide definitive information regarding lateral pharyngeal space involvement. treatment includes the use of high-dose intravenous bacteriocidal antibiotics. the recommended antibiotics are  penicillin-metronidazole, ampicillin-sulbactam, or clindamycin. certain cephalosporins may also be useful in selected patients. early surgical intervention is also indicated. aggressive incision and drainage of all of the involved spaces is necessary to assure early resolution of the infection. continual airway monitoring and the establishment of surgical airways is the final portion of the treatment triad.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [the role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  == altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species peptococcus  asacharolyticus, pc. sacharolyticus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides asacharolyticus and b. melaninogenicus. the remaining isolates were classified as bacteroides, fusobacterium, streptococcus and clostridium. in the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (tab. i) were carried out. their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (tab. ii). capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (tab. iii). in the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. the anaerobic genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of  the samples both species occurred). according to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. of the latter, those belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium are of major importance.

TI  == protein lg: a hybrid molecule with unique immunoglobulin binding properties.
AB  == immunoglobulin (ig)-binding bacterial proteins have attracted theoretical interest for their role in molecular host-parasite interactions, and they are widely used as tools in immunology, biochemistry, medicine, and biotechnology. protein l of the anaerobic bacterial species peptostreptococcus magnus binds ig light chains, whereas streptococcal protein g has affinity for the constant (fc)  region of igg. in this report, ig binding parts of protein l and protein g were combined to form a hybrid molecule, protein lg, which was found to bind a large majority of intact human igs as well as fc and fab fragments, and ig light chains. binding to ig was specific, and the affinity constants of the reactions between protein lg and human igg, iggfc fragments, and kappa light chains, determined by scatchard plots, were 5.9 x 10(9), 2.2 x 10(9), and 2.0 x 10(9) m-1, respectively. the binding properties of protein lg were more complete as compared with previously described ig-binding proteins when also tested against mouse and rat igs. this hybrid protein thus represents a powerful tool for the binding, detection, and purification of antibodies and antibody fragments.

TI  == physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of peptostreptococcus  micros and streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

(16), and escherichia coli (6). the predominant anaerobes included bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 bacteroides fragilis group) and peptostreptococcus sp. (11). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were s. aureus. twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. these included 16 s. aureus and 6 b. fragilis group. these data  highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.

AB  == the bacteriology of chronic sinusitis has been reported in several studies, but there have been few bacteriological studies on paranasal cyst. also, details of the techniques of transportation and processing of clinical specimens have only rarely been described. therefore, this study was undertaken with attention to the above, and to obtain information on appropriate antimicrobial therapy, we conducted a dilution antimicrobial susceptibility test of isolates. fifteen patients with paranasal cyst participated in this study. their lesions were frontal sinus (3), ethmoid sinus (2), sphenoid sinus (2) and maxillary sinus (8). we punctured the cyst using an 18-gauge needle attached to a syringe at the time  of operation, and paranasal cyst effusions were promptly transported to the laboratory. the specimen was immediately inoculated under a set of aerobic and prereduced anaerobic plates, which were incubated in appropriate conditions. most specimens were completely processed within one hour. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates was done with mic panel by the sceptor system. positive results of bacterial cultures were found in 60% of all cases (all of the frontal  sinus specimens and half of those with other lesions). a total of 38 bacteria, including 24 anaerobic and 14 aerobic species, were isolated from 9 paranasal cysts, yielding an average of 4.2 species per positive case (2.9 anaerobes and 1.3 aerobes). monomicrobial flora were found, anaerobes only in 2 cases and aerobes only in 2 others. mixed flora were found in 5 cases in which both anaerobes and aerobes were isolated. the bacterial concentration in the maximal case was 4.9 x 10(4) cfu/ml. the organisms most frequently isolated were propionibacterium spp. (7), peptostreptococcus spp. (7), staphylococcus spp. (7), prevotella spp. (5) and streptococcus spp. (4). on the basis of the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates in vitro, the use of cephems, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, norfloxacin and chloramphenicol proved to be clinically effective.

AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == diagnosis and management of parotitis.
AB  == of all the salivary glands, the parotid gland is most commonly affected by an inflammatory process. infections of the parotid gland range from acute to severe. assessment of the disease process should differentiate local primary parotid infection from systemic infection when this gland is also involved as part of a generalized inflammatory condition. viral parotitis can be caused by paramyxovirus (mumps), epstein-barr virus, coxsackievirus, and influenza a and parainfluenza viruses. acute suppurative parotitis is generally caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus species, and rarely, gram-negative bacteria. anaerobic bacteria, mostly peptostreptococcus species and bacteroides species, and pigmented porphyromonas species and prevotella species have been recently recognized as an important cause of this infection. beta-lactamase-producing organisms can be isolated in almost three fourths of the patients. predisposing factors to suppurative infections are dehydration, malnutrition, oral neoplasms,  immunosuppuration, sialolithiasis, and medications that diminish salivation. pus, aspirated from a suppurative parotic abscess, should be plated on media that are  supportive for the growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. early and proper antimicrobial therapy may prevent suppuration. initial empiric therapy that is directed against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria may  be required until a specific causal diagnosis is available. surgical drainage may be indicated when pus has formed. this may prevent complications and facilitate recovery.

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) in children. the results are summarized as follow: 1. twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with papm/bp. each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. treatments were continued for 5-22 days. clinical efficacies of papm/bp in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected  sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate  of 91.7%. seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (haemophilus influenzae in 4, branhamella catarrhalis in 3, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-streptococcus in 1, corynebacterium sp. in 1, peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (s. aureus and p. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient no. 2). no adverse reactions were observed in any of the  12 patients. 2. mics of papm were examined against 22 clinical isolates (h. influenzae 5, b. catarrhalis 3, alpha-streptococcus 3, s. pneumoniae 2, corynebacterium sp. 2, s. aureus 1, p. aeruginosa 1, p. micros 1, enterobacter cloacae 1, escherichia coli 1, group d streptococcus 1 and staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. papm showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (cpz) against s. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. however, the activity of papm against h. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of cpz. 3. pharmacokinetic studies.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == in vitro activities of three semisynthetic amide derivatives of teicoplanin, mdl  62208, mdl 62211, and mdl 62873.
AB  == mdl 62208, mdl 62211, and mdl 62873 are three semisynthetic amide derivatives of  teicoplanin (mdl 62208 is an amide of teicoplanin aglycone, mdl 62211 is an amide of the teicoplanin a2 complex, and mdl 62873 is the corresponding derivative of peak a2-2 of the complex). the three semisynthetic glycopeptides were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity in comparison with the parent drug (teicoplanin) and vancomycin. a variety of gram-positive bacteria of clinical origin, whose species were carefully determined and that included 428 staphylococci (207 methicillin susceptible and 221 methicillin resistant), 41 streptococci, 82 enterococci, 43 strains of listeria monocytogenes, 10 jk coryneform bacteria, and 67 anaerobes belonging to the genera clostridium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, and eubacterium, were tested. the only resistances to mdl 62208, mdl 62211, and mdl 62873 were encountered with vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterococci. all of the other test strains, including some teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci of the species staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus epidermidis, were highly susceptible to the three teicoplanin amides. only minor differences in activity were observed among mdl 62208, mdl 62211, and mdl 62873, whereas the three experimental compounds were usually found to be more potent than teicoplanin or vancomycin (especially against staphylococci, with differences mostly ranging from 2- to 16-fold). the mbc-to-mic ratios varied depending on the organisms, with the highest ratios usually observed for enterococci and listeriae. overall,  the mbc-to-mic ratios yielded by the teicoplanin analogs were slightly greater than those yielded by teicoplanin or vancomycin.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == predominant obligate anaerobes in human periodontal pockets.
AB  == this study was carried out to investigate the predominant anaerobic bacteria of periodontal pockets in patients with advanced periodontitis, who had no previous  treatment other than supragingival scaling, no history of recent or chronic systemic illness, nor any intake of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to bacteriological sampling. care was taken not to ignore tiny-colony-forming anaerobes, by means of a stereoscope and an anaerobic glove box system. out of 422 (100%) isolates, 380 (90%) were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that the environment in periodontal pockets was anaerobic and favors the growth of obligate anaerobes. among the 380 obligate anaerobes isolated, strains belonging  to eubacterium (54%) were predominant, and many of them occurred in tiny colonies. the other obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to wolinella (9%),  unidentified motile rods which resemble wolinella (7%), peptostreptococcus (6%),  fusobacterium (5%), bacteroides (2%; including those reclassified to prevotella and porphyromonas) and selenomonas (0.5%). among the isolates, 67% were gram-positive bacteria, including 59% of rods (mostly asaccharolytic eubacterium), suggesting that these bacteria, particularly strains of the eubacterium species, may play an important role in etiology of adult periodontitis.

TI  == the relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == bacterial invasion of non-exposed dental pulp.
AB  == anaerobic procedures were adopted to demonstrate the early bacterial invasion of  non-exposed dental pulps, and to isolate and identify the bacteria. of 19 freshly extracted teeth which originally exhibited deep dentinal lesions, clinical examination and electric pulp testing showed that nine of them had no pulpal exposure. thus the pulps of these teeth were covered by clinically sound dentine  beneath the carious lesion. bacteria were found to have invaded the pulps of six  of these nine teeth. the predominant bacteria were obligate anaerobes belonging to the genera eubacterium, propionibacterium and actinomyces. other obligate anaerobes were lactobacillus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and streptococcus.  the bacterial composition resembled that of the deep layers of dentinal lesions described previously, suggesting that the bacteria isolated in this study had passed through some individual dentinal tubules, to invade the dental pulp.

TI  == [analysis of 98 cases of thoracic empyema].
AB  == ninety-eight cases of empyema thoracis admitted to juntendo university hospital between 1979 and 1990 were reviewed. males accounted for 78 cases and females 20  cases. thirteen pediatric patients ranged in age from 17 days to 4 years, while the 85 adult cases ranged from 16 to 89 years (mean: 58.4 years). the mortality rate increased with age. fifty-three cases of community-acquired empyema thoracis consisted of 24 with no underlying disease (including 13 pediatric cases), and 29 with diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver damage or chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. forty-five nosocomial empyema cases occurred after chest operation or thoracocentesis, or due to a subdiaphragmatic pathogenic condition or congestive heart failure complicated with aspiration pneumonia. in this series, 63 patients (64.3%) had para- or post-pneumonic empyema. compared with the community-acquired infection cases, the mortality rate of the nosocomial infection cases was very high. seventy-eight cases were culture-positive, including 3 positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis. the remaining 20 cases were  culture-negative. in 75 cases of culture-positive pleural fluid, aerobic bacteria were isolated from 31 cases (mortality rate: 22.6%), anaerobes mixed with aerobes from 21 cases (mortality rate: 52.4%), and anaerobes only from 23 cases (mortality rate: 21.7%). thus, the mortality rate of mixed infected cases was highest. anaerobes were frequently isolated from the community-acquired empyema cases, and were often found in para- or postpneumonic lesions, including aspiration pneumonia. the most commonly encountered aerobe was staphylococcus aureus. among the anaerobes, bacteroides spp., microaerophilic streptococcus, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. were most common. a single organism was isolated in pure culture from 39 cases. single organisms isolated from fluids were more frequently aerobes (25) than anaerobes (14). the cases harboring bacteroides spp. showed the worst outcome, with 11 deaths in 25 such cases.

TI  == [empyema due to an anaerobic streptococcus in childhood].
AB  == anaerobic infections are quite rare in pediatric age, being that, they affect only neonates and immunodepressed patients. we think to be somewhat interesting to describe the case of our patient, a 9 year old boy, unaffected by any predisposing factor, came under our observation because of a severe respiratory distress. he showed evident clinical and radiological signs of pleural effusion in the right lung, together with a gas coil in the upper field and a left mediastinal shifting. a thoracentesis was then performed, giving rise to 600 ml of foul smelling purulent material; this procedure promptly improved his respiratory function. a permanent drainage trough the chest wall was set and an antibiotic therapy, based on the clinical picture and the character of the exudate, begun. in effect, the typical smell of the purulent material led us to suspect an anaerobic infection, and for this reason we employed the teicoplanin iv, a rarely used in the pediatric age drug. while blood cultures were negative for any organism, exudate cultures yielded peptostreptococcus anaerobius; the last one resulted highly sensible following antibiogram to the previously chosen  drug. the x-ray pattern and the rapid disappearing of the gas coil induced us to  exclude further either congenital or acquired lung diseases. we conclude that, in absence of other proved sources of entry, the air presence in the pleural space was secondary to gas formation by the anaerobic micro-organism. the clinical course was very satisfactory allowing the patient to be dismissed on the 28th hospital day, with no need of further surgical therapy.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == chorioamnion infection is associated with histologic chorioamnionitis and prematurity, but the specific chorioamnion microorganisms associated with histologic chorioamnionitis, prematurity, and poor neonatal outcome have not been identified. bacteria were recovered from the chorioamnion cultures of 32% of 112  placentas delivered at less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation and from 19% of  156 placentas delivered at greater than 34 weeks' gestation (odds ratio 2.1; 95%  confidence interval 1.1 to 3.8). chorioamnion bacteria most highly related to both prematurity and histologic chorioamnionitis were group b streptococcus and fusobacterium species. chorioamnion infection with peptostreptococcus was significantly related only to preterm delivery, and infection with escherichia coli, bacteroides, and ureaplasma were significantly related to histologic chorioamnionitis. among preterm infants, isolation of bacteria from the chorioamnion was related to an increased risk of neonatal death (rate ratio 3.8;  95% confidence interval 1.4 to 11.6). bacterial infection of the chorioamnion is  related to preterm birth, histologic chorioamnionitis, and neonatal death.

AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == effects of propicillin on mixed continuous cultures of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == experiments were designed to test the antibiotic (1-phenoxypropyl)penicillin (propicillin) against a complex microflora of periodontal bacteria. this was accomplished by using a continuously growing mixed culture that was obtained by enrichment of periodontal plaque in human serum. peptostreptococcus species, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus, catenaforme, and streptococcus species were dominant members of the enrichment culture. none of the strains isolated from the enrichment culture exhibited detectable beta-lactamase activity. mics of propicillin for the organisms ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 mg/liter. propicillin was added to the cultures in single doses that were repeated once or twice at 24-h intervals, that is, after 2.4 volume changes of the culture vessel. analyses done 24 h after the last addition of propicillin revealed that total cell counts of the culture were hardly affected by 1 mg of propicillin per liter, although some  changes in the microbial composition occurred. the relative insusceptibility of the culture might be explained by the low growth rate. higher concentrations (5,  10, and 50 mg/liter) of the antibiotic caused 10- to 20-fold drops in total cell  counts. in these cultures p. intermedia was selectively suppressed to below the detection level, whereas other organisms that were equally susceptible to propicillin were less affected. it was concluded that mixed continuous cultures are a useful tool for studying the effects of antibiotics against the periodontal microbiota.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == clinical and microbiological findings on newly inserted hydroxyapatite-coated and pure titanium human dental implants.
AB  == the clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (tri-stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium  implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. in 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. all patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture  exposure. clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the florida probe system. subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in vmga iii. specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. no significant  mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths,  bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of fusobacterium species and peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. one or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. the prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.

TI  == [randomized study of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid versus amoxicillin-metronidazole combinations in pyogenic infections of dental origin].
AB  == thirty patients, without any valve defect, cardiac malformation or previous antibiotic administration and presenting dental infections, have been treated either with amoxycillin-clavulanic acid or amoxycillin and metronidazole. aerobic and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated. these infections were due to mixed flora. nearly one half of anaerobes were peptostreptococcus, s. milleri and s. sanguis being predominant among aerobes. the species identified were those found  in the mouth in the absence of infection becoming as opportunistic flora. the percentage of cures was equivalent in the two groups. the association amoxycillin-clavulanic acid seems to be as active as amoxycillin + metronidazole  on the microflora isolated from dentogenous pyogenic infections.

TI  == bacteriological investigations of clinical mastitis in heifers in sweden.
AB  == bacterial analyses were carried out of 2069 udder secretions, isolated from 1481  heifers with mastitis in eight veterinary districts in sweden. streptococci, e.g. streptococcus dysgalactiae and str. uberis, dominated the bacterial flora, being  isolated from 34.4 and 19.5% respectively of heifers with clinical mastitis occurring from puberty up to 14 d post partum. bacterial species generally regarded as important pathogens in the summer mastitis complex, e.g. actinomyces  pyogenes, stuart-schwan coccus and strictly anaerobic bacteria such as peptostreptococcus indolicus, fusobacterium necrophorum and bacteroides melaninogenicus were isolated at low frequencies (13.2, 6.3, 9.4, 3.8 and 1.3% respectively). when the cases of mastitis studied were restricted to those appearing in heifers pre partum, may 15 to october 14 (summer mastitis), these bacterial species were isolated at higher percentages (27.1, 14.4, 21.4, 13.5 and 5.2% respectively). these figures were, nevertheless, still lower than those published in reports from other countries. whether considered up to 14 d post partum or only pre partum, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of a. pyogenes isolated at different seasons. there were geographical differences in bacterial incidence, e.g. staphylococcus aureus was isolated significantly more often in northern regions whereas str. dysgalactiae was more common in the south. this and other swedish investigations support the theory that a. pyogenes and strictly anaerobic bacteria are 'secondary invaders' that depend on str. dysgalactiae to cause a primary infection. it is stressed that the udders of all heifers should be examined daily so that cases of mastitis can be treated immediately.

TI  == native valve infective endocarditis in adults--analysis of 32 consecutive cases over a ten-year period from 1980 to 1989.
AB  == thirty-two patients with native valve infective endocarditis who presented over a 10-year period at our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. the presenting symptom was a persistent fever in 22 patients. in 30 patients, the new york heart association functional class was less than ii before the development of endocarditis. blood cultures were positive on all occasions in 24 out of 29 culture-positive patients. all of the viridans streptococci, accounting for 79% of the isolated pathogens, were highly susceptible to ampicillin. treatment consisted of a 6 week course of antibiotics, usually ampicillin, at a dose of 12  grams/day. in 9 cases, we had to change or stop the antibiotics because of severe side effects. the longer the period before making a diagnosis, the more severe were the symptoms of congestive heart failure and the more frequent was the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage. to initiate treatment as early as possible, in  order to minimize valve destruction and to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, serial blood cultures are recommended in patients with valvular heart disease or congenital heart disease and a persistent fever, with minimal cardiac  symptoms.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == antibody response in immunized rabbits measured with bacterial immunoglobulin-binding proteins.
AB  == protein g, an immunoglobulin (ig)-binding protein isolated from group c or g streptococci, binds to the fc portion of igg. protein l, from the anaerobic bacterium peptostreptococcus magnus, specifically binds light chains of ig. in this study, protein g and l were used to measure the production of antibodies in  immunized rabbits. two rabbits were immunized with a mixture of human urinary proteins from a patient with tubular proteinuria, and blood samples were collected regularly from the animals for 6 weeks after the immunization. the antibody levels of the blood samples against six of the proteins in the antigen mixture were then measured by elisa. microtiter plates were coated with each of the antigens, incubated with the rabbit serum samples, and the specific antibodies of the igg class measured by incubation with biotinylated protein g, and antibodies of all ig classes with biotinylated protein l. alternatively, western blotting was employed, where the antibodies which bound to each antigen after separation by sds-page and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, were detected by protein g or l. the results showed that antibody production against five of the antigens, albumin, alpha 1 gamma-acid glycoprotein, alpha 1 gamma-microglobulin, ig light chains, and retinol-binding protein, showed a similar pattern, although the magnitude of the initial igm response differed somewhat. after 6 weeks, the levels of the protein g-binding antibodies had reached a plateau, while those of protein l-binding antibodies were still increasing. the response to the sixth antigen, beta 2 microglobulin, was considerably different. a dramatic increase of anti-beta 2 gamma-microglobulin antibodies was seen during the 4th week after immunization when protein l was used.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the recolonization patterns of the subgingival microflora of adult periodontitis patients after a single session of  scaling and root planing. in each of eight patients, three clinically diseased sites were investigated microbiologically by darkfield microscopy and cultural analysis. after initial clinical and microbiological parameters were determined,  each subject received a single session of scaling and root planing but no oral hygiene instructions. clinical indices were measured and microbial parameters were reassessed 7, 21, and 60 days after treatment in a manner such that each of  the test sites was sampled only once after treatment. recolonization was evaluated by matching any single site with its own preoperative site. a significant improvement in probing depth was noted for up to 60 days after treatment, while the gingival index did not change markedly during the course of  the study. the microbial composition of treated sites 7 days after scaling and root planing, as determined by both cultural and darkfield data, was similar to that of periodontally healthy sites. differences between cultural and darkfield data became apparent at the 21 day sampling point. the darkfield data showed that the sites consisted of cocci with few spirochetes. cultural data demonstrated that the majority of the cocci were anaerobic, namely streptococcus intermedius,  veillonella parvula, and peptostreptococcus micros. at 60 days, there was no significant variation in any of the parameters from pretreatment levels. the most prevalent anaerobic rods prior to and 60 days after therapy were fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis, and b. intermedius.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

AB  == the capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. a majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine. the most active bacteria were found in the genera peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, selenomonas, centipeda, bacteroides and fusobacterium. methyl mercaptan from l-methionine was  formed by some members of the genera fusobacterium, bacteroides, porphyromonas and eubacterium. when incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loescheii, porphyromonas endodontalis and porphyromonas gingivalis. p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. no other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of l-cysteine and l-methionine. these findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce  volatile sulfur compounds.

AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the relationship between volatile fatty acids (vfas) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. vfas were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (glc). bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture  using blood agar plates. the bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the vpi manual. analysis of the direct vfa patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. the following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: streptococcus intermedius in group a, peptostreptococcus micros in group b, fusobacterium nucleatum in group c, bacteroides gingivalis in group d, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius in group e. the profile of vfas produced in the pyg culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct vfa patterns. agreement ratios between direct and pyg vfa patterns were as follows: group a, 47.1%; groups b and c, 45.0%; group d, 87.5%; and group e, 62.9%. the acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group b, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group c, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in group e. in these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and pyg fva pattern were high. in group d, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. the antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. efficiency rates of abpc, pipc, ccl,  cez, cmz, sbt/cpz, jm, cldm, mino and gm were relatively low and resistant rates  were high for the gram-negative rods.

TI  == summer mastitis in heifers: a bacteriological examination of secretions from clinical cases of summer mastitis in denmark.
AB  == a total of 166 samples of secretions collected from danish heifers suffering from clinically diagnosed summer mastitis were examined bacteriologically. one hundred and sixty three samples yielded positive findings whereas no growth was obtained  from 3 specimens. the majority of samples revealed a mixed flora in which the predominant components were actinomyces pyogenes, peptostreptococcus indolicus, a microaerophilic coccus (stuart-schwan coccus), fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteriodes melaninogenicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. pure cultures were recovered in only 7% of cases. p. indolicus was isolated from 875 of the cases, a microaerophilic coccus from 84%, a. pyogenes from 72%, fusobacterium necrophorum  from 52%, str. dysgalactiae from 37%, b. melaninogenicus from 33% and various unidentified obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods from 31%. the results confirm  the complex bacterial aetiology of summer mastitis.

TI  == the microbial flora from root canals and periodontal pockets of non-vital teeth associated with advanced periodontitis.
AB  == microflora from root canals and periodontal pockets of periodontally affected teeth were compared in order to elucidate the as yet unknown relationship between pulpal and periodontal disease. caries-free teeth affected with advanced periodontitis and diagnosed as clinically dead by electric pulp testing were selected. the root canals and periodontal pockets were sampled, and the bacterial flora examined by both culture and interference microscopy. the results indicated that the aerobe/anaerobe ratio in the periodontal pocket was 0.23, while it was 0.0022 in the root canal, the large predominance of obligate anaerobes reflecting the anaerobic environment found in the root canal. morphological classification obtained from interference microscopy showed similar proportions of morphotypes in the two sites. results of anaerobic culture demonstrated a significantly higher rate of detection of facultative streptococcus bacteria in the periodontal pocket than in the root canal. the predominant bacterial species common to both regions were streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium for obligate anaerobes. as for facultative anaerobes, actinomyces and streptococcus were detected predominantly in the periodontal pocket. the occurrence of micro-organisms common to both sites in this study suggests that the periodontal pocket may be a possible source of root canal infections.

TI  == [a microbiologic study on anaerobic bacteremia after dental extraction].
AB  == it has been known for many years that tooth extraction can cause bacterial dissemination into blood stream, that is, bacteremia. besides endocarditis--causing bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, anaerobes are involved in the post- extraction bacteremia. they are of clinical importance because they can cause abscesses in the various parenchymatous organs such as the liver, lung, and brain through anachoresis. the purpose of this study is to establish the types of species of anaerobes associated with post--extraction bacteremia, and to give the baseline to the succeeding study of sensitivity tests of various antibiotics, thus clinicians can chose the right ones. 10ml of blood was sampled pre- and post- operatively from 32 patients and incubated in anaerobic chamber. the followings are the results of this study. 1. all the preoperative blood samples showed negative culture. 2. postoperative blood samples from 8 out of 10 patients (80%) in group 1, from 1 out of 15 (73.3%) in group 2, and 2 out of 7 (28.6%) in group 3 yielded anaerobic and facultative species. 3. organisms detected were species belonging to the genera streptococcus, bacteroides, actinomyces, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, propionebacterium, fusobacterium, nonenterococcus, and corynebacterium.

TI  == an in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  == an in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. the assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga species, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus species, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to  enamel, including the fresh isolates of b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, veillonella species and s. sanguis. adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. the assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.

TI  == [significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  == in the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. as a matter of fact it has been  proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation  (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). on the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved.  in endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. the most frequently found obligate anaerobes are bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. (gram- rods) anaerobic diphtheroides (gram+ rods) peptostreptococcus sp. (gram+ cocci) and veilonella sp. (gram- cocci). actinomyces sp., lactobacillus sp., streptococcus sp., and staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  == it is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans. a quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 x 10(6) cfu/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). the strain of f. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). p. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. it is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus  pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.

AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

TI  == in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of a new penem fce 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. fce 22101 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. ducreyi, neisseria gonorrhoeae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis and group b streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with mic90 of greater than 32 mg/l. streptococcus faecalis displayed mic90 of 16 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium spp., peptococcus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated mics. fce 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of crevicular epithelial cells.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the composition of the predominant cultivable microbiota associated with gingival crevicular epithelial  cells with that of the unattached microbiota recovered from the same site. samples were taken from 2 diseased sites from 8 periodontal patients, by scraping the epithelial lining of the pocket with a curette. the epithelial cells were separated from the unattached subgingival bacteria by centrifugation in a reduced 50% percoll density gradient. epithelial cells formed a band at the top of the gradient and were removed separately from the unattached bacteria located at the  base. each layer was dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood and 50 isolates were characterized from each sample. the microorganisms associated with the epithelial layer harbored 5- to 20-fold higher mean percentages of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius and peptostreptococcus micros. the layer of unattached organisms exhibited 4- to 10-fold higher mean percentages of streptococcus uberis, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens and veillonella parvula.

TI  == bacterial flora in chronic tonsillitis.
AB  == a study of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic tonsillitis revealed  a total of 59 isolates. aerobic flora from the surface swab was found in 80%, from the core of the tonsil in 92% and from both the surface and the core in 68%  of the cases. there were 30 aerobic isolates from the surface and 29 isolates from the core. mixed flora were present from the surface and the core in 10 and 7 cases, respectively. pathogens were seen in 36% of the cases from the surface and in 40% from the core. there was no significant difference in the nature of aerobic flora from the two sites. anaerobic flora were cultured from the core only and were seen in 20% of cases. there were a total of 7 isolates. in 16% cases it was associated with aerobic flora. the common aerobes were beta hemolytic streptococcus (16%) and staphylococcus coagulase positive (12%) and common anaerobes were peptostreptococcus (16%) and veillonella parvula (4%). there was no consistent pattern of combination of aerobes and anaerobes in chronic tonsillitis.

TI  == an in vitro method to study the adherence of oral bacteria to hela cells.
AB  == exfoliated buccal epithelial cells have been widely used in microbial adherence studies, but present a number of problems due to their variable nature and to contamination with indigenous bacteria. an adherence assay was developed using hela cell monolayers which were washed with buffer, or treated with saliva or serum to mimic buccal or crevicular epithelial cells, respectively. a total of eighteen strains of oral bacteria tested showed a low affinity for untreated hela cells, but most strains adhered in high numbers to saliva treated hela cells. a few strains, usually present in the gingival crevice, demonstrated a high affinity for serum treated hela cells. thus, salivary and crevicular fluid components appear to be specifically implicated in the selective adherence and colonization of bacteria on oral surfaces.

TI  == fermentation of peptides and amino acids by a monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus.
AB  == a monensin-sensitive ruminal peptostreptococcus was able to grow rapidly (growth  rate of 0.5/h) on an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, but less than 23% of the amino acid nitrogen was ever utilized. when an acid hydrolysate was substituted for the enzymatic digest, more than 31% of the nitrogen was converted to ammonia  and cell protein. coculture experiments and synergisms with peptide-degrading strains of bacteroides ruminicola and streptococcus bovis indicated that the peptostreptococcus was unable to transport certain peptides or hydrolyze them extracellularly. leucine, serine, phenylalanine, threonine, and glutamine were deaminated at rates of 349, 258, 102, 95, and 91 nmol/mg of protein per min, respectively. deamination rates for some other amino acids were increased when the amino acids were provided as pairs of oxidized and reduced amino acids (stickland reactions), but these rates were still less than 80 nmol/mg of protein per min. in continuous culture (dilution rate of 0.1/h), bacterial dry matter and ammonia production decreased dramatically at a ph of less than 6.0. when dilution rates were increased from 0.08 to 0.32/h (ph 7.0), ammonia production increased while production of bacterial dry matter and protein decreased. these rather peculiar kinetics resulted in a slightly negative estimate of maintenance energy  and could not be explained by a change in fermentation products. approximately 80% of the cell dry matter was protein. when corrections were made for cell composition, the yield of atp was higher than the theoretical maximum value. it is possible that mechanisms other than substrate-level phosphorylation contributed to the energetics of growth.

TI  == preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == the preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, rapid ana and a prototype system from api. both systems identified peptostreptococcus anaerobius, ps. asaccharolyticus, ps. indolicus, ps. magnus and ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of ps. magnus misidentified as ps. micros by the rapid ana system. the indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as ps. prevotii and ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype api system, but the results with rapid ana were often misleading. eight strains of hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. we conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.

TI  == cecal and fecal bacterial flora of the mongolian gerbil and the chinchilla.
AB  == the mongolian gerbil is being increasingly used as a laboratory animal and as a pet. both chinchillas and gerbils are used as animal models for otitis media and  other otic research. previously, only incomplete information was available regarding the indigenous bacterial flora of the lower intestinal tracts of these  coprophagic animals. using the strict anaerobic methodology of the virginia polytechnic institute anaerobe laboratory, we studied the predominant bacterial flora of the cecum and fecal pellets of the gerbil and the chinchilla and the bacterial flora of digesta pellets in the proximal colon. we found species of the following anaerobic genera in high dilutions of gerbil fecal pellets: bifidobacterium, clostridium, propionibacterium, lactobacillus, and bacteroides.  only lactobacilli were found in high dilutions of digesta from the upper colon, although the cecum yielded peptostreptococcus, bifidobacterium, clostridium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, and bacteroides species from high dilutions of  cecal contents. the facultatively anaerobic and aerobic flora isolated consisted  of species of bacillus, streptococcus, staphylococcus, acinetobacter, alcaligenes, escherichia, pasteurella, and pseudomonas plus several unidentifiable organisms. species of bifidobacterium, bacteroides, eubacterium, and anaerobic lactobacillus were isolated from chinchillas.

TI  == semiquantitative culture results and pathogenic significance of obligate anaerobes in peritonsillar abscesses.
AB  == we studied the bacteria in consecutive peritonsillar abscesses using semiquantitation of the primary culture findings and correlated the results to clinical parameters. puncture-aspirated pus from 42 abscesses yielded 133 isolates. group a streptococci were isolated 10 times and, unlike other bacteria, were isolated 4 times in pure culture; other beta-hemolytic streptococci were found in 8 abscesses, and anaerobes were found in 28. the infections were polymicrobial, with two to seven bacteria in 83%. anaerobes were more abundant than nonanaerobes; members of the genera streptococcus, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and fusobacterium were the most important quantitatively, considering both frequency and abundance. in patients with ongoing antibiotic treatment, nonanaerobes (but not anaerobes) were less abundant than in untreated  patients. the abundance of obligate anaerobes (specifically cocci and gram-positive rods) correlated to the severity of illness as defined by fever and short duration before hospitalization. with other groups of bacteria, no such correlation was found. the correlation was not explained by a difference between  the antibiotic-treated and the untreated patients. the results indicate the value of the semiquantitation of culture data and the frequency and pathogenic significance of obligate anaerobes in peritonsillar abscesses.

TI  == effect of high-fiber and high-oil diets on the fecal flora of swine.
AB  == six pairs of pigs were fed a basal diet, a high-fiber diet, and a diet high in corn oil in different sequences to minimize the carry-over effect of diet. after  2 months on each diet, a fecal specimen from each pig was cultured on nonselective medium in roll tubes. fifty colonies were randomly selected from each fecal sample, and isolates were characterized to identify a representative cross section of the fecal flora. the bacterial composition of the fecal flora differed between basal and high-fiber diets (p = 0.002) and between high-fiber and high-oil diets (p = 0.015). however, the floras were not significantly different between the basal and the high-oil diets (p = 0.135), nor were the floras of the 12 individual pigs (each on all three diets) statistically different (p = 0.103). only 14 of the 160 observed taxa have been detected in the human fecal flora, and only 159 of 1,871 total isolates (8.5%) were members of described species. the most common isolate was a streptococcus species similar to that reported by robinson et al. (i. m. robinson, s. c. whipp, j. a. bucklin, and m. j. allison, appl. environ. microbiol. 48:964-969, 1984), which was found in 34 of 36 samples and which represented 27.5% of all isolates. lactobacillus, fusobacterium, eubacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococcus species were the  next most common bacteria. escherichia coli represented 1.7% of all fecal isolates, which is somewhat higher than the 0.1 to 0.6% observed in human feces cultured similarly with prereduced anaerobically sterilized media.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

AB  == in vitro susceptibilities of 369 to 966 bacterial isolates from periodontal lesions to eight antibiotics were determined by agar dilution technique as a means of determining which antimicrobial agents were inhibitory for bacteria frequently associated with destructive periodontal diseases. although most bacteria were relatively susceptible to the penicillins, greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with either penicillin or ampicillin with the exception of selenomonas sputigena and peptostreptococcus. antibacterial activities obtained with minocycline were significantly higher than with tetracycline for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus but comparable for most other taxa. clindamycin and metronidazole both demonstrated excellent activity against the anaerobic gram-negative rods but were less effective against some of the capnophilic and facultative organisms. eikenella corrodens was exceptionally resistant to both of these drugs; and a. actinomycetemcomitans was generally resistant to clindamycin but relatively susceptible to metronidazole. erythromycin was considerably less active than the  other antibiotics against the majority of the periodontal bacteria. no single antibiotic, at concentrations equivalent to those achieved in body fluids, was uniformly effective in inhibiting all bacteria currently implicated or suspected  as etiologic agents of periodontal diseases.

TI  == predominant obligate anaerobes in human carious dentin.
AB  == with the adoption of an anaerobic glove box system, we isolated and identified the predominant micro-organisms in lesions of carious dentin from four permanent  third molars. the overwhelming majority of the micro-organisms isolated from both shallow and deep layers of carious dentin were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that conditions in the dentin were strictly anaerobic. the predominant obligate anaerobes were gram-positive rods which were identified as members of the following genera: propionibacterium, eubacterium, arachnia, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and actinomyces. clostridia, gram-negative rods (bacteroides and fusobacterium) and gram-positive cocci (peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and streptococcus) were also isolated, although they constituted a minor part of the  flora.

TI  == survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  == periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. one effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. the subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. when active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. the subjects were treated by modified widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. on completion of  therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. a site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. the subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. the annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. the hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2a) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2b) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. group 2a and  2b individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment  response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides intermedius and capnocytophaga sputigena. the predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea and b. intermedius than the poor responding group. the latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of f. nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius.

TI  == comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  == adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk0787/mk0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. major pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus species. satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. no major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. the results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess: bacteriological evaluation.
AB  == the pus from a series of 41 peritonsillar abscesses was examined bacteriologically. in the majority of the abscesses a mixed bacterial flora was found. the specimens yielded 0-7 different bacterial species per abscess (mean 3.0). one species alone was isolated only in five cases (12.5%). both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were isolated from the specimens of 25 patients (61%), only  anaerobes from two specimens (4.9%), and only facultative bacteria from 12 specimens (29%). beta haemolytic streptococci were cultured in 43.9% of the cases, but streptococcus pyogenes group a in only 10 cases (24.4%). thus, the pus of the peritonsillar abscess seems to be caused by a mixed bacterial infection, where anaerobic bacteria play a significant role. indications of tonsillectomy in cases with peritonsillar abscess are discussed.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

AB  == the pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (agpc) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. the relationships among seven agpc strains, eight aerobes, and two bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. a total of 70 different combinations were tested. as judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or agpc were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35  combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. the agpc most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were peptococcus magnus, streptococcus constellatus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the agpc.

AB  == a fundamental and clinical study of ceftizoxime (czx), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, has brought about the following results. 1. the antibacterial activity of czx against bacteriodes fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron was superior to that of cez, but inferior to that of cfx. czx was the most active of the 3 drugs against b. distasonis, and was as active as cfx against b. vulgatus. the mics of czx against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus and anaerobic streptococcus were 1.56 microgram/ml or lower. cez was more active than czx against these anaerobic cocci. 2. the concentrations of czx in female genital organs and retroperitoneal dead space exudate after drip infusion of 1 g were high enough to fulfill the mics of many bacterial isolates. 3. czx administered intravenously to 9 patients in daily doses of 1 approximately 8 g for 4 approximately 11 days was  100% effective. pathogenic bacteria in 6 of the patients were eradicated in 4 and partially eradicated in 1. the other patient had no bacteriological examination after therapy. 4. no adverse reaction was observed. from above results it is concluded that czx must be one of the most effective antibiotics for the treatment of gynecological infections.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

TI  == bacterial interference between clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. it is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by c. difficile. the inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against c. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of c. difficile, with lactobacillus organisms and group d enterococci displaying  the most antagonistic activity. c. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. all eight strains of c. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera bacteroides, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus.

AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

TI  == puerperal sepsis in port moresby, papua new guinea.
AB  == because puerperal sepsis is the second most common cause of maternal death in papua new guinea some aspects of its aetiology and prevention have been investigated. 91% of 125 women with puerperal fever were found to have post-partum uterine infection. the anaerobes bacteroides and peptostreptococcus singly or together, were the commonest causes, while streptococcus pyogenes was the predominant aerobic species. antibiotic sensitivity patterns were established, and chloramphenicol was found to be the most active agent against anaerobic and most aerobic strains. endocervical cultures obtained from 103 ante-partum and 50 afebrile post-partum women demonstrated all the species associated with post-partum genital infection in this study. an analysis of the records of all patients was made to determine the redisposing factors associated  with puerperal fever; only operative delivery was found to be significant, especially when it followed prolonged labour. metronidazole given to 72 women before induction of labour was associated with puerperal fever in 4%, compared with 21% in matched controls.

AB  == this study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. bacterial growth occurred  in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. there were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). the predominant isolates were: e. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); group d streptococcus (12 specimens); and p. aeruginosa (9 specimens). there were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). the predominant isolates were: 157 bacteroides spp. (including 92 b. fragilis group and 26 b. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 peptococcus sp.; 29 peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 fusobactenium sp.; and 16 clostridium sp. b. fragilis and peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. these included all isolates of b. fragilis and six of the 23 bacteroides sp. forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. the predominant organisms were: b. fragilis (8 specimens); e. coli (6 specimens); peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.

AB  == rabbit antiserum against live or heat-killed bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343 bacteria was titrated against hot phenol water-extracted polysaccharide antigens  from five different species of the 'b. fragilis group' of bacteria using an enzyme immunoassay and shown to be specific for the b. fragilis nctc 9343 polysaccharide. when the antiserum was used in indirect immunofluorescence, 97.1% of 244 b. fragilis strains were correctly identified. only 8 of the other 312 bacteroides strains were stained by the anti-b fragilis serum. the 'cross-reactive' bacteriodes strains all belonged to the "b. fragilis group" of bacteria (i.e., b; distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, and  b. vulgatus). none of the 425 aerobic enteric bacteria representing salmonella, e. coli, proteus, yersinia, shigella, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and  pseudomonas were positive using the anti-b. fragilis serum. likewise, all the 59  gram-positive strains representing streptococcus, bacillus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, propionibacterium, lactobacillus, eubacterium, and clostridium did not stain. our data shows in accordance with other findings [11], that b. fragilis strains possess a species-specific cell envelope antigen(s) which promises to be important for production of antisera, making a rapid identification of the species possible.

TI  == comparative susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, ornidazole,  and sc-28538.
AB  == the susceptibilities of 284 anaerobic bacteria, including 55 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, were determined by an agar dilution technique to metronidazole and two newer nitroimidazoles, ornidazole and sc-28538. all three agents showed marked in vitro activity against virtually all anaerobic bacteria tested. at concentrations </=1 mug/ml, sc-28538 was significantly more active than either metronidazole or ornidazole. at concentrations of >1 mug/ml, the activities of all three agents were comparable. propionibacterium and actinomyces showed significant resistance to all three agents. anaerobic and microaerophilic  members of the genus streptococcus were also often resistant, in contrast to peptococcus and peptostreptococcus strains. in addition, the bactericidal activities of ornidazole and sc-28538 were determined against 27 strains of the b. fragilis group by a broth dilution technique. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of each agent were very close. at concentrations of </=0.5 mug/ml, sc-28538 showed greater bactericidal activity; at concentrations of >/=2 mug/ml, the activies of both agents were similar.

TI  == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and  veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.

TI  == clindamycin-induced enterocolitis in hamsters.
AB  == a lethal enterocolitis was induced in hamsters by oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin in amounts comparable to those used in treatment of humans. the intestinal lesions were characterized histologically as an acute inflammatory reaction with pseudomembrane formation and resembled the lesions seen in humans with antibiotic-induced colitis. results of quantitative stool cultures showed the numbers of peptostreptococcus and corynebacterium decreased in animals with colitis after challenge with 100 mg of clindamycin/kg, while numbers of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clindamycin-resistant clostridium sordellii and clostridium difficile increased. bacteria were not seen within the intestinal lesions. viruses were not isolated from hamsters with colitis. although the pathogenesis of this syndrome is not completely established, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease is caused by clostridial toxins and that the production of these toxins by organisms within the intestines is enhanced by the effects of clindamycin upon the bowel flora.

AB  == forty-two of 929 (4.5 per cent) newborn infants prospectively studied following continuous, direct fetal heart rate monitoring during labor developed a scalp abscess at the site of electrode application during the neonatal period. factors  associated with infection with the use of a multivariate analysis were duration of monitoring (p less than 0.01) and high-risk indications for monitoring (p less than 0.01). of the 42 infected neonates, 33 had complete bacteriologic studies. microorganisms were isolated from all the infection tended to be polymicrobial, most commonly containing both aerobes and anaerobes. staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and peptococcus were the predominant isolates. these data indicate that scalp abscess complicating intrapartum fetal monitoring  may be nosocomial importance, and infants monitored should be closely observed in order to prevent more serious infectious complications.

AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.

TI  == the elimination of urease activity in streptococcus faecium as evidence for plasmid-coded urease.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus faecium from the sheep rumen showed spontaneous loss of urease activity when subcultured at the normal rumen temperature of 38 degrees c, although in mixed cultures in vivo or in vitro loss of urease was not apparent. the rate of loss of urease in pure cultures was increased at incubation temperatures above 38 degrees c, but loss was never complete. however, at temperatures below 38 degrees c loss was greater, and at 22 or 18 degrees c the urease was completely eliminated. incubation with sodium dodecyl sulphate (0-002%) or ethidium bromide (2-5 x 10(-5)m) caused complete loss of urease activity. the urease activity was also eliminated when the streptococcus was grown aerobically, and this loss of activity was irreversible. it is suggested that the urease activity is controlled by a plasmid gene and that aeration, low growth temperature and chemical agents 'cure' the streptococcus of the plasmid. attempts to demonstrate the presence of covalently closed circular extrachromosomal dna by caesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation were unsuccessful.

TI  == bacteremia after tooth extractions studied with the aid of prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture media.
AB  == both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in  otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and  facultative species. colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to  over 100 colonies per ml of blood. organisms detected were species belonging to the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, leptotrichia, propionibacterium, peptococcus, veillonella, plus streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling s. mutans. the data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.

TI  == stomach fermentation in east african colobus monkeys in their natural state.
AB  == the microbial fermentation in the stomachs of two monkeys, colobus polykomos, collected in kenya, was studied. the gas accumulated within the stomach contained h(2) but no ch(4). volatile fatty acid concentrations were high, but accumulated  acid prevented determination of the fermentation rate in untreated, incubated stomach contents. upon addition of bicarbonate, a very rapid rate could be demonstrated. some d- and l-lactate were in the stomach contents. starchy seeds or fruits rather than leaves appeared to have been consumed. microscopically, the most prominent microorganisms seen were large, very refringent cocci, possibly sarcina ventriculi, and various smaller cocci and rods. the 28 cultured strains of bacteria included 14 staphylococcus, 2 streptococcus, 10 propionibacterium, and 2 peptostreptococcus. the culture count constituted 10 to 20% of the direct count. no protozoa or cellulolytic bacteria were found.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == comparison of methods for isolation of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens.
AB  == five different anaerobic culture methods and several different media were compared for their ability to recover anaerobes from clinical specimens. specimens were obtained from patients with documented infections, avoiding contamination with normal flora, and immediately placed in an anaerobic transporter. each specimen was cultured by all methods and on all the various media. the comparative data indicate that anaerobic jars (gaspak and evacuation-replacement types) are just as effective in the recovery of clinically significant anaerobes as the more complex roll-tube and chamber methods employing prereduced media. liquid media were disappointing as a "back-up" system but chopped-meat glucose was superior to two thioglycolate formulations. growth of all anaerobes was poorer on selective media, but these media were very helpful in the workup of specimens containing mixed growth of anaerobic and facultative organisms. a variety of different anaerobes was isolated, but no very fastidious  or extremely oxygen-sensitive organisms were recovered. this suggests that such organisms may not play a significant role in causing clinical infections.

TI  == ruminal bacterial degradation of benzo(b)-thien-4-yl methylcarbamate (mobam) and  effect of mobam on ruminal bacteria.
AB  == mixtures of ruminal bacteria degraded benzo(b)thien-4-yl methylcarbamate (mobam)  to 4-hydroxybenzothiophene, co(2), and polar product(s). the metabolite, 4-hydroxybenzothiophene, was identified (after acetylation) by comparative infrared and mass spectrometry with an authentic sample. carbon dioxide and polar product(s) were produced by degradation of the methylcarbamate moiety. ten previously characterized strains of ruminal bacteria with diverse physiological capabilities did not degrade mobam. however, three tributyrin-hydrolyzing strains were isolated that did degrade mobam. mobam inhibited growth of two of ten strains isolated on mobam-free glycerol-tributyrin enrichment medium. one of these strains was also sensitive to 2-carbomethoxy-propene-2yl dimethyl phosphate (phosdrin). mobam prevented some ruminal bacteria from producing zones of hydrolysis in tributyrin emulsion media and inhibited some ruminal bacteria from  degrading 1-naphthyl acetate and fluorescein-3',6'-diacetate.

AB  == joyner, a. e., jr. (university of california, davis), and r. l. baldwin. enzymatic studies of pure cultures of rumen microorganisms. j. bacteriol. 92:1321-1330. 1966.-the activities of enzymes representing the major pathways of  carbohydrate metabolism and anaerobic electron transport in cell-free extracts of whole rumen contents have been reported. the effects of diet upon the activities  of several enzymes suggested that enzymatic measurements might prove useful for the study of rumen metabolism. in the present study, the distribution and characteristics of aldolase, succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and other enzymes were measured in cell-free extracts of pure cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens, r.  albus, bacteroides succinogenes, b. ruminicola, b. amylophilus, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, peptostreptococcus elsdenii, streptococcus bovis, and selenomonas ruminantium. some enzymes were widely distributed (aldolase, glutamate dehydrogenase), whereas others were observed in one or two species (lactyl-coenzyme a dehydrase). the cofactor requirements and kinetic characteristics of enzymes varied considerably with species. enzymes that vary with species might be employed as indices for estimating the activities of various groups of microorganisms in whole rumen contents.
