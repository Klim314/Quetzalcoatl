TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.
