TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with lactobacillus gg: a randomised clinical  trial.
AB  == background & aims: intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (cf). administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. we investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with cf and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. we also investigated the microflora structure before and after lactobacillus gg (lgg) administration in children with cf with and without antibiotic treatment. methods: the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (clp) and rectal nitric oxide (rno) production in children with cf as compared with healthy controls. we  then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with lgg. results: twenty-two children with cf children were enrolled in the study (median  age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). fecal clp and rno levels were higher in children with cf than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/l no2 (-), respectively; p<0.01). compared with healthy controls, children with cf had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. the levels of eubacterium rectale, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with cf. a similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with cf who were taking antibiotics. lgg administration reduced fecal clp and partially restored intestinal microbiota. there was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. conclusions: cf causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cf. administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct 01961661.

TI  == influence of red wine polyphenols and ethanol on the gut microbiota ecology and biochemical biomarkers.
AB  == background: few studies have investigated the effect of dietary polyphenols on the complex human gut microbiota, and they focused mainly on single polyphenol molecules and select bacterial populations. objective: the objective was to evaluate the effect of a moderate intake of red wine polyphenols on select gut microbial groups implicated in host health benefits. design: ten healthy male volunteers underwent a randomized, crossover, controlled intervention study. after a washout period, all of the subjects received red wine, the equivalent amount of de-alcoholized red wine, or gin for 20 d each. total fecal dna was submitted to polymerase chain reaction(pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time quantitative pcr to monitor and quantify changes in fecal microbiota. several biochemical markers were measured. results: the dominant bacterial composition did not remain constant over the different intake  periods. compared with baseline, the daily consumption of red wine polyphenol for 4 wk significantly increased the number of enterococcus, prevotella, bacteroides, bifidobacterium, bacteroides uniformis, eggerthella lenta, and blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale groups (p < 0.05). in parallel, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and triglyceride, total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, and c-reactive protein concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05). moreover, changes in cholesterol and c-reactive protein concentrations were linked to changes in the bifidobacteria number. conclusion: this study showed that red wine consumption can significantly modulate the growth of select gut microbiota in humans, which suggests possible prebiotic benefits associated with  the inclusion of red wine polyphenols in the diet. this trial was registered at controlled-trials.com as isrctn88720134.
