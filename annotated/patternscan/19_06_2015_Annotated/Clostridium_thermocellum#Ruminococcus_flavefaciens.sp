TI  == expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of ctta, a putative cellulose-binding protein from ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == a number of anaerobic microorganisms produce multi-modular, multi-enzyme complexes termed cellulosomes. these extracellular macromolecular nanomachines are designed for the efficient degradation of plant cell-wall carbohydrates to smaller sugars that are subsequently used as a source of carbon and energy. cellulolytic strains from the rumens of mammals, such as ruminococcus flavefaciens, have been shown to have one of the most complex cellulosomal systems known. cellulosome assembly requires the binding of dockerin modules located in cellulosomal enzymes to cohesin modules located in a macromolecular scaffolding protein. over 220 genes encoding dockerin-containing proteins have been identified in the r. flavefaciens genome. the dockerin-containing enzymes can be incorporated into the primary scaffoldin (scaa), which in turn can bind to adaptor scaffoldins (scab or scac) and subsequently to anchoring scaffoldin (scae), thereby attaching the whole complex to the cell surface. however, unlike  other cellulosomes such as that from clostridium thermocellum, the ruminococcus species lack a specific carbohydrate-binding module (cbm) on scaa which recruits  the entire complex onto the surface of the substrate. instead, a cellulose-binding protein, ctta, comprising two putative tandem novel carbohydrate-binding modules and a c-terminal x-dockerin module, which can bind to the cohesin of scae, may mediate the attachment of bacterial cells to cellulose. here, the expression, purification and crystallization of the carbohydrate-binding modular part of the ctta from r. flavefaciens are described. x-ray data have been collected to resolutions of 3.23 and to 1.61 a in space groups p3121 or p3221 and p21, respectively. the structure was phased using bound iodide from the crystallization buffer by sad experiments.

TI  == insights into a type iii cohesin-dockerin recognition interface from the cellulose-degrading bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == cellulosomes are large multicomponent cellulose-degrading assemblies found on the surfaces of cellulolytic microorganisms. often containing hundreds of components, the self-assembly of cellulosomes is mediated by the ultra-high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction, which allows them to adopt the complex architectures necessary for degrading recalcitrant cellulose. better understanding of how the cellulosome assembles and functions and what kinds of structures it adopts will further effort to develop industrial applications of cellulosome components, including their use in bioenergy production. ruminococcus flavefaciens is a well-studied anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria found in the intestinal tracts of ruminants and other herbivores. key to cellulosomal self-assembly in this bacterium is the dockerin scaadoc, found on the non-catalytic structural subunit scaffoldin scaa, which is responsible for assembling arrays of cellulose-degrading enzymes. this work expands on previous efforts by conducting a series of binding studies on scaadoc constructs that contain mutations in their cohesin recognition interface, in order to identify which residues play important roles in binding. molecular dynamics simulations were employed to gain insight into the structural basis for our findings. a specific residue pair in the first helix of scaadoc, as well as a glutamate near  the c-terminus, was identified to be essential for cohesin binding. by advancing  our understanding of the cohesin binding of scaadoc, this study serves as a foundation for future work to more fully understand the structural basis of cellulosome assembly in r. flavefaciens.

TI  == intramolecular clasp of the cellulosomal ruminococcus flavefaciens scaa dockerin  module confers structural stability.
AB  == the cellulosome is a large extracellular multi-enzyme complex that facilitates the efficient hydrolysis and degradation of crystalline cellulosic substrates. during the course of our studies on the cellulosome of the rumen bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens, we focused on the critical scaa dockerin (scaadoc), the unique dockerin that incorporates the primary enzyme-integrating scaa scaffoldin into the cohesin-bearing scab adaptor scaffoldin. in the absence of a  high-resolution structure of the scaadoc module, we generated a computational model, and, upon its analysis, we were surprised to discover a putative stacking  interaction between an n-terminal trp and a c-terminal pro, which we termed intramolecular clasp. in order to verify the existence of such an interaction, these residues were mutated to alanine. circular dichroism spectroscopy, intrinsic tryptophan and ans fluorescence, and nmr spectroscopy indicated that mutation of these residues has a destabilizing effect on the functional integrity of the ca(2+)-bound form of scaadoc. analysis of recently determined dockerin structures from other species revealed the presence of other well-defined intramolecular clasps, which consist of different types of interactions between selected residues at the dockerin termini. we propose that this thematic interaction may represent a major distinctive structural feature of the dockerin  module.

TI  == surface display of a functional minicellulosome by intracellular complementation  using a synthetic yeast consortium and its application to cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  == in this paper, we report the surface assembly of a functional minicellulosome by  using a synthetic yeast consortium. the basic design of the consortium consisted  of four different engineered yeast strains capable of either displaying a trifunctional scaffoldin, scaf-ctf (sc), carrying three divergent cohesin domains from clostridium thermocellum (t), clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and ruminococcus flavefaciens (f), or secreting one of the three corresponding dockerin-tagged cellulases (endoglucanase [at], exoglucanase [ec/cb], or beta-glucosidase [bf]). the secreted cellulases were docked onto the displayed scaf-ctf in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the three cohesin-dockerin pairs employed, resulting in the assembly of a functional  minicellulosome on the yeast surface. by exploiting the modular nature of each population to provide a unique building block for the minicellulosome structure,  the overall cellulosome assembly, cellulose hydrolysis, and ethanol production were easily fine-tuned by adjusting the ratio of different populations in the consortium. the optimized consortium consisted of a sc:at:cb:bf ratio of 7:2:4:2  and produced almost twice the level of ethanol (1.87 g/liter) as a consortium with an equal ratio of the different populations. the final ethanol yield of 0.475 g of ethanol/g of cellulose consumed also corresponded to 93% of the theoretical value. this result confirms the use of a synthetic biology approach for the synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol by  using a yeast consortium displaying a functional minicellulosome.

TI  == functional assembly of minicellulosomes on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  == we demonstrated the functional display of a miniscaffoldin on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface consisting of three divergent cohesin domains from clostridium thermocellum (t), clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and ruminococcus flavefaciens (f). incubation with escherichia coli lysates containing an endoglucanase (cela) fused with a dockerin domain from c. thermocellum (at), an exoglucanase (cele) from c. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from the  same species (ec), and an endoglucanase (celg) from c. cellulolyticum fused with  a dockerin domain from r. flavefaciens (gf) resulted in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast cell surface. the displayed minicellulosome retained the synergistic effect for cellulose hydrolysis. when a  beta-glucosidase (bgla) from c. thermocellum tagged with the dockerin from r. flavefaciens was used in place of gf, cells displaying the new minicellulosome exhibited significantly enhanced glucose liberation and produced ethanol directly from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. the final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/liter was 2.6-fold higher than that obtained by using the same amounts of added purified cellulases. the overall yield was 0.49 g of ethanol produced per g of carbohydrate consumed, which corresponds to 95% of the theoretical value. this result confirms that simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol can be efficiently accomplished with a yeast strain displaying a functional minicellulosome containing all three required cellulolytic enzymes.

TI  == cohesin diversity revealed by the crystal structure of the anchoring cohesin from ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == the cellulosome is an intriguing multienzyme complex found in cellulolytic bacteria that plays a key role in the degradation of plant cell-wall polysaccharides. in ruminococcus flavefaciens, a predominant fiber-degrading bacterium found in ruminants, the cellulosome is anchored to the bacterial cell wall through a relatively short scae scaffoldin. determination of the crystal structure of the lone type-iii scae cohesin from r. flavefaciens (rf-cohe) was initiated as a part of a structural effort to define cellulosome assembly. the structure was determined at 1.95 a resolution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. this is the first detailed description of a crystal structure for a  type-iii cohesin, and its features were compared with those of the known type-i and type-ii cohesin structures. the rf-cohe module folds into a nine-stranded beta-sandwich with jellyroll topology, typically observed for cohesins, and includes two beta-flaps in the midst of beta-strands 4 and 8, similar to the type-ii cohesin structures. however, the presence in rf-cohe of an additional 13-residue alpha-helix located between beta-strands 8 and 9 represents a dramatic divergence from other known cohesin structures. the prominent alpha-helix is enveloped by an extensive n-terminal loop, not observed in any other known cohesin, which embraces the helix presumably enhancing its stability. a planar surface at the upper portion of the front face of the molecule, bordered by beta-flap 8, exhibits plausible dimensions and exposed amino acid residues to accommodate the dockerin-binding site.

TI  == unravelling carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  == carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria has been investigated essentially in clostridium thermocellum, clostridium cellulolyticum, fibrobacter  succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and ruminococcus albus. while cellulose  depolymerization into soluble sugars by various cellulases is undoubtedly the first step in bacterial metabolisation of cellulose, it is not the only one to consider. among anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, c. cellulolyticum has been investigated metabolically the most in the past few years. summarizing metabolic  flux analyses in continuous culture using either cellobiose (a soluble cellodextrin resulting from cellulose hydrolysis) or cellulose (an insoluble biopolymer), this review aims to stress the importance of the insoluble nature of a carbon source on bacterial metabolism. furthermore, some general and specific traits of anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria trends, namely, the importance and benefits of (i) cellodextrins with degree of polymerization higher than 2, (ii) intracellular phosphorolytic cleavage, (iii) glycogen cycling on cell bioenergetics, and (iv) carbon overflows in regulation of carbon metabolism, as well as detrimental effects of (i) soluble sugars and (ii) acidic environment on  bacterial growth. future directions for improving bacterial cellulose degradation are discussed.

TI  == phylogenetic reconstruction of gram-positive organisms based on comparative sequence analysis of molecular chaperones from the ruminal microorganism ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1.
AB  == primers designed on the basis of nucleotide sequences conserved in dnak and groel from gram-positive organisms were used to pcr amplify internal regions of the cognate genes from the anaerobic ruminal cellulolytic bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1. genome walking was then utilized to elucidate the remainder of the sequences in addition to upstream and downstream regions. the full sequence of the gene encoding the groes protein (groes) was found directly upstream from groel. the deduced amino acid sequence of the groel gene showed the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of the clostridium thermocellum groel protein (72% amino acid identity). similarly, translation of the groes nucleotide sequence showed highest homology to the c. thermocellum groes protein (61% amino  acid identity). analysis of the upstream region of this chaperonin operon revealed a circe regulatory element 45 bp upstream from the putative start of the groes orf. the deduced amino acid sequence of the putative dnak gene showed the highest homology with the amino acid sequence of the clostridium acetobutylicum dnak protein (68% amino acid identity). phylogenetic analyses based on the translated sequences reiterate this relationship between r. flavefaciens and the  clostridia. however, when the nucleotide sequences of gram-positive organisms are analyzed, a different topology occurs of the relationship between high- and low-g+c gram-positive organisms to the 16s rrna interpretation.

TI  == the effect of yellow affinity substance on cellulases of ruminococcus flavefaciens.
AB  == cellulolytic cultures of ruminococcus flavefaciens produced a yellow affinity substance (yas) with a strong affinity to microcrystalline cellulose (mc). yas was bound to mc in the range of ph from 5 to 8 and at temperatures from 10 degrees c to 60 degrees c. the positive effect of yas on adsorption of ruminococcal cellulases was demonstrated by comparing the adsorption behaviour of endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases onto mc and yas-treated mc. hplc chromatography proved the presence of two yellow compounds with affinity to cellulose as well as to ruminococcal cellulases. both yas compounds were sensitive to oxidation. the observed yas properties showed a close relation to ys of clostridium thermocellum.

TI  == three neocallimastix patriciarum esterases associated with the degradation of complex polysaccharides are members of a new family of hydrolases.
AB  == acetylesterase and cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activities were demonstrated in culture supernatant of the anaerobic ruminal fungus neocallimastix patriciarum. a cdna expression library from n. patriciarum was screened for esterases using beta-naphthyl acetate and a model cinnamoyl ester compound. cdna clones representing four different esterase genes (bnaa-d) were isolated. none of the enzymes had cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity, but two of the enzymes (bnaa and  bnac) had acetylxylan esterase activity, bnaa, bnab and bnac encode proteins with several distinct domains. carboxy-terminal repeats in bnaa and bnac are homologous to protein-docking domains in other enzymes from neocallimastix species and another anaerobic fungus, a piromyces sp. the catalytic domains of bnab and bnac are members of a recently described family of ser/his active site hydrolases [upton, c. & buckley, j.t. (1995). trends biochem sci 20, 178-179]. bnab exhibits 40% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the cele cellulase from clostridium thermocellum and bnac exhibits 52% amino acid identity to a domain of unknown function in the xynb xylanase from ruminococcus flavefaciens. bnaa, whilst exhibiting less than 10% overall amino acid identity to bnab or bnac, or to any other known protein, appears to be a member of the same family of hydrolases, having the three universally conserved amino acid sequence motifs. several other previously described esterases are also shown to be members of this family, including a rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase from aspergillus aculeatus. however, none of the other previously described enzymes with acetylxylan esterase activity are members of this family of hydrolases.

TI  == features of the cellodextrinase gene from fibrobacter succinogenes s85.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb dna fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (ceda) from the ruminal anaerobe fibrobacter succinogenes s85 was determined. activity was expressed from this fragment when it was cloned in both  orientations in pbluescript ks+ and sk-, indicating a functional f. succinogenes  promoter in escherichia coli. promoter sequences (ttgaaca and aataa) were identified upstream of the atg initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site. the ceda open reading frame of 1071 base pairs encoded a protein of 357 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41.9 kda, similar to  the 40-kda size of the native protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography. ceda is proposed to belong to family 5 (family a) of the glycosyl hydrolases. the primary structure of the cellodextrinase showed over 40% similarity with endoglucanase 3 from f. succinogenes s85. short regions of similarity were also demonstrated with endoglucanase c from clostridium thermocellum, cela from ruminococcus flavefaciens, and two exoglucanases from yeast.

TI  == analyses of the gene and amino acid sequence of the prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola 23 xylanase reveals unexpected homology with endoglucanases from other genera of bacteria.
AB  == the dna sequence for the xylanase gene from prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola 23 was determined. the xylanase gene encoded for a protein with a molecular weight of 65,740. an apparent leader sequence of 22 amino acids was observed. the promoter region for expression of the xylanase gene in bacteroides species was identified with a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. a region of high amino acid homology was found with the proposed catalytic domain of endoglucanases from several organisms, including butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and clostridium thermocellum. the cloned xylanase was  found to exhibit endoglucanase activity against carboxymethyl cellulose. analysis of the codon usage for the xylanase gene found a bias towards g and c in the third position in 16 of 18 amino acids with degenerate codons.

TI  == sequence of a cellulase gene from the rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens 17.
AB  == a cellulase gene (enda) was isolated from a library of ruminococcus flavefaciens  strain 17 dna fragments inserted in puc13. the enda product showed activity against acid-swollen cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose, lichenan, cellopentaose  and cellotetraose, but showed no activity against cellotriose or binding to avicel. nucleotide sequencing indicated an encoded product of 455 amino acids which showed significant sequence similarity (ranging from 56% to 61%) with three endoglucanases from ruminococcus albus, and with clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase e. little relatedness was found with a cellodextrinase previously isolated from r. flavefaciens fd1.
