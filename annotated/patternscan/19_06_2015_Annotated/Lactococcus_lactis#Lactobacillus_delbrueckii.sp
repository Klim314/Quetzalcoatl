TI  == proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  == we examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of lb bulgaricum plc for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) grown in goat milk. the aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by lab, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (opa) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. the proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis l598, streptococcus thermophilus t3d1, dt1, lactobacillus lactis 1043 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. the proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella cholere enteridis, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterobacter aerogenes. the most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. the starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. the greatest antimicrobial activity  of the cultures was detected against e. aerogenes. the obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. the present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of lb bulgaricum plc.

TI  == new lactic acid bacterial strains from traditional mongolian fermented milk products have altered adhesion to porcine gastric mucin depending on the carbon source.
AB  == attachment of lactic acid bacteria to the mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is a major property of probiotics. here, we examined the ability of 21 lactic acid bacterial strains isolated from traditional fermented milk products in mongolia to adhere to porcine gastric mucin in vitro. higher attachment was observed with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains 6-8 and 8-1 than with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (positive control). lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain 7-1 adhered to mucin as effectively as did strain gg. heat inactivation decreased the adhesive ability of strains 6-8 and 8-1 but did not affect strain 7-1. the adhesion of strains 6-8, 7-1 and 8-1 was significantly inhibited when the cells were pretreated with periodate and trypsin, indicating that proteinaceous and carbohydrate-like cell surface compounds are involved in the adhesion of these strains. the adhesion of strain 7-1 was affected by the type of carbohydrate present in the growth medium, being higher with fructose than with lactose, galactose or xylose as the carbon source. the sugar content of 7-1 cells grown on various carbohydrates was negatively correlated with its adhesive ability. we provide new probiotic candidate strains and new information  regarding carbohydrate preference that influences lactic acid bacterial adhesion  to mucin.

TI  == effects of ingesting milk fermented by lactococcus lactis h61 on skin health in young women: a randomized double-blind study.
AB  == we conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effects of fermented milk produced using only lactococcus lactis strain h61 as a starter bacterium (h61-fermented milk) on the general health and various skin properties of young women. healthy female volunteers (n=23; age=19-21r) received h61-fermented milk (10(10) cfu of strain h61/d) or conventional yogurt (10(10) cfu of both lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus per day), as a reference food, daily for 4 wk. before and at the end of 4 wk, blood samples were taken, and skin hydration (inner forearms and cheek) and melanin content, elasticity, and sebum content (cheek only) were measured. skin hydration at the inner forearm was higher at wk 4 than at wk 0 in both groups. sebum content in cheek rose significantly after intervention in the h61-fermented milk  group, but not the conventional yogurt group. other skin parameters did not differ in either group. serum analysis showed that total protein concentration and platelet count were elevated and reactive oxygen species decreased in both groups after the intervention. although h61-fermented milk and conventional yogurt had similar effects on skin status and some blood characteristics of participants, an increase of sebum content in cheek is preferable to h61-fermented milk. as skin lipids contribute to maintaining the skin barrier, h61-fermented milk would provide beneficial effects on skin for young women.

TI  == co-culture fermentation of peanut-soy milk for the development of a novel functional beverage.
AB  == most of the commercial probiotic products are dairy-based, and the development of non-dairy probiotic products could be an alternative for new functional products. the peanut-soy milk (psm(1)) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (lab), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37 degrees c and afterwards, another 24h at +/-4 degrees  c. the pediococcus acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), lactococcus lactis (cct 0360), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr 32) probiotic lab, and the lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus (lb 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of  about 8.3log cfu/ml during fermentation. however, these strains were not able to  acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. the lactobacillus acidophilus (laca 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35  g/l) and rapidly lowered the ph (4.6). saccharomyces cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in psm and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24 g/l). in pure culture, s. cerevisiae (ufla  yffbm 18.03), l. rhamnosus (lr 32), l. acidophilus (laca 4), and p. acidilactici  (ufla bffcx 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). however, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population  of 8log cfu/ml in psm. lactic acid production increased, and 12 h was required to reach a ph value of 4.3. in general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. an average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1) and l. acidophilus (laca 4), and by co-culture of  p. acidilactici (ufla bffcx 27.1), l. acidophilus (laca 4) and s. cerevisiae (ufla yffbm 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51 g/l, respectively). the final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.

TI  == in vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of vastedda-like cheese.
AB  == twelve lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously selected in vitro (gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for  the continuous four-season production of vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. the strains belonged to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and streptococcus thermophilus. lab were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth  of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (wbm) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in wbm and raw milk. the strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a ph drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. after 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in ph values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only lc. lactis subsp. cremoris pon153, ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides pon259 and  pon559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees c. a sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (pdo) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (spme) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (gc/ms). the dominance of lactococci over thermophilic lab of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of voc profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of vastedda-like cheese.

TI  == microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  == the study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of st-nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. on the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named tr15 (truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: tr15-sc (58  isolates from tr15 collection), tr15-m (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and tr15-bhi (pools of isolates from bhi medium). their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk  were compared with the activity of complex consortium tr15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii). the natural consortium tr15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium tr15-bhi. the dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16s rdna sequencing and direct 16s rdna single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. the combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium tr15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics  than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such  as carnobacterium maltaromaticum, vagococcus fluvialis, enterococcus gilvus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas psychrophila and enterobacter spp.). the highest l. monocytogenes count was on rind with tr15-m and was positively associated with the highest ph value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by staphylococcus vitulinus, brevibacterium linens, microbacterium gubbeenense and brachybacterium tyrofermentans. the results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. it is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.

TI  == proteomic characterization of the acid tolerance response in lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cauh1 and functional identification of a novel acid stress-related transcriptional regulator ldb0677.
AB  == to overcome the deleterious effects of acid stress, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) elicits an adaptive response to acid stress. in this study, proteomics approach complemented by transcriptional analysis revealed some cellular changes in l. bulgaricus cauh1 during acid adaptation. we observed  an increase of glycolysis-associated proteins, promoting an optimal utilization of carbohydrates. also, rerouting of the pyruvate metabolism to fatty acid biosynthesis was observed, indicating a possible modification of the cell membrane rigidity and impermeability. in addition, expression of ribosomal protein s1 (rpsa) was repressed; however, the expression of ef-tu, ef-g and typa  was up-regulated at both protein and transcript levels. this suggests a reduction of protein synthesis in response to acid stress along with possible enhancement of the translational accuracy and protein folding. it is noteworthy that the putative transcriptional regulator ldb0677 was 1.84-fold up-regulated. heterologous expression of ldb0677 was shown to significantly enhance acid resistance in host strain lactococcus lactis. to clarify its role in transcriptional regulation network, the dna-binding specificity of ldb0677 was determined using bacterial one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. the identification of a binding motif (sstagacr) present in the promoter regions  of 22 genes indicates that it might function as a major regulator in acid stress  response in l. bulgaricus.

TI  == evaluation of lactic acid bacteria and yeast diversity in traditional white pickled and fresh soft cheeses from the mountain regions of serbia and lowland regions of croatia.
AB  == the goal of this study was the characterisation of indigenous lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts isolated from nine white pickled (bg) and nine fresh soft (zg) artisanal cheeses collected in serbia and croatia. while lab were present in all of the cheeses collected, yeasts were found in all bg cheeses but  only in three zg cheese samples. high lab and yeast species diversity was determined (average h'(l)=0.4 and h'(y)=0.8, respectively). the predominant lab species in white pickled (bg) cheeses were lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, while in fresh soft (zg) cheeses the most dominant lab species were l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides. among the 20 yeast species found, debaryomyces hansenii, candida zeylanoides, and torulaspora delbrueckii were found to be predominant in  bg cheeses, while yarrowia lipolytica was predominant in zg cheeses. the characterisation of metabolic and technological potentials revealed that 53.4% of lab isolates produced antimicrobial compounds, 44.3% of lab strains showed proteolytic activity, while most of the yeast species possessed either lipolytic  or proteolytic activity. in conclusion, the results obtained in this study showed that the composition of lab and yeast populations in white pickled and fresh soft cheeses is region specific. the knowledge gained in this study could eventually be used to select region specific lab and yeast strains for the production of white pickled and fresh soft artisanal cheeses with geographically specific origins under controlled conditions.

TI  == evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  == background: akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most west african countries. the identities of lab populations from dgge analysis and conventionally isolated lab and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by pcr sequencing analysis. the relationships between ph, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. results: the lab communities  in the akamu samples comprised mainly lactobacillus species, including lb. fermentum, lb. plantarum, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and lb. helveticus, as  well as lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. identified yeasts were candida tropicalis, candida albicans, clavispora lusitaniae and saccharomyces paradoxus.  low ph (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). ash was  either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kj g(-)(1). conclusion: the akamu samples were  predominantly starchy foods and had ph < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative lab.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

TI  == determination of the mode of action of enterolysin a, produced by enterococcus faecalis b9510.
AB  == aim: the current study aimed to visualize the damage caused by enterolysin a to the cells of sensitive strains and to find out cleavage site within the peptidoglycan moiety of bacterial cell walls. methods and results: enterolysin a  produced by a local isolate, enterococcus faecalis b9510 was found to rapidly kill cells of the sensitive strain lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 2144 during 120 min of treatment as compared to the untreated control where no such effect was observed. transmission electron microscopy of the enterolysin a-treated cells revealed leaking of the cytoplasmic contents ultimately resulting in complete lysis of cell walls. to find the cleavage site, purified cell walls of l. lactis  ssp. cremoris 2144, pediococcus pentosaceus 43201 and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 were treated with enterolysin a, and liberated amino acids were derivatized for n and c terminals and analysed using thin layer chromatography on silica gel with isopropanol as solvent. the results showed that enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds at two locations within peptidoglycan subunits. the first location is between l-alanine and d-glutamic acid of the stem peptide and the other location is between l-lysine of the stem peptide and d-aspartic acid of the interpeptide bridge. conclusions: enterolysin a cleaves the peptide bonds within the stem peptide as well as in the interpeptide bridge of gram-positive bacterial cell walls. this gives a possible reason for the broad spectrum of enterolysin a activity. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report identifying the cleavage site of enterolysin a within the cell walls of sensitive bacteria. this will help in identifying potential applications for enterolysin a.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for bacterial identification at the species level in  probiotic food and yoghurts. probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in columbia and lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) for the detection and quantification of lactobacillus sp. bacterial identification was performed by maldi-tof analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16s rdna genes. we tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qpcr that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of lactobacillus spp. dna/g. all products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. these bacteria were  identified as lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, bifidobacterium animalis,  lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus. maldi-tof ms presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. in one product we found l. lactis, instead of bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another  l. delbrueckii and s. thermophilus instead of bifidus spp. maldi-tof ms allows a  rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. practical application: maldi-tof ms is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics  are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.

TI  == a survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  == kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in tibet (china). it is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. in this study, a bacterial 16s rrna gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total dna extracted from 30 samples of kurut. after screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (otu) with unique rflp patterns were obtained. then, 1 representative sequence of every otu was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. the representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and acetobacter. in addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in genbank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. the characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.

TI  == effects of roundup((r)) and glyphosate on three food microorganisms: geotrichum candidum, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == use of many pesticide products poses the problem of their effects on environment  and health. amongst them, the effects of glyphosate with its adjuvants and its by-products are regularly discussed. the aim of the present study was to shed light on the real impact on biodiversity and ecosystems of roundup((r)), a major  herbicide used worldwide, and the glyphosate it contains, by the study of their effects on growth and viability of microbial models, namely, on three food microorganisms (geotrichum candidum, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) widely used as starters in traditional and industrial dairy technologies. the presented results evidence that roundup((r)) has an inhibitory effect on microbial growth and a microbicide  effect at lower concentrations than those recommended in agriculture. interestingly, glyphosate at these levels has no significant effect on the three  studied microorganisms. our work is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that the toxic effect of glyphosate was amplified by its formulation adjuvants on different human cells and other eukaryotic models. moreover, these results should be considered in the understanding of the loss of microbiodiversity and microbial concentration observed in raw milk for many years.

TI  == the impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  == understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (fmp) containing a consortium of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris,  and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced fmp strains. no significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed  in the feces of humans consuming the fmp. only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the fmp consortium. however, rna-seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the fmp strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. b. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the fmp consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. the human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of fmp consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to  plant polysaccharide metabolism. these experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of fmps on the human gut microbiome.

TI  == culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  == in order to investigate the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, dna was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions with variable length were amplified. the standard universal reverse primer l1 aligning to bacterial 23s rdna was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. therefore, l1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers gplusr and gminusr aligning to the adjacent, more conserved dna region. the amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. from representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. sequencing revealed that the samples contained lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, streptococcus macedonicus, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, debaromyces hansenii, mucor fragilis, yarrowia lipolytica and galactomyces geotrichum. these results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese. the introduced automated ribosomal dna intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.

AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. we collected 66 samples of the traditional mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 lab strains were isolated and identified based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence. the predominant species of those products were lactobacillus (l.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and lactococcus lactis ssp.  lactis. however, we could not detect any lab strains from eezgii. all lab isolates were screened for tolerance to low ph and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to caco-2 cells. in vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as l. plantarum or l. paracasei subspecies, based on 16s ribosomal dna and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. these strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the dornogovi province.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == development of a pentaplex pcr assay for the simultaneous detection of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. helveticus, l. fermentum in whey starter for grana  padano cheese.
AB  == a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. fermentum, was developed. the target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (l. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (l. fermentum). the analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived  from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus and enterococcus genera. the identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)cfu/ml. this new molecular assay was used to investigate the lab  population by direct extraction of dna from the 12 whey cultures for grana padano. the pentaplex pcr assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor lab community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria by broth microdilution method and etest.
AB  == we applied two methods of broth microdilution and etest for measuring minimal inhibition concentration (mic) of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for 15  antimicrobial agents to compare the feasibility, reproducibility, and equivalence of the two methods. both methods were originally described by the european projects prosafe and ace-art. in 84% combinations of strains and antimicrobial agents mic differences between the two methods were within one log(2) dilution. in the case of rifampicin the difference between the two methods was more than ten-fold. we further determined mics of 70 strains (14 strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 16 strains of lactococcus lactis, 30 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and 10 strains of bifidobacterium longum) by the broth microdilution method. in most cases, mic distributions were uni-modal and within 5 log(2) dilutions except for the mic distribution of l. lactis to the aminoglycoside group which was broader. these data are a good basis for improving knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and can be used to revise tentative epidemiological cut-off values.

TI  == volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  == aims: to investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. methods and  results: probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc55730 and l. reuteri br11), lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc4797, l. plantarum atcc14917 and  lactococcus lactis mg1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (spme) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (spme/gc/pfpd). several vscs were  identified including h(2)s, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. the vsc profiles varied substantially for different strains of l. plantarum and l. reuteri and it was found that l. reuteri atcc55730 and l.  lactis mg1363 produced the lowest levels of vscs (p < 0.05). levels of vscs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found  in commercial cheeses. conclusions: several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of vscs and substantial variations in vsc generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. significance and importance of the study: this study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are  able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore  has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == rep-pcr characterization and biochemical selection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the delta area of egypt.
AB  == samples of raw milk and traditional dairy products were collected from different  rural areas in the delta region. 170 isolates from these products were identified using repetitive genomic element-pcr (rep-pcr) fingerprinting. the identified isolates were tested for efficiency of biomass production and separation, acidifying activity, autolytic and aminopeptidase properties, antagonistic activities and exopolysaccharide production. the obtained results revealed that the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, enterococcus faecium lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were the predominant species in egyptian dairy products. two percent of lactococcus, 10% of lactobacillus and 1% of enterococcus isolates showed fast acidifying activity. aminopeptidase and autolytic properties were generally higher for most lactobacillus strains when compared to other strains. among these species, lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei was the highest in aminopeptidase activity and autolytic properties. antagonistic activity was detected in 40% of lactococcus, 70% of lactobacillus and 50% of enterococcus isolates. some isolates produced exopolysaccharides in milk and dairy products.

TI  == microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of caciocavallo silano pdo cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity of sixty-three natural whey cultures (nwcs) for the manufacture of caciocavallo silano cheese pdo was studied. the nwcs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of pdo production including five different regions of southern italy. the microbial species diversity was determined by direct dna extraction from nwcs and polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplification of variable regions of the 16s rrna gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc). dgge and dhplc fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. the dhplc technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as dgge in profiling species diversity in nwcs. cluster analysis of dgge and dhplc data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the nwcs. the presence of three groups of 10-14 nwcs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the nwcs for caciocavallo silano cheese pdo. a rapd-pcr analysis of the nwcs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical nwcs included  different biotypes. the sequences of dgge bands and dhplc peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic lactococcus lactis also occurred in some nwcs. in conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of nwcs used for the  caciocavallo silano pdo cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. the microbiota of fermented pdo products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.

TI  == bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == with the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (labs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis il1403 was studied. cph fused to the alpha-amylase (amy) of streptococcus bovis 148 either at its c-terminus (cph-amy) or at its n-terminus (amy-cph) was expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli. this domain was able to direct binding of amy to the surface of l. lactis atcc 19435 in both constructs. however, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of cph-amy were 3 and 14 times greater  than those in the case of amy-cph, respectively. of the labs tested, l. lactis atcc 19435 showed the highest binding capability for cph-amy, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). the binding of cph-amy to the surface of lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). the production of cph-amy in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. the results of this study suggest the usefulness of cph as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in e. coli. furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of cph in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.

TI  == microbial dynamics of castelmagno pdo, a traditional italian cheese, with a focus on lactic acid bacteria ecology.
AB  == the dynamics of dominant microflora throughout the manufacture and ripening processes were evaluated in three batches of traditional castelmagno pdo cheese.  milk, curd and cheese samples, at different stages during cheesemaking, were collected and subjected to culture-dependent and -independent analysis. traditional plating and genetic identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates, and pcr-dgge analysis of v1 region of 16s rrna gene were carried out. the collected samples were also monitored by hplc for the presence of organic acids, sugars and ketones. lab resulted to be the prevailing microflora in all production stages although enterococci, coagulase-negative cocci and yeasts also  showed considerable viable counts probably related to the presence, in the dairy  samples analysed, of free short-chain fatty acids detected by hplc. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was the species most frequently isolated during castelmagno  pdo manufacture, while lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus paracasei were isolated with the highest frequencies from ripened castelmagno pdo cheese samples. occasionally strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens and lactobacillus casei were isolated. the results obtained on castelmagno pdo microflora underlines a partial correspondence between culture-dependent method and dgge analysis. thus, in this  study, it is highlighted once more the importance to combine molecular culture-independent approaches with classical microbiological methods for the study of complex environmental communities occurring in food matrices.

TI  == [gene regulation to lactic acid bacteria for increasing production of flavor metabolite].
AB  == abstract: the major flavor substances lactic acid bacteria produced include the buttermilk aroma butanedione, the yoghurt flavor acetaldehyde and the amino acid. metabolic engineering in lab had focused primarily on rerouting of pyruvate metabolism towards butanedione or acetaldehyde to improve the flavor of fermented milk, which has considerable economic value. the typical yogurt flavor is caused  by acetaldehyde produced through many different pathways. the attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which encoded by the glya gene. in addition, the efficient conversion of glucose into acetaldehyde was achieved by over-expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and nadh oxidase in lab. the concentration of acetaldehyde derived from this regulation is higher than the other strategy. as for the regulation of butanedione, it was focused on combinating inactivation of  alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase with low lactate dehydrogenase activity, or with overproduction of nadh-oxidase, or with overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase. then the possibility of co-regulation with certain three kinds of enzyme above was recommended.

TI  == comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  == while plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. in this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pdoj1, from a strain of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. it consisted of a circular dna molecule of 6,220 bp with a g+c content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (orfs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. comparative analysis of pdoj1 and the other available l. delbrueckii plasmids (plbb1, pjbl2, pn42, and pll1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino  acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted orfs from pdoj1, reflecting a common origin for l. delbrueckii plasmids. analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group b plasmids from streptococcus thermophilus. this observation and the ability of the replicon to function in s. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in l. delbrueckii was likely from s. thermophilus. this may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. as no vector based on plasmid replicons from l. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an escherichia coli-l. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pdoj4, was constructed from pdoj1, the p15a ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pci372, and the  lacz polylinker from puc18. this cloning vector was successfully introduced into  e. coli, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. this shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == multiplex pcr for the detection and identification of dairy bacteriophages in milk.
AB  == bacteriophage infections of starter lactic acid bacteria are a serious risk in the dairy industry. phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. the associated economic losses can be substantial. rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. this study describes a simple and rapid multiplex pcr method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (p335, 936  and c2). available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. these primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions.

TI  == the toxicity and decreased concentration of aflatoxin b in natural lactic acid fermented maize meal.
AB  == aims: aflatoxin b(1) (afb(1)) is a mycotoxin which is known to frequently contaminate poorly stored food products destined for human consumption. this study was carried out to investigate the potential activity of lactic acid fermentation in reducing afb(1) level in fermented maize meal products. methods and results: maize meal was spiked with 60 mug g(-1) afb(1) and fermented, with or without starter culture, for 4 days at 25 degrees c. unbound afb(1) in solution and the ph of the media were monitored daily. a significant decrease (p  < 0.05) in the level of unbound afb(1) was observed (75% in the fourth day). simultaneously, a progressive decrease in the ph of the media from 6.5 to 3.1 was also observed. afb(1) was below the detection limit in commercial fermented porridge (amahewu) samples. cytotoxicity tests on afb(1)-spiked fermented extracts showed that those with a starter culture were comparatively less toxic (30-36%) than those with no added starter culture (24-30%). however, this difference was not significant (p > 0.05). conclusions: these results indicate that lactic acid fermentation can significantly reduce the concentration of afb(1) in maize to trace levels. however, the safety of fermented products has not been well studied, as the mechanism of afb(1) removal is not well understood. significance and impact of the study: natural fermentation may potentially reduce exposure to natural toxins occurring in food.

AB  == we report the oral vaccination of swiss mice with an aro attenuated salmonella enterica var. typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the 14-kda schistosoma mansoni antigen, sm14. bacterial adjuvants, including (i) lactococcus lactis expressing interleukin-12 (il-12) and (ii) lactobacillus delbrueckii ufv-h2b20, were also employed in oral immunization assays. detection assays to specific igg  and iga anti-sm14 antibodies were performed to evaluate humoral immune responses  in vaccinated mice. an increase in specific igg titers was observed; however, no  iga production was detected. the protection levels against schistosomiasis (34.9-49.5%) obtained with all experimental formulations in this work were very similar to values reported by previous studies, which used purified recombinant sm14 for parenteral vaccination of mice. there was a slight reduction in hepatic  granulomas of mice vaccinated with salmonella. oogram studies showed diminished numbers of s. mansoni eggs in the intestinal wall of vaccinated mice, but individual female worm fecundity did not seem to be affected by our immunization  protocol.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

AB  == numerous industrial bacteria generate hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)), which may inhibit the growth of other bacteria in mixed ecosystems. we isolated spontaneous oxidative-stress-resistant (spox) lactococcus lactis mutants by using a natural selection method with milk-adapted strains on dairy culture medium containing h(2)o(2). three spox mutants displayed greater h(2)o(2) resistance. one of them,  spox3, demonstrated better behavior in different oxidative-stress situations: (i) higher long-term survival upon aeration in lm17 and milk and (ii) the ability to  grow with h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii strains. furthermore, the transit kinetics of the spox3 mutant in the digestive tract of a human flora-associated mouse model was not affected.

AB  == the effect of incorporating a highly autolytic strain (lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus ul12) a proteolytic strain (lactobacillus casei subsp. casei l2a), or a nisin z-producing strain (lactococcus lactis, subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ul719) into cheddar cheese starter culture (lactococcus lactis kb and lactococcus cremoris kb) on physicochemical and rheological properties of the resultant cheeses was examined. cheeses were ripened at 7 degrees c and analyzed  over a 6-mo period for viable lactococcal and lactobacilli counts, ph, titratable acidity (ta), lipolysis, proteolysis, and textural characteristics. the combination of the nisin-producing strain and autolytic adjuncts significantly increased the production of water-soluble nitrogen, free amino acids, and free fatty acids. the effect of lc. diacetylactis ul719 alone or of lb. casei l2a on water-soluble nitrogen and free amino acid contents were also significant, whereas their effect on free fatty acids was not. viable counts of lb. bulgaricus ul12 were significantly reduced in the presence of lc. diacetylactis ul719. lactobacilli-containing cheeses showed significantly lower values for hardness, fracturability, and springiness. it could be concluded that the addition of lb. bulgaricus ul12 together with a nisin-producing strain produces a greater increase in cheese proteolysis and an improvement in cheddar cheese texture.

TI  == heterologous expression of lactose- and galactose-utilizing pathways from lactic  acid bacteria in corynebacterium glutamicum for production of lysine in whey.
AB  == the genetic determinants for lactose utilization from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 and galactose utilization from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg 1363 were heterologously expressed in the lysine-overproducing strain corynebacterium glutamicum atcc 21253. the c. glutamicum strains expressing the lactose permease and beta-galactosidase genes of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus exhibited beta-galactosidase activity in excess of 1000 miller  units/ml of cells and were able to grow in medium in which lactose was the sole carbon source. similarly, c. glutamicum strains containing the lactococcal aldose-1-epimerase, galactokinase, udp-glucose-1-p-uridylyltransferase, and udp-galactose-4-epimerase genes in association with the lactose permease and beta-galactosidase genes exhibited beta-galactosidase levels in excess of 730 miller units/ml of cells and were able to grow in medium in which galactose was the sole carbon source. when grown in whey-based medium, the engineered c. glutamicum strain produced lysine at concentrations of up to 2 mg/ml, which represented a 10-fold increase over the results obtained with the lactose- and galactose-negative control, c. glutamicum 21253. despite their increased catabolic flexibility, however, the modified corynebacteria exhibited slower growth rates and plasmid instability.

TI  == resin straw as an alternative system to securely store frozen microorganisms.
AB  == freezing of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms is the main interest in the study of cold stress responses of living organisms. in parallel, applications which arise from this approach are of two types: (i) optimization of the frozen starters used in food processing; and (ii) improvement of the ex situ preservation of microorganisms in collections. currently, cryopreservation of microorganisms in collections is carried out in cryotubes, and bibliographical references related to freezing microorganisms packaged in straws are scarce. in this context, a preliminary study was completed to evaluate the technological potential of ionomeric resin straws compared to polycarbonate cryo-tubes. survival under freezing stress was tested on three microorganisms selected for their biotechnological interest: two lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and a deuteromycete fungus, geotrichum candidum. the stress was carried out by repeated freezing-thawing cycles to artificially accelerate the lethal effect of freezing  on the microorganisms. two main results were obtained: (i) the survival rate values (per freezing-thawing cycle) seems to depend on the thermal type of the studied microorganism, and (ii) there was no, under our experimental conditions,  significant difference between straws and tubes. however, conservation in the resin straws lead to a slight increase in the survival of l. cremoris and g. candidum compared to microtubes. in those conditions, straws seems an alternative system to securely store frozen microorganisms with three main characteristics: (i) a high resistance to thermal stress, (ii) a safe closing by hermetic weld, and (iii) a system for inviolable identification.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == the effect of temperature and ph on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a ph-auxostat study.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == determination of the domain of the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cell surface proteinase prtb involved in attachment to the cell wall after heterologous expression of the prtb gene in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == belonging to the subtilase family, the cell surface proteinase (csp) prtb of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus differs from other csps synthesized by lactic acid bacteria. expression of the prtb gene under its own promoter was shown to complement the proteinase-deficient strain mg1363 (prtp(-) prtm(-)) of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. surprisingly, the maturation process of prtb, unlike that of lactococcal csp prtps, does not require a specific prtm-like chaperone. the carboxy end of prtb was previously shown to be different from the  consensus anchoring region of other csps and exhibits an imperfect duplication of 59 amino acids with a high lysine content. by using a deletion strategy, the removal of the last 99 amino acids, including the degenerated anchoring signal (lpkkt), was found to be sufficient to release a part of the truncated prtb into  the culture medium and led to an increase in prtb activity. this truncated prtb is still active and enables l. lactis mg1363 to grow in milk supplemented with glucose. by contrast, deletion of the last 806 amino acids of prtb led to the secretion of an inactive proteinase. thus, the utmost carboxy end of prtb is involved in attachment to the bacterial cell wall. proteinase prtb constitutes a  powerful tool for cell surface display of heterologous proteins like antigens.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, the peptidoglycan hydrolases content and the effect of pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysins on cell lysis. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the strains tested showed an extent of autolysis ranging between 40 and 90% after 48 h of starvation at 37 degrees c. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity and a major activity band migrating at about 116 kda was detected. additional secondary lytic bands migrating in a range of molecular weight between 45 and 110 kda were also detected. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 15 mm cacl2 and in a range of ph between 5 and 9.5 but was strongly reduced in presence of 8% nacl and in the presence of protease inhibitors. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolases of pediococcus  strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. lytic activity was detected against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus  and listeria monocytogenes. the interaction between pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysis was evaluated and a relevant effect of bacteriocin in cell-induced lysis was observed. conclusions: the autolytic phenotype is widely distributed among p. acidilactici and p. pentosaceus and the rate of autolysis is high in the majority of the analysed strains. several autolytic bands, detected by renaturing sds-page, retained their activity against several lactic acid bacteria and l. monocytogenes. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the  autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus strains should expand the knowledge of their role in fermentation processes where these species  occur as primary or secondary bacterial population.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == cell-wall proteinases prts and prtb have a different role in streptococcus thermophilus/lactobacillus bulgaricus mixed cultures in milk.
AB  == the manufacture of yoghurt relies on the simultaneous utilization of two starters: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb. bulgaricus). a protocooperation usually takes place between the two species, which often results in enhanced milk acidification and aroma formation compared to pure cultures. cell-wall proteinases of lactococcus lactis  and lactobacilli have been shown to be essential to growth in milk in pure cultures. in this study, the role of proteinases prts from s. thermophilus and prtb from lb. bulgaricus in bacterial growth in milk was evaluated; a negative mutant for the prts gene of s. thermophilus cnrz 385 was constructed for this purpose. pure cultures of s. thermophilus cnrz 385 and its prts-negative mutant were made in milk as well as mixed cultures of s. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus: s. thermophilus cnrz 385 or its prts-negative mutant was associated with several strains of lb. bulgaricus, including a prtb-negative strain. the ph  and growth of bacterial populations of the resulting mixed cultures were followed, and the lactobacillus strain was found to influence both the extent of  the benefit of lb. bulgaricus/s. thermophilus association on milk acidification and the magnitude of s. thermophilus population dominance at the end of fermentation. in all mixed cultures, the sequential growth of s. thermophilus then of lb. bulgarius and finally of both bacteria was observed. although proteinase prts was essential to s. thermophilus growth in milk in pure culture,  it had no effect on bacterial growth and thus on the final ph of mixed cultures in the presence of prtb. in contrast, proteinase prtb was necessary for the growth of s. thermophilus, and its absence resulted in a higher final ph. from these results, a model of growth of both bacteria in mixed cultures in milk is proposed.

TI  == food-grade delivery system for controlled gene expression in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a food-grade system for the delivery of desired genes to lactococcus lactis, their inducible expression, and their transfer to related strains was established. based on the thermosensitive pg(+)host replicon, two types of plasmid vectors were constructed which contained sections of either the chromosomal leu operon of l. lactis or the tel operon from the lactococcal sex factor. genes cloned into the leu or tel sequences of these vectors were delivered to the homologous regions of the chromosome or the sex factor through two single crossovers, leading to integration of the recombinant plasmids and subsequent excision of the vector portions. inducible transcription of integrated genes was achieved by using the nisin-controlled expression (nice) system. to establish the signal transduction genes nisrk in l. lactis, the vectors plng1363  (targeted to the chromosome) and puk500 (targeted to the sex factor) were constructed. fusions of six different peptidase genes (pep) from lactobacillus delbrueckii with the nisin-inducible promoter p(nisa) were delivered to the sex factor with derivatives of the vector puk300. food-grade recombinants of l. lactis were constructed which had the nisrk genes and individual p(nisa)::pep fusions integrated either separately into the chromosome and the sex factor or simultaneously into the sex factor. with both types of recombinants, expression of p(nisa)::pep fusions after induction with nisin was demonstrated. depending on the loci used for integration of nisrk, variable induction rates were observed. furthermore, an engineered sex factor carrying a p(nisa)::pepi fusion was transfered by conjugation between two strains of l. lactis at a frequency of 4 x  10(-4).

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckiisubsp. bulgaricus produces exopolysaccharides (epss), which play a role in the rheological properties of fermented food products. lb. bulgaricus lfi5 produces a high-molecular-weight eps composed of galactose, glucose, and rhamnose in the molar ratio 5:1:1. an 18-kb dna region containing 14 genes, designated epsa to epsn, was isolated by genomic dna library screening and inverted pcr. the predicted gene products are homologous to proteins involved in  the biosynthesis of other bacterial polysaccharides and the genetic organization  was found to be similar to that of other eps clusters from lactic acid bacteria.  transcriptional analysis revealed that the 14 eps genes are co-ordinately expressed and transcribed as a single mrna of 15-16 kb. the transcription start site of the promoter was mapped upstream of the first gene, epsa. genes encoding  glycosyltranferases were further studied by heterologous expression and functional assays. we showed that the epse gene product is a phospho-glucosyltransferase initiating the biosynthesis of eps. heterologous expression of epse in a lactococcus lactis epsdmutant restored eps production, demonstrating its role and importance in eps biosynthesis. functional assays of other glycosyltransferases allowed their sugar specificity to be elucidated and an overall biosynthetic pathway for eps synthesis by lb. bulgaricus to be proposed.

TI  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized  by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among  probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and  their survival in the products during cold storage.

TI  == dna sequence and functional analysis of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis plasmids pn42 and pjbl2.
AB  == the plasmids pn42 and pjbl2 were isolated from the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis strains ncc88 and jcl414. dna sequence determination and bioinformatic analysis revealed a strikingly conserved genetic organization containing five major, highly conserved open reading frames (orfs). transformation studies indicated that orf2 (consisting of a primase fused to a replicative dna helicase), ori, and orf3 constitute the minimal requirements for  replication of pn42 in the heterologous host lactococcus lactis. the orf1's are predicted to encode type i restriction-modification (r-m) system hsds subunits with different specificities on either plasmid, suggesting that these plasmids may be involved in host defense by expanding their host r-m system repertoire. these plasmids constitute the basis for the construction of novel l. delbrueckii  vectors.

TI  == autolytic phenotype of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from traditional tunisian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic properties of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from artisan tunisian dairy products, their peptidoglycan hydrolase content and their activity spectrum. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of lactococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the results obtained highlighted a high degree of diversity among the strains analysed, allowing the identification of high and low autolytic lactococcus lactis strains. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sds-page using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the  enzymatic activity. a major activity band migrating at about 45 kda was observed. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 8% nacl, 15 mmol l(-1) cacl2, and in a ph range between 5 and 9.5. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolase from lactococcus strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. the major autolysin of lactococcus lactis was active against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and listeria monocytogenes. conclusions: autolytic activity is widely distributed in lactococcus lactis and the rate of autolysis is strain-dependent. the major peptidoglycan hydrolase showed a wide spectrum of activity against several lactic acid bacteria and bacterial species involved in food-related infection. significance and impact of the study: the autolytic phenotype of lactococcus lactis strains isolated from tunisian artisan dairy products has been determined, and the data obtained should allow the selection of strains of technological interest in the cheese-ripening process.

TI  == diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna analysis.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in sicily (italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. the latter included pcr, reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes (rdna). bacterial and lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the v6 to v8 and v1 to  v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene, respectively. dgge profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. cloning and sequencing of rdna amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab), including species of leuconostoc, lactococcus lactis, and macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. other thermophilic lab, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. comparison of the rrna-derived patterns obtained by rt-pcr to the rdna dgge patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. identification of cultivated lab isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16s rdna clone libraries, with the significant exception of the lactobacillus delbrueckii  species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. the present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == regulation and adaptive evolution of lactose operon expression in lactobacillus delbrueckii.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis are  both used in the dairy industry as homofermentative lactic acid bacteria in the production of fermented milk products. after selective pressure for the fast fermentation of milk in the manufacture of yogurts, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus loses its ability to regulate lac operon expression. a series of mutations led to the constitutive expression of the lac genes. a complex of insertion sequence (is) elements (isl4 inside isl5), inserted at the border of the lac promoter, induced the loss of the palindromic structure of one of the operators likely involved in the binding of regulatory factors. a lac repressor gene was discovered downstream of the beta-galactosidase gene of l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and was shown to be inactivated by several mutations in l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. regulatory mechanisms of the lac gene expression of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis were compared by heterologous expression in lactococcus lactis of the two lac promoters in front of a reporter gene (beta-glucuronidase) in the presence or absence of the lac repressor gene. insertion of the complex of is elements in the lac promoter of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus increased the promoter's activity but did not prevent repressor binding; rather, it increased the affinity of the repressor for the promoter. inactivation of the lac repressor by mutations was then necessary to induce the constitutive expression of the lac genes in l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.

TI  == [viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en venezuela].
AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

AB  == two fermented milks containing angiotensin-i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selected lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ss1 and l. lactis subsp. cremoris ft4. the ph 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest ace-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. the most inhibitory  fractions of the milk fermented by l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ss1 contained the sequences of beta-casein (beta-cn) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. those from the milk fermented by l. lactis subsp. cremoris ft4 contained the sequences of beta-cn f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and kappa-cn f155-160 and f152-160. most of these sequences had features in common with other  ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. in particular, the beta-cn f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-ii. some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. the 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic(50)s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). when the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ace-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the ic(50)s increased considerably. a strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or  by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB  == we examined (i) the persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 as a postpasteurization contaminant in fermented dairy products; (ii) the ability of e. coli o157:h7 strains with and without the general stress regulatory protein, rpos, to compete with commercial starter cultures in fermentation systems; and (iii) the survival of e. coli o157:h7 in the yogurt production process. in commercial products inoculated with 10(3) cfu/ml, e. coli o157:h7 was recovered for up to 12 days in yogurt (ph 4.0), 28 days in sour cream (ph 4.3), and at levels > 10(2) cfu/ml at 35 days in buttermilk (ph 4.1). for the starter culture  competition trials, the relative inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in the experimental fermentation systems was, in decreasing order, thermophilic culture  mixture, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus r110 alone, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis d280 alone, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris d62 alone, and streptococcus thermophilus c90 alone showing the least inhibition. recovery of the rpos mutant was lower than recovery of its wild-type parent by 72 h or earlier in the presence of individual starter cultures. no e. coli o157:h7 were recovered after the curd formation step in yogurt manufactured with milk inoculated with 10(5) cfu/ml. our results show that (i) postprocessing entry of e. coli o157:h7 into fermented dairy products represents a potential health hazard; (ii) commercial starter cultures differ in their ability to reduce e. coli o157:h7 cfu numbers in fermentation systems; and (iii) the rpos protein appears to most effectively contribute to bacterial survival in the presence of conditions that are moderately lethal to the cell.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophage genomes by modular exchanges followed by point mutations and small deletions and insertions.
AB  == comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group i phage phi sfi19 and the  cos site containing temperate phage phi sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. in a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. over the 17-kb-long dna segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from leuconostoc oenos phage l10, lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t, and streptococcus pneumoniae phage dp-1. a chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage bk5-t and phage  dp-1 proteins. the very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h and further phage proteins (lactococcus lactis, bacillus subtills). the similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. the putative phi sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. in a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the s, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. over the investigated 17-kb dna region phi sfi19 differed from phi sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. the base pair changes were unevenly distributed. over the leuconostoc phage-related dna the change rate was high, while over the lactococcus and s. pneumoniae phage-related dna the change rate was low. we speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales  for the modular exchange reactions observed in s. thermophilus phages.

TI  == characterization of a thiol-dependent endopeptidase from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32.
AB  == an endopeptidase gene (pepe) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32. the pepe gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kda. significant identity  was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepe and the sequences for aminopeptidase c from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis dsm7290, l. helveticus cnrz32, streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris am2. a recombinant pepe fusion protein containing an n-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. characterization of pepe revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kda, with optimum temperature, nacl concentration, and ph for activity at 32 to 37 degrees c, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. pepe had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees c, 4% nacl, ph 5.1). pepe hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.

TI  == plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  == bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. during lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host  chromosome at the 3' end of a trna(ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (l. dupont et al., j. bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). a nonreplicative vector (pmc1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attp site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei  (two strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. integrative recombination of pmc1 into the chromosomes  of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pmc1 attp site. the isolation and sequencing of pmc1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pmc1 integrated into the conserved trna(ser) gene. in the other bacterial species where this trna gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic dna were used. a consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. the comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide  cct at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.

TI  == genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis  and streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and carnobacterium, is reviewed. the genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 mbp. plasmids are common in lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in s. thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. five is elements have been found in l. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. is elements have been found in the genera lactobacillus and leuconostoc, but not in s. thermophilus. prophages are also a normal component of the l. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in s. thermophilus. physical and genetic maps for two l. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and s. thermophilus a054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn  operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. the l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the s. thermophilus map has 35. the maps indicate significant plasticity in the l. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. the cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. a number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the l. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. these tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and gram-positive bacteria. integration vectors based on temperate phage attb sites and the random insertion  of is elements have also been developed for l. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. in addition, a l. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with escherichia coli hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. with the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.

TI  == the proteolytic system of lactobacillus sanfrancisco cb1: purification and characterization of a proteinase, a dipeptidase, and an aminopeptidase.
AB  == a cell envelope 57-kda proteinase, a cytoplasmic 65-kda dipeptidase, and a 75-kda aminopeptidase were purified from lactobacillus sanfrancisco cb1 sourdough lactic acid bacterium by sequential fast protein liquid chromatography steps. all of the enzymes are monomers. the proteinase was most active at ph 7.0 and 40 degrees c,  while aminopeptidase and dipeptidase had optima at ph 7.5 and 30 to 35 degrees c. relatively high activities were observed at the ph and temperature of the sourdough fermentation. the proteinase is a serine enzyme. urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of digest of alpha s1- and beta-caseins showed differences in the pattern of peptides released by the purified proteinase and those produced by crude preparations of the cell envelope proteinases of lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp. bulgaricus b397 and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis sk11. reversed-phase  fast protein liquid chromatography of gliadin digests showed a more-complex peptide pattern produced by the proteinase of lactobacillus sanfrancisco cb1. the dipeptidase is a metalloenzyme with high affinity for dipeptides containing hydrophobic amino acids but had no activity on tripeptides or larger peptides. the aminopeptidase was also inhibited by metal-chelating agents, and showed a broad n-terminal hydrolytic activity including di- and tripeptides. km values of  0.70 and 0.44 mm were determined for the dipeptidase on leu-leu and the aminopeptidase on leu-p-nitroanilide, respectively.

TI  == detection and localization of peptidases in lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == an x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) gene from lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == the x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) of an industrially used lactobacillus helveticus strain has been detected by nucleic acid hybridization,  cloned, characterized and sequenced. one orf of 2379 bp with coding capacity for  a 90.6 kda protein (pepx) was found. the orf was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region. an inverted repeat structure with delta g of -84.1 kj mol-1 was found downstream of the coding region. the deduced amino acid sequence of the 90.6 kda protein showed 49.3, 49.4 and 77.7% homology with the pepx proteins from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, respectively. northern blotting revealed a 2.6 kb transcript and one transcription start site was identified via  primer extension analysis using an a.l.f. sequencer. in a bioreactor study, the expression of pepx in lb. helveticus was studied as a function of growth. transcription of pepx was typical of exponential growth phase expression. the pepx gene has been cloned into pkk223-3 and expressed at a high level in escherichia coli jm105. pepx was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. optimum pepx activity was observed at ph  6.5 and 45 degrees c. according to gel filtration analysis, pepx is a dimer of 165 kda. the enzyme was inactivated by heavy metal ions such as cu2+, cd2+ and zn2+. edta and 1,10-phenanthroline did not decrease pepx activity significantly.  it was completely inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and reactivated by adding dtt, and strongly inhibited by pmsf. pepx is thus a metal-independent serine peptidase having functional sulfhydryl groups at or near the active site.

AB  == the genes encoding the lysis proteins of lactococcus lactis bacteriophage phi lc3 were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. the phi lc3 lysis genes, lysa and lysb, encode a membrane-disrupting protein (lysa) of 88 amino acids, and a cell wall degrading protein (lysb) of 429 amino acids, which shares  significant sequence similarity with lysins from the streptococcus pneumoniae phages cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage mv1. both lysa and lysb function in e. coli, as judged by lysis of the e. coli host cells and by lytic activity against lactococcal cells when the cloned lysa and lysb genes are  expressed. the lysa protein possesses two putative transmembrane helices and highly charged n- and c-termini, and is structurally similar to phage holins that are known to induce lesions in the inner membrane through which phage endolysin can be released to its cell wall substrate. the c-terminal end of lysb contains two highly homologous sequence repeats of 43 amino acids. the lysb repeats show strong sequence similarity to repeats found in lytic enzymes from other gram-positive bacteria and from bacillus subtilis phage phi 29 and pza, as well as in some functionally unrelated proteins, and they are possibly involved in binding of the enzyme to the cell wall substrate. the organization of the dual phi lc3 lysis system supports earlier suggestions that exchange of modular units  is an important principle in protein evolution.
