TI  == longitudinal assessment of pigtailed macaque lower genital tract microbiota by pyrosequencing reveals dissimilarity to the genital microbiota of healthy humans.
AB  == vaginal bacterial communities play an important role in human health and have been shown to influence hiv infection. pigtailed macaques (macaca nemestrina) are used as an animal model of hiv vaginal infection of women. since the bacterial microbiota could influence retrovirus infection of pigtailed macaques, the genital microbiota in 10 cycling macaques was determined by pyrosequencing. the microbiota of all macaques was polymicrobial with a median of 13 distinct genera. strikingly, the genera sneathia and fusobacterium, both in the phylum fusobacteria, accounted for 18.9% and 13.3% of sequences while the next most frequent were prevotella (5.6%), porphyromonas (4.1%), atopobium (3.6%), and parvimonas (2.6%). sequences corresponding to lactobacillus comprised only 2.2% of sequences on average and were essentially all l. amylovorus. longitudinal sampling of the 10 macaques over an 8-week period, which spanned at least one full ovulatory cycle, showed a generally stable presence of the major types of bacteria with some exceptions. these studies show that the microbiota of the pigtailed macaques is substantially dissimilar to that found in most healthy humans, where the genital microbiota is usually dominated by lactobacillus sp. the polymicrobial makeup of the macaque bacterial populations, the paucity of lactobacilli, and the specific types of bacteria present suggest that the pigtailed macaque microbiota could influence vaginal retrovirus infection.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with dystocia and retained placenta in iraqi buffaloes.
AB  == the present study was conducted on 50 recently calved iraqi buffalo cows. depending on the kind of parturition, buffalo cows were divided into two main groups, the first group had normal unassisted parturition (np) (26 animals) and the second group with certain periparturent complications (ppc) (24 animals). after 24 h of parturition, these two groups were further subdivided into two groups as cows expel their foetal membranes in <24 h postpartum and referred as non-retained placenta (nrp) while cows that did not expel their foetal membrane after 24 h referred as retained placenta (rp). sampling for bacteriology, uterine discharge for polymorphonuclear cells per cent and blood samples for polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) and the enzyme creatine kinase activity were performed at 6, 24 and 48 h postpartum. in ppc group, the most prevalent bacteria after 6 h of calving were escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and lactobacillus acidophilus. total bacterial isolates in the uterus of buffaloes with rp in ppc group after 24 and 48 h were 129 and 183 respectively. among the isolates, archanobacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella melaninogenicus and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent isolates after  48 h of rp buffaloes in ppc group. polymorphonuclear neutrophil were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the uterine discharge than in blood in buffaloes with rp in both ppc and np groups. in conclusion, uterine contamination occurs as a result of postpartum ascending contamination by non-specific environmental organisms. the presence of lactobacillus sp. in the uterus indicated a healthy uterus. peripartum complications followed by retention of foetal membranes with the dominance of e. coli in the uterine lumen might favour  the colonization of other bacteria including facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic in the uterine wall of buffaloes.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. methods: studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. the model consisted of a mixed culture  of lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus epidermidis, prevotella bivia, and group d streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. the status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. results: challenge of the model with c albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in a decrease in c albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. however, treatment also altered other components of  the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. addition of clotrimazole  (100 micrograms/ml) to the system in the absence of c albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. conclusions: candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. clotrimazole, although effective against c albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the  normal vaginal microflora. one of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk  of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.
