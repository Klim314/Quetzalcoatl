TI  == design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  == twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. all the compounds had mics between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. in order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of  staphylococcus aureus. compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive  s. aureus (mssa) at mics of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa) at mics of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and mdr-mrsa at mic of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of s. aureus and haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. the majority of cells in biofilm populations of mssa and mrsa were eradicated at low level of 3, with mbics in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.

TI  == antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing bacillus subtilis kku213: potential as a probiotic strain.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of bacillus subtilis strain kku213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of a kku213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus. the antibacterial activity of the cfs precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (as) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees c, at ph 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. when analyzed by sds-page and overlaid with the indicator strains b. cereus and s. aureus, the 40% as precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kda. however, proteins larger than 25 kda and smaller than 10 kda were still observed on a native protein gel.  purified subtilosin a was prepared by amberlite xad-16 bead extraction and hplc and analyzed by nano-lc-qtof-ms. its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kda, and  it retained its antibacterial activity. these results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin a gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the kku213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of b. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. in addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin a, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the kku213 culture. the kku213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is  highly acid-resistant (ph 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing b. subtilis kku213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.

TI  == antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of garcinia cowa.
AB  == a phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones a (1) and b (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. all isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against bacillus cereus tistr 688, bacillus subtilis tistr 008, micrococcus luteus tistr  884, staphylococcus aureus tistr 1466, escherichia coli tistr 780, pseudomonas aeruginosa tistr 781, salmonella typhimurium tistr 292 and staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228. alpha-mangostin showed potent activity (mic 0.25-1 mug/ml) against three gram-positive strains and garcicowanone a and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against b. cereus with the same mic values of 0.25 mug/ml.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  == the antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.oh), superoxide anion radical (.o2(-)), methoxy radical (.ch2oh), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.co2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.no) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.dpph) radical. it reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising  activity against .co2(-), .ch2oh and .dpph radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .no, .o2(-) and .oh radicals (38%, 23% and 15%,  respectively). the antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. to varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (mic 0.003-0.038 mg/ml and mbc 0.013-0.052 mg/ml, mic 0.008-0.016 mg/ml and mfc 0.090-0.520 mg/ml, respectively). according to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.

TI  == capillary electrophoresis of microbial aggregates.
AB  == uncontrolled aggregation of bacterial cells is a significant disadvantage of electrophoretic separations. various aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of different strains of gram-positive bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus(1), and micrococcus luteus bacteria and gram-negative escherichia coli bacteria were investigated in this study. our findings indicate that bacteria can be rapidly analyzed by cze with surface charge modification by calcium ions (ca(2+)). bound ca(2+) ions increase zeta potential to more than 2.0 mv and significantly reduce repulsive forces. under the above conditions, bacterial cells create compact aggregates, and fewer high-intensity signals are observed in electropherograms. the above can be attributed to the bridging effect of ca(2+) between bacterial cells. ce was performed to analyze bacterial aggregates in an isotachophoretic mode. a single peak was observed in the electropherogram.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents of the leaves of mikania micrantha h. b. k.
AB  == background: to isolate plant-derived compounds with antimicrobial activity from the leaves of mikania micrantha, to determine the compounds configuration, and to evaluate their antimicrobial activity against eight plant pathogenic fungi (exserohilum turcicum, colletotrichum lagenarium, pseudoperonispora cubensis, botrytis cirerea, rhizoctonia solani, phytophthora parasitica, fusarium solani, and pythium aphanidermatum,) and four plant pathogenic bacteria (gram negative bacteria: ralstonia dolaanacearum, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, and xanthomonas campestris pv. citri), and four bacteria (gram positive bacteria: staphyloccocus aureus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and bacillus cereus). methods and results: antimicrobial constituents of the leaves of m. micrantha were isolated using bioactivity- guided fractionation. the antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by the inhibit hypha growth method and inhibit spore germination method. characterization of antibacterial activity was carried out using the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). mic and mbc were determined by the broth microdilution method. six compounds - deoxymikanolide, scandenolide, dihydroscandenolide, mikanolide, dihydromikanolide, and m - methoxy benzoic acid - have been isolated  from leaves of mikania micrantha h. b. k. deoxymikanolide, scandenolide, and dihydroscandenolide were new compounds. the result of bioassay showed that all of isolated compounds were effective against tested strains and deoxymikanolide showed the strongest activity. conclusions and significance: the leaves of m. micrantha may be a promising source in the search for new antimicrobial drugs due to its efficacy and the broadest range. meanwhile, adverse impact of m. micrantha will be eliminated.

TI  == skin-associated bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  == dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the nlpc/p60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. to this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16s rrna, tuf and rpob gene sequencing of nine gram-positive isolates identified them as bacillus cereus, b.  licheniformis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis and micrococcus  luteus, known human skin commensals. 16s rrna sequence homologies of four of the  nine isolates identified as b. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. all species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands  detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. in conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. the identification  of a novel cluster of b. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared d. pteronyssinus. it remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 k lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.

TI  == bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  == finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign dna. therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. here we evaluated the use of the escherichia coli-bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pht01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. this library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus luteus. a new antibacterial activity against b. cereus was found upon screening in b. subtilis. the new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase k, was not active when the corresponding dna fragment was expressed in e. coli. our  results validate the use of pht01 as a shuttle vector and b. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.

TI  == co-production of surfactin and a novel bacteriocin by bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 isolated from bikalga, an african alkaline hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment.
AB  == bikalga is a hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in burkina faso and neighboring countries. the fermentation is dominated by bacillus subtilis group species. ten b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. the bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the  agar spot assay while only gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. cell free supernatants (cfs) of pure cultures of 3 b. subtilis subsp. subtilis (g2, h4 and f1) strains inhibited growth of listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus, while cfs of 2 b. licheniformis (e3 and f9) strains only inhibited m. luteus. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by b. subtilis subsp. subtilis h4 was further characterized. the antimicrobial substance(s) produced by h4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. the activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase k and papain. treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase ii resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. the antimicrobial activity of h4 was heat resistant and active at ph3-10. pcr detection of yiwb, sboa, spox, alba  and spas, etns genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kda had antimicrobial activity. ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (uhplc-tofms) analysis of the 4kda band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59da,  which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. the complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. however, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == identification of a new bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. the purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. a new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica ser. pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as b116. this new isolate was identified as bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. the production  of bacteriocin-like substance (bls) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. the bls was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kda by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, micrococcus luteus, escherichia coli, and salmonella spp. the bls was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. activity of the bls was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. the new isolate and relevant bls are potentially useful in food and feed applications.

TI  == characterization in the archaeological excavation site of heterotrophic bacteria  and fungi of deteriorated wall painting of herculaneum in italy.
AB  == microbiological characterization of frescos in four different locations (collegio degli augustali, casa del colonnato tuscanico, casa dello scheletro and casa del  gran portale) of excavation sites of herculaneum was carried out. the use of infrared thermography allowed detecting sample points on frescos with greatest moisture not visible to the naked eye, resulting in structural damage. the microclimatic conditions provided perfect habitat for bacteria and fungi, particularly of spore forming and mould. in fact, heterotrophic bacteria were prevalent in all wall paintings monitored (ranging from 18 +/- 2 cfu 100 cm(-2) to 68 +/- 4 cfu 100 cm(-2)), whereas fungi were also detected but at lower levels (ranging from 9 +/- 2 cfu 100 cm(-2) to 45 +/- 3 cfu 100 cm(-2)). cultural-based  method allow us to identify by 16s and 26s rrna partial sequence analysis heterotrophic microorganisms belonging to different genera of bacillus and aspergillus, penicillium and fusarium together with the unusual genera as microascus and coprinus. by using this approach, bacillus-related species (b. cereus/b. thuringiensis group, b. simplex/b. muralis group, b. megaterium and b.  subtilis) were isolated in all sample points analysed with the exception of the casa dello scheletro in which micrococcus luteus/arthrobactersp. group and streptomyces fragilis were found. dgge analysis of pcr amplified v3 region of rdna from dna directly recovered from frescos samples, enabled identification of  bacterial species not identified using culturable technology asthose closest related to microbacterium group, often associated with brevibacterium, streptomyces and stenotrophomonas. combination of culture-dependent and independent methods provided better microbiology characterization of heterotrophic microbiota present on the surface of ancient frescos of this important archaeological site.

TI  == isolation and characterization of aerobic culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria from surfacewater and groundwater of rautahat district, nepal.
AB  == arsenic (as) contamination of groundwater is a serious environmental health management issue of drinking water sources especially in terai region of nepal. many studies have reported that due to natural abundance of arsenic in the environment, various bacteria have developed different resistance mechanisms for  arsenic compound. in this study, the culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria indigenous to surfacewater as well as groundwater from rautahat district of nepal were randomly isolated by standard plate count method on the basis of viable growth on plate count agar amended with arsenate ranging from 0, 0.5, 10, 40, 80  to 160 milligram per liter (mg/l). with respect to the morphological and biochemical tests, nine morphologically distinct potent arsenate tolerant bacteria showed relatedness with micrococcus varians, micrococcus roseus, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., vibrio parahaemolyticus, bacillus cereus, bacillus smithii 1 and bacillus smithii 2. the isolates were capable of tolerating more than 1000 mg/l of arsenate and 749 mg/l  of arsenite. likewise, bioaccumulation capability was highest with m. roseus (85.61%) and the least with b. smithii (47.88%) indicating the potential of the organisms in arsenic resistance and most probably in bioremediation.

TI  == in vitro antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activity studies on three agaricus species with fatty acid compositions and iron contents: a comparative study on the three most edible mushrooms.
AB  == the fatty acids of agaricus essettei, agaricus bitorquis and agaricus bisporus were investigated by using gc and gc-ms. the dominant fatty acids were found to be linoleic (61.82-67.29%) and palmitic (12.67-14.71%) acids among the 13 fatty acids detected in the oils. total unsaturation for the oils was calculated as 77.50%, 77.44%, and 79.72%, respectively. in vitro antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activities were also studied. the ethyl acetate extract of agaricus bitorquis showed the highest activity in beta-carotene-linoleic acid, dpph(.) and abts(.)(+) assays, while the hexane extract of agaricus bisporus exhibited the best metal chelating activity. the ethyl acetate and hexane extract of agaricus bitorquis and the hexane extract of  agaricus essettei showed meaningful butyrylcholinesterase activity being close to that of galantamine. the extracts were found to be effective on gram (+) bacteria, especially against micrococcus luteus, micrococcus flavus, bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus. in conclusion, agaricus bitorquis and agaricus essettei demonstrated higher iron content, and better antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activities than those of agaricus bisporus commonly consumed mushroom. hence, agaricus species, particularly agaricus bitorquis might be useful as antioxidant agents and moderate anticholinesterase agents, and their extracts will probably be used for development of dietary foods, food products and additives.

AB  == 4-benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type iia topoisomerase (dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=90 mum) but not against dna gyrase. an increase  in activity against topoisomerase iv (ic(50)=14 mum) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). however, (2) showed only  weak antibacterial activity. although the results of the bacterial type iia topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase iv. the difference in activity against type iia topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the atp binding pocket.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == antibacterial properties of grapefruit seed extract against paenibacillus larvae  subsp. larvae.
AB  == twenty-one samples of grapefruit seed extract (gse) either from marketed products or provided by an apiculturist were analysed to verify their inhibition activity, in particular against paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae, responsible for american foulbrood. the bactericide capacity of gse has been measured in bacillus subtilis bga, bacillus cereus 11778, bacillus cereus k250 and micrococcus luteus  9341a; these bacteria are normally used in the laboratory to study inhibitors. the results showed that not all gse have the same inhibitory activity and two of  those analysed do not inhibit the five bacteria used. considering that 19 samples inhibited american foulbrood bacillus, the authors conclude that the use of a natural product (such as gse) to control this important disease of bees, can be used as a substitute for chemotherapeutic products, after appropriate expedients.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. in this study, chemically  synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many gram-positive bacteria but not gram-negative  bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was observed. however, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. the interaction of tick defensin with  the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential  over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. transmission electron microscopy of micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. these findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. in addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.

TI  == development of a rapid 1-h fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay for listeria species.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes is cytotoxic to the lymphocyte-origin hybridoma ped-2e9 cell line. the relative cytotoxicity can be calculated by assaying the release of alkaline phosphatase (alp) from the infected cell line. in this study, a fluorogenic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, mup) was used to quantify  the alp activity. the assay is 3.5-fold more sensitive than the colorimetric-based assay and requires only 1 h to differentiate virulent from avirulent strains. in addition to various listeria species, 27 different common foodborne or clinical microorganisms were tested with the fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and only six cultures (bacillus cereus, citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, pseudomonas putida, corynebacterium glutamicum and micrococcus luteus) showed cytotoxic effects similar to l. monocytogenes. to use  this assay as a confirmatory test for virulent l. monocytogenes suspect strains,  pure cultures must be isolated from the sample prior to testing.

TI  == [comparative study of the elemental composition of vegetative and dormant microbial cells].
AB  == x-ray microanalysis showed that vegetative cells, viable resting forms, and nonviable forms (micromummies) of the bacteria bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae differ in the contents of bioelements s, p, ca, and k and the ca/k and p/s ratios. viable resting forms (cystlike refractory cells and bacillar endospores) had more calcium and less phosphorus and potassium than vegetative cells, the difference being higher for bacilli than for micrococci and yeasts. the distinctive feature of all viable resting microbial forms was their low p/s ratios and high ca/k ratios. the differences revealed in the cellular content and ratios of bioelements probably reflect changes in ionic homeostasis accompanying the transition of vegetative microbial cells to the dormant state. relevant potassium parameters indicate that the membranes of viable resting forms retain their barrier function. at the same  time, the nonviable forms, even morphologically intact, of b. cereus and s. cerevisiae exhibited an anomalously low content of potassium, while those of m. luteus had an anomalously high content of this element. this suggests that the cellular membranes of micromummies lose their barrier function, which results in  a free diffusion of potassium ions across the membranes. the possibility of using the elemental composition parameters for quick analysis of the physiological state of microorganisms in natural environments is discussed.

AB  == non-spore-forming bacteria of the genera arthrobacter and micrococcus, isolated from permafrost subsoil, were found to produce greater amounts of the d1 extracellular factor than closely related collection strains isolated from soil.  the effect of this factor, responsible for cell transition to anabiosis, was not  species-specific. thus, the d1 crude preparation isolated from the culture liquid of the permafrost isolate arthrobacter globiformis 245 produced an effect on the  collection strain arthrobacter globiformis b-1112 and also on micrococcus luteus  and bacillus cereus. the crude d1 preparation from the permafrost isolate of arthrobacter differed from the chemical analogue of this factor, 4n-hexylresorcinol, in the level of the induced cell response, which may have resulted from different cell sensitivity to various homologs of alkylhydroxybenzenes contained in the d1 preparation. thus, additional evidence was obtained indicating that autoregulation of bacterial growth and development is implemented at the level of intercellular interactions in microbial communities. abundant production of the d1 anabiosis-inducing factors by bacteria isolated from permafrost subsoil is probably a result of special antistress mechanisms responsible for the survival of these bacteria under extreme conditions of natural deep cooling.

TI  == inhibition tests for detection and presumptive identification of tetracyclines, beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in poultry meat.
AB  == a combination of three plates, seeded with strains of micrococcus luteus, bacillus cereus or escherichia coli, can be used for detection of residues of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. the sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (lod) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (mrl) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin g, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with m. luteus. tetracyclines are detected up to the mrl level with b.  cereus, and fluoroquinolones with e. coli. the lods of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin g (peng) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (ampi) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (amox) 1.0 ng on the plate with m. luteus; tetracycline (tet) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (oxy) 3 ng, doxycycline (dox) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (chl) 0.3 ng on the plate with b. cereus; enrofloxacin (enrx) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (cipx) 0.5 ng and flumequine (flum) 1.5 ng on the plate with e. coli. the combination of plates enables the laboratory to select appropriate chromatographic techniques for identification and quantification of the residues. on the other hand, the three groups can also be detected on one plate seeded with bacillus subtilis, although the limits of detection are higher: peng 0.4 ng, ampi and amox 3 ng, tet 5 ng, oxy 8 ng, dox 1 ng, chl 0.5 ng, enrx 4 ng, cipx 10 ng and flum 4 ng. the test was applied to 228 broiler fillets and to 27 turkey thighs, originating from different poultry slaughterhouses. nineteen broiler fillets contained inhibiting substances. the positive results of the inhibition tests were confirmed with a chromatographic technique. doxycycline residues were  found in 16 samples and amoxicillin in two.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == identification and semiquantitative estimation of antibiotics added to complete feeds, premixes, and concentrates.
AB  == classical microbiological methods for determining antimicrobial compounds in feeds are nonspecific. thus, there is a need to identify biological activity, and bioautography is used for this purpose. a routine method for detecting the following antimicrobial substances in feeds is described: avilamycin, avoparcin,  zn-bacitracin, erythromycin, flavomycin, furazolidone, lasalocid, monensin, narasin, penicillin, salinomycin, spiramycin, tetracyclines, tylosin, and virginiamycin. carbadox can be detected by uv light examination of the plates prior to bioautography. semiquantitative estimations of antibiotic content are compared with quantitative determinations of the above mentioned substances in feeds, except erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracyclines. detection limits range from 0.1 mg/kg (chlortetracycline) to 20 mg/kg (lasalocid). the method involves agar diffusion of buffered samples, a neutral extraction of polyether antibiotics followed by thin-layer chromatography (tlc), and an acid extraction for other antibiotics followed by tlc. five test bacteria were used for the main detection  by agar diffusion: micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538p, corynebacterium xerosis nctc 9755, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, and b. subtilis atcc 6633. identification after tlc was achieved by bioautography with the most sensitive microorganism(s). this method allows one laboratory technician to analyze up to 30 feed samples within 2.5 working days, provided that feeds of  the same category are analyzed in the same run, and that labels of additives are  available. qualitative and semiquantitative information are valuable when performing a quantitative antibiotic determination and it provides proof that the activity determined is due to the tested substance. this last feature is essential from the perspective of quality assurance of results.

TI  == [formation of a resting form of bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus].
AB  == under certain cultivation conditions, the bacteria bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus form cystlike refractive cells (up to 60% of the total number) that retain viability over a long time, are metabolically inactive and thermotolerant and possess specific ultrastructure. these properties allow them to be attributed to a new type of resting forms of microorganisms.

TI  == a rapid method to quantify bacterial contamination on hatching eggs. 1. correlation of optical density with initial bacterial count.
AB  == the use of optical-density (od) readings after a 6-h incubation period, as a suitable method to quantify the bacterial contamination on hatching eggs, was established by the use of pure cultures of five bacterial isolates found to be the most prevalent on the hatching eggs examined. these isolates were identified  as micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus gallinarum, streptococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas cepacei and bacillus cereus. it was established that the od reading was repeatable when the same inoculum was used to inoculate five different cultures, which were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees c. this repeatability was not affected by bacterial isolate, or bacterial concentration of the inoculum, or when mixed bacterial cultures were used. a direct relationship was established between the od reading (at 540 nm) after 6 h and the log of the bacterial concentration at the start of incubation. the od reading after 6 h of incubation  is a repeatable, rapid and simple method to quantify the bacterial concentration  at the start of the incubation period.

AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == periodic acid-schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection. case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-schiff staining  properties of bacteria.
AB  == primary cutaneous bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient. in lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of b cereus may be mistaken for clostridium species. this is a potentially serious error, as bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. we studied a case in which large periodic acid-schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic  patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. the tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of b cereus. staining with periodic acid-schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. the following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-schiff positive after diastase digestion: b cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, propionibacterium acnes, klebsiella pneumoniae, and micrococcus luteus.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == [antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin g10x].
AB  == data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin g10x, a preparation of lytic enzymes from bacillus subtilis sk-52 are presented. lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. when it was used as a  substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in b. brevis, b. cereus, b. pumilis, b. subtilis and s. faecalis. preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. sometimes the increase was very high (b. sphaericus, b. subtilis 720, e. coli k12 and mre-600). such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (b. cereus 1312, c. renale, m. luteus, s. aureus kp, 800, 805 and 126001, s. pyogenes 291). an increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. however, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with  its 10 times higher doses. an increase in the lysis level was also achieved with  increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. its use in veterinary was a success.

AB  == the methyl moiety of ribothymidine in the trna of streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and probably bacillus cereus is dervied from a 1-carbon folate derivative and not s-adenosylmethionine. micrococcus luteus (m. lysodeikticus) trna appears to be almost devoid of ribothymidine. s. faecalis trna lacking ribothymidine can be methylated in vitro with formation of ribothymidine. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate has been identified as the 1-carbon donor involved in ribothymidine formation in s. faecalis and implicated in the analogous reaction in b. subtilis. the reaction requires fadh2 and/or another reducing agent present in cell extracts for the reduction of the methylene moiety.
