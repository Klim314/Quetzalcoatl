TI  == rna degradation in archaea and gram-negative bacteria different from escherichia  coli.
AB  == exoribonucleolytic and endoribonucleolytic activities are important for controlled degradation of rna and contribute to the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by influencing the half-lives of specific messenger rnas. the rna half-lives are determined by the characteristics of the rna substrates and by the availability and the properties of the involved proteins-ribonucleases and assisting polypeptides. much is known about rna degradation in eukarya and bacteria, but there is limited information about rna-degrading enzymes and rna destabilizing or stabilizing elements in the domain of the archaea. the recent progress in the understanding of the structure and function of the archaeal exosome, a protein complex with rna-degrading and rna-tailing capabilities, has given some first insights into the mechanisms of rna degradation in the third domain of life and into the evolution of rna-degrading enzymes. moreover, other archaeal rnases with degrading potential have been described and a new mechanism for protection of the 5'-end of rna in archaea was discovered. here, we summarize the current knowledge on rna degradation in the archaea. additionally, rna degradation mechanisms in rhodobacter capsulatus and pseudomonas syringae are compared to those in the major model organism for gram-negatives, escherichia coli, which dominates our view on rna degradation in bacteria.

TI  == exoribonuclease r interacts with endoribonuclease e and an rna helicase in the psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w.
AB  == endoribonuclease e, a key enzyme involved in rna decay and processing in bacteria, organizes a protein complex called degradosome. in escherichia coli, rhodobacter capsulatus, and streptomyces coelicolor, rnase e interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, dead-box helicase(s), and additional factors in an rna-degrading complex. to characterize  the degradosome of the psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w, rnase  e was enriched by cation exchange chromatography and fractionation in a glycerol  density gradient. most surprisingly, the hydrolytic exoribonuclease rnase r was found to co-purify with rnase e. co-immunoprecipitation and ni(2+)-affinity pull-down experiments confirmed the specific interaction between rnase r and rnase e. additionally, the dead-box helicase rhle was identified as part of this  protein complex. fractions comprising the three proteins showed rnase e and rnase r activity and efficiently degraded a synthetic stem-loop containing rna in the presence of atp. the unexpected association of rnase r with rnase e and rhle in an rna-degrading complex indicates that the cold-adapted p. syringae has a degradosome of novel structure. the identification of rnase r instead of polynucleotide phosphorylase in this complex underlines the importance of the interaction between endo- and exoribonucleases for the bacterial rna metabolism.  the physical association of rnase e with an exoribonuclease and an rna helicase apparently is a common theme in the composition of bacterial rna-degrading complexes.
