TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == properties and construction of plasmid pfw213, a shuttle vector with the oral streptococcus origin of replication.
AB  == streptococcus parasanguinis is among the most successful colonizers of the human  body. strain fw213 harbors a 7.0-kb cryptic plasmid, pfw213, with a copy number at 5 to 10 per chromosome. sequence and functional analyses of pfw213 revealed that the open reading frame (orf) encoding the replication protein (rep) is essential for the replication of pfw213, and the putative plasmid addiction system (relb and rele) and an orf (orf6) with no known function are required for  its stability. the minimal replicon of pfw213 contains the rep gene and its 5'-flanking 390-bp region. within the minimal replicon, an a/t-rich region followed by 5 contiguous 22-bp repeats was located 5' of the atg of rep. no single-stranded replication intermediates were detected in the derivatives of pfw213, suggesting that pfw213 replicates via the theta replication mechanism. the minimal replicon was unstable in streptococcal hosts without selection, but the stability was greatly enhanced in derivatives containing the intact relbe genes. a streptococcus-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pcg1, was constructed with the pfw213 replicon. plasmid pcg1 features a multiple cloning region and a spectinomycin resistance determinant that is expressed in both streptococcus spp. and e. coli. various streptococcal dna fragments were cloned in pcg1, and the recombinant constructs were stably maintained in the streptococcal hosts. since pcg1 is compatible with the most widely used streptococcal replicon, pva380-1, pcg1 will provide a much needed tool allowing the cloning of two genes that work  in concert in the same host.

TI  == a novel glucosyltransferase is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich adhesin and biofilm formation by streptococcus parasanguinis.
AB  == fap1-like serine-rich glycoproteins are conserved in streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli, and are required for bacterial biofilm formation and pathogenesis. glycosylation of fap1 is mediated by a gene cluster flanking the fap1 locus. the key enzymes responsible for the first step of fap1 glycosylation  are glycosyltransferases gtf1 and gtf2. they form a functional enzyme complex that catalyzes the transfer of n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) residues to the fap1  polypeptide. however, until now nothing was known about the subsequent step in fap1 glycosylation. here, we show that the second step in fap1 glycosylation is catalyzed by nucleotide-sugar synthetase-like (nss) protein. the nss gene located upstream of fap1 is also highly conserved in streptococci and lactobacilli. nss-deficient mutants failed to catalyze the second step of fap1 glycosylation in vivo in streptococcus parasanguinis and in a recombinant fap1 glycosylation system. nss catalyzed the direct transfer of the glucosyl residue to the glcnac-modified fap1 substrate in vitro, demonstrating that nss is a glucosyltransferase. thus we renamed nss as glucosyltransferase 3 (gtf3). a gtf3  mutant exhibited a biofilm defect. taken together, we conclude that this new glucosyltransferase mediates the second step of fap1 glycosylation and is required for biofilm formation.

TI  == the utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  == there is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. in this study, we utilized an e. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pvt1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pvpt-ctag  and pvpt-ntag, with each set containing five affinity tags (gst, gfp, hsv, t7 and nano) that can be fused to either the c- or n-terminus of a target protein. a putative glycosyltransferase (gtf2) essential for fap1 glycosylation was used to  demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain streptococcus  parasanguinis. gfp and t7 tags were readily expressed in s. parasanguinis as either an n- or c-terminal fusion to gtf2. only the c- terminal fusion of gst and hsv were able to be identified in s. parasanguinis. the nano tag was not detected in either e. coli or s. parasanguinis. genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the nano-tagged gtf2 at its n-terminal fusion. using a t7-tagged gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion  cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including s. mutans, s. pneumoniae and s. sanguinis. therefore, the  expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in fap1 biogenesis in s. parasanguinis, but also to  study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pvt1666 replicates.

TI  == interaction between two putative glycosyltransferases is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich streptococcal adhesin.
AB  == fap1, a serine-rich glycoprotein, is essential for fimbrial biogenesis and biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis (formerly s. parasanguis). fap1-like proteins are conserved in many streptococci and staphylococci and have  been implicated in bacterial virulence. fap1 contains two serine-rich repeat regions that are modified by o-linked glycosylation. a seven-gene cluster has been identified, and this cluster is implicated in fap1 biogenesis. in this study, we investigated the initial step of fap1 glycosylation by using a recombinant fap1 as a model. this recombinant molecule has the same monosaccharide composition profile as the native fap1 protein. glycosyl linkage analyses indicated that n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) is among the first group of  sugar residues transferred to the fap1 peptide. two putative glycosyltransferases, gtf1 and gtf2, were essential for the glycosylation of fap1 with glcnac-containing oligosaccharide(s) in both s. parasanguinis as well as in  the fap1 glycosylation system in escherichia coli. yeast two-hybrid analysis as well as in vitro and in vivo glutathione s-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the two putative glycosyltransferases interacted with each other. the interaction domain was mapped to an n-terminal region of gtf1 that was required for the fap1 glycosylation. the data in this study suggested that the formation of the gtf1 and gtf2 complex was required for the initiation of the fap1 glycosylation and that the n-terminal region of gtf1 was necessary.
