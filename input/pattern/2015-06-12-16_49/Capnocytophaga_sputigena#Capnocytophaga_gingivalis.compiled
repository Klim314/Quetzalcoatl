TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.
TI  - Phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  - The effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. Eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. Light with a power density of 70 mW/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. Dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. Microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard DNA probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. The proportions of black-pigmented species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. Five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. These species were Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena. At the same time, the percentage of gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. No adverse effects were found or reported in this study. The present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - High prevalence of beta-lactam and macrolide resistance genes in human oral Capnocytophaga species.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance determinants in the Capnocytophaga genus and to describe the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance genes in human oral Capnocytophaga species. METHODS: Forty-eight Capnocytophaga isolates identified by analysis of 16S rRNA sequences were isolated from subgingival samples from 14 haematology patients (HPs), 11 periodontitis patients (PPs) and 17 healthy volunteers (HVs). MICs of beta-lactam and MLS antibiotics were obtained for all isolates. blaCfxA, blaCSP-1 (encoding a new class A beta-lactamase) and MLS resistance genes [erm(F), erm(B), erm(Q), erm(D), erm(C) and erm(A)] were evaluated using specific PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: In HVs, which had the lowest prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing isolates in comparison with the other groups (16%; P < 0.001), Capnocytophaga ochracea was the prominent species (68%; P < 0.03). In PPs, which had a high prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive isolates (82%; P < 0.001), Capnocytophaga sputigena was more frequently identified (64%; P < 0.03). In HPs, 50% of isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. The more rarely identified species (15%) Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga granulosa and Capnocytophaga leadbetteri were isolated only from PPs and/or HPs. All beta-lactam-resistant isolates (44%) were PCR-positive for blaCfxA (31%) or blaCSP-1 (12.5%). Interestingly, blaCSP-1 was identified only in a subgroup of the C. sputigena species. Twenty-nine percent of isolates were MLS resistant independently of species identification, beta-lactamase production or patient group. The MLS-resistant isolates carried the erm(F) or erm(C) gene (93% and 7%, respectively), previously unknown in the Capnocytophaga genus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that Capnocytophaga species are important contributors to the beta-lactam and MLS resistance gene reservoir in the oral microbiome.
TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. DESIGN: Dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in Okayama, Japan, in 2011. Bacterial DNA was extracted from each specimen and PCR analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas gulae, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were performed. RESULTS: P. gulae (71.2%), T. forsythia (77.3%), and C. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. P. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. Furthermore, E. corrodens and T. denticola in specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in Japan.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. The distribution of an animal gingival organism Porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. Porphyromonas gulae, Tannerella forsythia and Campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. Then, isolation and identification of the Porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. There were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were Porphyromonas gulae. In contrast, the frequency of Porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. These findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially Porphyromonas gulae.
TI  - Early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. However, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately after professional cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of DNA probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. RESULTS: Succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. At 1 d, Streptococcus mitis and Neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. At 4-7 d, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella nigrescens became elevated. Subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. Increased proportions were first observed for S. mitis, followed by V. parvula and C. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by Capnocytophaga sputigena and P. nigrescens. No significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. CONCLUSION: There is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.
TI  - Evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. METHODS: The study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the Philippe Pinel Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the CAGE (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (WHO). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (PD) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with PD < 4 mm. The presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed using the checkerboard technique. RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. However, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). Moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, F. nuc. nucleatum, Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, P. gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Tannerella forsythia at sites with PD < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). Of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented significantly higher mean levels of F. nuc. vincentii, F. nuc nucleatum, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythia than sites with PD >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.
TI  - IL6 -174 genotype associated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in Indians.
AB  - AIM: Genetic factors have recently been associated with presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans subgingivally in populations living in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to analyse associations between Interleukin-6 (IL6) single nucleotide polymorphisms and presence and levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans and other subgingival microbes in a rural Indian population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 251 individuals from a rural village in India with a periodontal phenotype ranging from healthy to severe periodontitis were included. Checkerboard DNA-DNA analysis was performed to detect 40 periodontal taxa in subgingival plaque samples. Genomic DNA was extracted to genotype five polymorphisms in the IL6 promoter region. RESULTS: The IL6-74 GG genotype was associated with high (above median) counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans (both in all subjects and in periodontally healthy only) and with presence and counts of Capnocytophaga sputigena. Differences in detection of several other bacteria were noted between periodontitis and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the influence of genetic factors on the subgingival microbiota.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in Japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. Accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. We investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. METHODS: A total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. Subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. Bacterial DNA was extracted from the specimens and PCR analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. In addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. RESULTS: The most frequently detected species was Capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and Campylobacter rectus (18.2%). Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and Porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. The total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. There were 10 subjects with positive reactions for T. denticola and/or T. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. Furthermore, subjects possessing C. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of species. CONCLUSION: We found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of T. denticola, T. forsythia, and C. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. Follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - Infection at titanium implants with or without a clinical diagnosis of inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the microbiota at implants diagnosed with peri-implantitis, implant mucositis, or being clinically healthy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and microbiological data were collected from 213 subjects (mean age: 65.7+/-14) with 976 implants in function (mean: 10.8 years, SD+/-1.5). Forty species were identified by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Implant mean % plaque score was 41.8+/-32.4%. Periodontitis defined by bone loss was found in 44.9% of subjects. Implant mucositis was diagnosed in 59% and peri-implantitis in 14.9% of all cases. Neisseria mucosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, F. nucleatum sp. polymorphum, and Capnocytophaga sputigena dominated the implant sub-mucosal microbiota and the sub-gingival microbiota at tooth sites. Implant probing pocket depth at the implant site with the deepest probing depth was correlated with levels of Eikenella corrodens (r=0.16, P<0.05), the levels of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (r=0.15, P<0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (r=0.14, P<0.05), and Micromonas micros (r=0.17, P=0.01). E. corrodens was found in higher levels at implants with mucositis compared with implant health (P<0.05). Subjects who lost teeth due to periodontitis had higher yields of F. nucleatum sp. vincentii (P<0.02) and N. mucosa (P<0.05). Independent of implant status subjects with teeth had higher levels of P. gingivalis (P<0.05), and Leptotrichia buccalis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: At implant sites studied, few bacteria differed by whether subjects were dentate or not or by implant status.
TI  - Distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from Japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species known as the red complex (P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and T. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. METHODS: One hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were randomly selected from patients treated at the Pedodontic Clinic of Osaka University Dental Hospital. Saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. Genomic DNA was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans was the most frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by C. sputigena, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythensis, while C. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. denticola in the children. The detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.
TI  - Rate of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Although microbiological studies have identified more than 400 bacterial species  in periodontal pockets, only a limited number have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of cultivable subgingival periodontopathogenic bacteria in chronic periodontitis. Bacterial samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets ((5 mm) of 203 patients: 92 males and 111 females, aged 35-55 years. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and capnophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and a commercial rapid test system. The isolates were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (26.8%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (21.9%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (16.7%), Eikenella corrodens (13.2%), Prevotella intermedia (10.5 %), Prevotella disiens (3.1%), Peptostreptococcus micros (2.9%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (2.2%), Prevotella corporis (1.8%), Peptostreptococcus magnus (1.3%) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (0.4%). No periodontopathogenic bacterial growth was observed in 14 of the samples (6.2%). The number of samples associated with monobacterial growth and polybacterial growth were 74.9% and 18.2% respectively. It is concluded that the bacterial composition associated with a number of patients' samples is quite complex, and that some of cultivable anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria act as periodontal pathogens in chronic periodontitis.
TI  - Occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. METHODS: Ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. P. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. Eikenella corrodens and Campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while Tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, P. nigrescens, C. rectus, and E. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial flora of healthy children, whereas P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. denticola appear to be transient organisms.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - [In vitro sensitivity of oral gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal activity of defensins].
AB  - Oral gram-negative bacteria, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Provotella intermedius, Provotella melaninogenicus, have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. An ultrasensitive antibacterial assay was applied to determine the sensitivity of a battery of oral gram-negative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated human neutrophil defensins (HNP) and two kinds of rabbit defensins NP1 and NP2. All species tested were killed by HNP, NP1 and NP2 except that porphyromonas gingivalis was resistant to HNP. However, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. It was concluded that the oral gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensinmediated bacterial killing.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. We assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. METHODS: Plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. Using species-specific primers of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola, PCR amplification was performed with bacterial genomic DNA from plaque samples. RESULTS: The results indicated that C. rectus, E. corrodens, A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, and C. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while B. forsythus and P. intermedia were detected less frequently, and P. gingivalis and T. denticola were not found. In contrast, the percentage of P. nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. Subject-based analyses suggested that the number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. However, colonization by P. gingivalis and T. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.
TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. In this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN, Kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (CN). METHODS: The SCN patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with CN had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. Monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. Oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. Under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. RESULTS: By a PCR-based method, Prevotella nigrescens, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the SCN patient and P. intermedia, C. rectus, C. gingivalis, and C. sputigena in the CN patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and C. ochracea were not found in either patient. CONCLUSIONS: Use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.
TI  - Capnocytophaga granulosa and Capnocytophaga haemolytica: novel species in subgingival plaque.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral cavity accommodates one of the most diverse microfloras in the human body. Knowledge of this microflora, and of the periodontal microflora in particular, proves crucial towards an understanding of the bacterial-host interactions which lead to the development of infectious inflammatory periodontal diseases. Capnocytophaga species have been implicated as putative periodontal pathogens. To date, only 3 members of this genus (C. gingivalis, C. ochracea and C. sputigena) have been isolated from subgingival plaque. AIM: This communication reports the isolation of 2 recently-speciated strains, namely C. granulosa and C. haemolytica, from subgingival plaque collected from adult periodontitis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque was collected from 29 patients with chronic adult periodontitis. Plaque samples were inoculated onto fastidious anaerobe agar and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. Routine identification of clinical isolates was performed by 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP analysis, using Cfo I as restriction enzyme and corroborated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: 16 of 29 patients (55%) tested positive for either C. granulosa and or C. haemolytica. A total of 70 isolates (63 C. granulosa and 7 C. haemolytica) were cultivated from subgingival plaque. 15 (51%) patients tested positive for C. granulosa, and 3 (10%) patients tested positive for C. haemolytica. CONCLUSION: This is the 1st report which recounts the presence of C. granulosa and C. haemolytica in subgingival plaque. Further research is required to establish the relative proportions of these species subgingivally in health and disease.
TI  - Relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in Down's syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Down's syndrome (DS) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of DS periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 DS young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (MD). The prevalence of 10 possible periodontopathic bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. The detection of P. gingivalis fimA genotypes was also performed in P. gingivalis-positive samples. RESULTS: Although DS subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with MD, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. The profiles of subjects with periodontitis were significant in DS, but not in MD. The prevalence of P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, and P. intermedia were significant in the DS periodontitis group, compared to DS gingivitis group. Moreover, the occurrence of P. gingivalis with the type II fimA gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both DS and MD, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in DS is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including P. gingivalis with type II fimA.
TI  - PCR detection of Capnocytophaga species in dental plaque samples from children aged 2 to 12 years.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of Capnocytophaga sputigena, C. ochracea, and C. gingivalis in plaque samples from the toothbrushes of 122 children, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The subjects were 25, 85, and 12 children with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, ranging in age from 2-12 years old. Plaque samples were collected from all erupted tooth sites using a sterile toothbrush. The mean amount of DNA recovered from the samples was approximately 19.3 microg, which was deemed sufficient for performing a PCR-based survey. C. sputigena prevalence in healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis subjects was 48.0%, 36.5% and 25.0%, respectively, that for C. ochracea was 100%, 89.4%, and 50.0%, respectively, and that for C. gingivalis was 96.0%, 84.7%, and 75.0%, respectively. The lowest age of positive subjects was approximately 2 years. Our results showed that C. sputigena was moderately prevalent, whereas C. ochracea and C. gingivalis were commonly detected in the oral cavities of the tested children, suggesting that all of these species become established in the early years.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacteria in children with Down syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely known that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. In this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in DS children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. METHODS: The subjects were 60 DS children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls. Ten pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, P nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, Campyrobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. RESULTS: No significant difference in periodontal status was observed between the DS and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the DS children. B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. nigrescens, and C. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the DS children (P <0.01 or 0.05). The occurrence of P. gingivalis was also significant in the DS subjects over 5 years old. A cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the DS subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of DS patients and maturation of subgingival components, including P. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.
TI  - Flow cytometry to monitor phagocytosis and oxidative burst of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - The reduced susceptibility to phagocytosis found among some periodontopathogenic  anaerobes may account for the differences between invasive and non-invasive strains. We applied flow cytometry as a powerful tool to analyze and quantify phagocytosis using standardized cultures of oral anaerobes (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, P. nigrescens, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus micros) and heparinized whole blood. Bacteria were labeled by a fluorescein-methylester and their esterase activity, resulting in green fluorescence. Ingested bacteria could be detected easily and quantified by a shift towards green fluorescence in the PMNL population involved and a concomitant decrease in the bacterial population. Furthermore, the oxidative burst of PMNLs was detected in parallel assays using the dye DHR123 which becomes fluorescent upon oxidation during the oxidative burst process. We found a great diversity in phagocytosis susceptibility determined by estimating the portion of phagocytosing PMNLs, ranging from 10.6% (strain W83) to > 99.4% (e.g. ATCC 33277T) in P. gingivalis and from 15.9% (strain MH5) to > 95% (ATCC 33563T) in P. nigrescens. In contrast, almost all P. intermedia strains as well as the representatives of the other anaerobic, putative periodontopathic species tested showed no or only moderate resistance in the phagocytosis assay. Comparison of clinical data of patients and the extent of phagocytosis resistance of the corresponding P. gingivalis strains suggests that this virulence factor may contribute to the clinical outcome.
TI  - Subgingival microflora and treatment in prepubertal periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia.
AB  - Prepubertal periodontitis affects both primary and permanent dentition. The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival microflora of the permanent dentition in an 11-year-old Caucasian female, who had premature exfoliation of her deciduous teeth on her 5th year of age, and the response of this condition to the antibiotic therapy and supportive periodontal care. Gingival tissues were highly inflamed and alveolar bone loss was detected radiographically. The girl had experienced frequent upper respiratory tract infections, tonsilitis and recurrent otitis media. Her mother had history of early onset periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. Blood chemistry tests and immunological examinations were also performed. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from the proximal sites of permanent molars, incisors, canines and maxillary premolars. 27 different microbial species were isolated from the subgingival microflora. Among the predominant species were Porphyromonas gingivalis (17.6%-7.3%), Prevotella intermedia (12.4%-4.7%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (14.4%-10.4%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (13.2%-6.9%) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.3%-5.5%). Periodontal treatment consisted of scaling, root planing in conjunction with antibiotic administration of Augmentin 312.5 mg and Flagyl 200 mg, each t.i.d. for 10 days. 3 weeks after the antibiotic therapy, bacterial samples were collected from the same sites. All the periodontal pathogens were recovered in lower levels and A.actinomycetemcomitans was almost eliminated in the 3-week period. The evaluation of clinical indices at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that periodontal treatment in conjunction with antibiotics was effective and rapidly followed by marked clinical improvement. The microbiological monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after antibiotic treatment and each time prior to supportive periodontal care, revealed that the periodontal pathogens fluctuated in low levels even 12 months after treatment and could be maintained at low level by supportive periodontal care at 3-month intervals.
TI  - Subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Age was inversely associated with the GO. Plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with GO, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of GO. The gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the GO. Statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of GO were detected for Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium and Selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. Significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species Eubacterium alactolyticum, Campylobacter concisus, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, F. mortiferum, F. nucleatum, and F. varium from the more enlarged lesions (GO >3).
TI  - Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-HCl.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-HCl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease in bacterial susceptibility. Twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. After subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-HCl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. The lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. The distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of minocycline-HCl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-HCl concentration equal to or less than the MIC for reference strains. However, some clinical strains of Prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. There were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. The concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.
TI  - HLA-D types and serum IgG responses to Capnocytophaga in diabetes and periodontitis.
AB  - Serum IgG responses to the cell envelope proteins (CEPs) from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were examined in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects, both with and without type 1 diabetes (n = 60). Serum IgG responses to CEPs were determined by immunoblotting with biotin-goat anti-human IgG and an alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin system. Reactivity was analyzed by transmission densitometry, digitization, and computer manipulation. The patients with diabetes showed significantly (p < 0.01) fewer responses to 14 CEPs (from 81 to 10 kDa) from C. sputigena, 5 CEPs (from 90 to 17 kDa) from C. gingivalis, and the 27-kDa CEP from C. ochracea than in the non-diabetic group. The periodontitis patients showed significantly (p < 0.01) fewer responses to the 25- and 11-kDa CEPs from C. sputigena, the 125- and 17-kDa CEPs from C. gingivalis, and the 42-kDa CEP from C. ochracea than in the periodontally healthy group. HLA-DR4, HLA-DR53, and HLA-DQw3 were associated with periodontitis, while only HLA-DR4 was associated with diabetes (p < 0.02). Significant (p < 0.01) correlations were found between HLA-DR2 and IgG reactivity patterns associated with non-diabetics, and between HLA-DR4 and IgG reactivity patterns associated with diabetic and periodontitis subjects. These results indicate that both type 1 diabetics and periodontitis subjects have a depressed IgG antibody profile to Capnocytophaga, which may account for an increased susceptibility to periodontitis infection. Periodontitis in type 1 diabetes may be related more to the HLA-D type and altered immune function than to the diabetes itself.
TI  - Characterization of protease activities in Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema denticola and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. Capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. The elastase-like activity was strongest in Capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others were greatest in Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. Porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. Prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to P. gingivalis. Treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  - The degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. Fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. The degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by Capnocytophaga ochracea, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter sputorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus and Peptostreptococcus micros. All strains of P. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. The degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin C and albumin. The degradation by C. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. Furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. The present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. The presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.
TI  - PCR reaction and dot-blot hybridization to monitor the distribution of oral pathogens within plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of the putative periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, the three oral Capnocytophaga species (C. ochracea, C. sputigena, C. gingivalis), as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals. We chose a newly developed 16S rDNA directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a previously described dot-blot hybridization assay to detect, differentiate, and quantify these bacteria directly in clinical samples. The subjects of these investigations were 66 sulcus fluid samples from 17 children (ages 3 to 5) attending a kindergarten, 48 sulcus fluid samples from 12 children (ages 9 and 10) from a primary school, and 25 subgingival plaque samples isolated from 6 different periodontally healthy dental students (ages 24 to 27). We were able to demonstrate the presence of P. nigrescens in 54 (kindergarten: 5; primary school: 33; students: 16) samples by PCR and quantified it by dot-blot hybridization. In addition, we found C. ochracea in 12 (kindergarten: 2; primary school: 10) samples by PCR reaction only. The other tested bacterial species were absent by the methods used. Furthermore we confirmed the specificity of our P. nigrescens-PCR in selected samples by enzyme electrophoresis.
TI  - Differentiation of human Capnocytophaga species by multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis and serotyping of immunoglobulin A1 proteases.
AB  - As part of a larger taxonomic investigation of the genus Capnocytophaga, 50 strains, including reference strains as well as clinical isolates, were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic (MLEE) analysis of 12 intracellular metabolic enzymes and characterization of their immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases by enzyme-neutralizing antibodies raised in rabbits. The dendrogram derived from cluster analysis of the MLEE data discriminated between the five known human Capnocytophaga species and separated the strains into two major divisions. Division A comprised C. gingivalis and C. granulosa strains, and division B comprised C. ochracea, C. sputigena and C. haemolytica strains. Immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) protease activity, a known feature of C. ochracea, C. sputigena and C. gingivalis, was present in all strains except the type strain of C. haemolytica and two clinical isolates. Inhibition typing of IgA1 proteases of all active strains with enzyme-neutralizing antibodies against protease preparations of the type strains of C. ochracea, C. sputigena and C. gingivalis separated the strains into two major groups identical to the two divisions based on the MLEE data. Thus, the IgA1 proteases of C. granulosa and C. gingivalis seemed to be antigenically similar to one another, and different from the IgA1 proteases of C. ochracea and C. sputigena, which had similar characteristics. The clustering of the clinical isolates based on the MLEE analyses, which was confirmed by the antigenic characterization of IgA1 proteases, was in good agreement with the results of previous studies.
TI  - [Subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontic patients and susceptibility of these bacteria to minocycline-HCl].
AB  - The present study was carried out to examine the distribution of six periodontopathic bacteria in deep periodontal pockets and to reconfirm the effect of Periocline on these periodontopathic bacteria. Samples from sixty-two periodontal pockets were collected at pocket depths of over 4 mm in twenty-one periodontitis patients aged 43 to 75 years. After sampling, Periocline was applied topically to the selected pockets once a week for four weeks and reexamined. The detected rates of the periodontopathic bacteria were Capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), Prevotella intermedia (22.6%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%) and Eikenella corrodens (4.8%). The distribution of the bacteria was compound because two or three bacterial species were found to coexist. In view of the MIC of minocycline-HCI for these bacteria, increase of most of the measured bacteria was suppressed by the concentration of drugs, including Periocline. However, clinical strains of P. i. were considered to have low susceptibility to minocycline-HCl. In view of the effect of topical application of drugs, no significant differences were found. From these results, it was suggested that Periocline contained effective concentration of minocycline-HCl.
TI  - [Identification of Capnocytophaga species by microplate hybridization method, and its restriction endonuclease digestion patterns].
AB  - Because differentiation of Capnocytophaga on a species level has been reportedly  proved impossible, we used a microplate hybridization method to identify three Capnocytophaga species. Photobiotin labeled DNAs from clinical isolates were added to the wells of a microdilution plate in which reference DNA had been immobilized. After 2 h of hybridization at 40 degrees C, hybridized DNAs were quantitatively detected with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and the substrate, tetramethylbenzidine. Of the 22 strains of Capnocytophaga species, 6 strains were identified as C. sputigena, 8 strains as C. gingivalis, and 8 strains as C. ochracea. Genomic DNAs from 25 strains of Capnocytophaga were treated with restriction endonuclease of HindIII, HaeIII, and HinfI. Nine strains of C. gingivalis showed no bands by the conventional electrophoresis of digested DNA. However, twelve strains (6 strains of C. sputigena and 6 strains of C. ochracea) revealed bands by the electrophoresis of HinfI-digested DNA, and ten isolates had its own digestion patterns, indicating the presence of genetic variation. On the other hand, two strains of beta-lactamase-producing C. ochracea, one from blood and one from throat swabs obtained from a patient with acute leukemia, were classified as the same isolate by the identical digestion pattern and by the antimicrobial susceptibility test results, which strongly suggested that the oral lesion is the portal of entry into the blood.
TI  - Microflora in adult periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microflora of adult periodontitis was studied in 8 adults (36-47  years) and compared with that of 10 periodontally healthy individuals (36-43 years). A total of 64 periodontal lesions were examined, and classified according to the attachment level in three categories: attachment loss > 6 mm, attachment loss 4-6 mm and attachment loss < 4 mm. Also for comparative purposes 20 gingival sulci were evaluated. Samples were taken using three standardized paper points and were incubated anaerobically in selective and non-selective media. The results showed a statistically significant association of Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Capnocytophaga sputigena with moderate periodontal lesions, while Haemophilus segnis has been correlated to severe periodontal lesions. We concluded that C. gingivalis, C. sputigena and H. segnis might be potentially conductive to periodontal deterioration in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Properties of alkaline phosphatase in the gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - The isoenzymic properties of the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were investigated and compared with those in other cells, such as human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and human periodontal ligament cells (PDLs), and with those of three species of periodontopathic bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 (P. gingivalis), Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611 (P. intermedia), and Capnocytophaga sputigena ATCC33123 (C. sputigena). The biochemical properties of the isoenzymes were analyzed by the following methods: enzyme assays, inhibition pattern using three chemical inhibitors, 4 to 20% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thermostability, immunological specificity, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment. The inhibition experiment showed that ALP of the PMNs and PDLs possessed almost the same enzymatic properties of tissue-nonspecific ALP (bone/liver/kidney; TNSALP), and the ALP of the three species of periodontopathic bacteria possessed specific properties that were different from those of TNSALP, intestinal, or placental ALP. The ALP of the GCF was only slightly susceptible to levamisole (1 mM), L-phenylalanine (20 mM), and SDS (1%). An electrophoresis thermostability test demonstrated that the enzyme activity of the GCF was separated into one or two bands. The main heat-labile slow band contained the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-moiety-anchored ALP and possessed immunological specificity against anti-bone type ALP. The minor fast band was heat stable and showed mobility similar to that in P. gingivalis. These results indicated that the ALP of the GCF consisted of several ALP isoenzyme types whose possible origins are considered to be derived from phosphatidylinositol (PI) anchored ALP and periodontopathic bacterial ALP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal  DNA of human Capnocytophaga.
AB  - The confusion in the taxonomic status of the genus Capnocytophaga has made identification of strains and studies on the role of this genus in infectious diseases equivocal. In this study 33 strains of Capnocytophaga including reference strains and various clinical isolates, were studied using RFLP analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences from whole cell suspensions and isolated genomic DNA samples were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using eubacterial specific primers. PCR products were purified and characterized by single digestions with 12 restriction endonucleases. Five of these, BanI, CfoI, HaeIII, HphI and RsaII were found to discriminate reproducibly between strains, and restriction patterns (ribotypes) produced by these were analysed to clarify the classification of Capnocytophaga strains. Dendrograms inferring similarities were derived from these data by the UPGMA method. This analysis produced three major clusters of strains, each of which was associated with a previously proposed species type strain: C. gingivalis, C. sputigena and C. ochracea. The results support the division of Capnocytophaga into three species and demonstrate that, despite the heterogeneity of this genus, the modified ribotyping method provides a simple, rapid and reproducible way to identify Capnocytophaga strains.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from various Capnocytophaga strains possess potent Limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activity.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were extracted by the hot phenol-water method from three ATCC strains (C. sputigena ATCC 33612, C. ochracea ATCC 33596, and C. gingivalis ATCC 33624) and three clinical isolates (C. sputigena TE-1, C. ochracea ONO-26, and C. gingivalis M-12). Endospecy was used to determine the Limulus amoebocyte lysate clotting activities. The activities of LPSs from Capnocytophaga strains were stronger than those of Escherichia coli, with the exception of the LPS from C. gingivalis M-12. Except for the LPS from C. sputigena TE-1, the SDS-PAGE analyses of these preparations showed slow-migrating and repeating ladder bands similar to the LPSs of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (wild type) and included both the core-lipid A region and various lengths of O-antigen. The LPS from C. sputigena TE-1 possessed fast-migrating bands and did not have an O-side chain.
TI  - Effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. High ALPase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The ALPase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). By contrast, the activity of mammalian ALPase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% SDS. These results indicate that the ALPase assay in combination with 1% SDS can identify the origin of ALPase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. Clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that ALPase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of SDS-sensitive and SDS-resistant activities. These findings indicate that ALPase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also from a host response.
TI  - HLA-D and T lymphocyte reactivity to specific periodontal pathogens in type 1 diabetic periodontitis.
AB  - Bacterial antigen fragments complexed with class II major histocompatibility molecules (HLA-D) on antigen presenting cells (APCs) stimulate CD4+ T lymphocyte proliferation, presumably to protect the host. This study examined these responses to antigens of two periodontal pathogens in four groups (n = 15) of age- (young adult) and sex-matched Caucasian subjects with or without type 1 diabetes and moderate to severe periodontitis: Group DP = diabetics with periodontitis; Group DnP = diabetics without periodontitis; Group nDP = nondiabetics with periodontitis; and Group nDnP = nondiabetics without periodontitis. HLA-D phenotypes for each subject were determined by lymphocytotoxicity assays. T lymphocytes purified from peripheral blood were stimulated in cell culture with APC pulsed with various concentrations of tetanus toxoid, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sputigena antigens. T lymphocyte reactivity (3H thymidine incorporation) was numerically lower in cultures from diabetics stimulated with unpulsed APC (not significant), and antigen-pulsed cultures showed low proliferation and no significant differences among groups. Stimulation indices in cultures from diabetic patients stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. sputigena, however, were significantly elevated at all antigen concentrations compared to nondiabetic cultures. The occurrence of HLA-DR4 was moderately associated with diabetes (P < 0.05) and highly associated with periodontitis (P < 0.001, log-linear model for categorical variables); and HLA-DR53 and HLA-DQ3 were significantly associated with periodontitis (P < or = 0.02). HLA-DR was crucial to lymphocyte stimulation (anti-HLA-DR blocking experiments), but the low peripheral blood T cell reactivity to antigens of periodontal pathogens could not be linked with HLA-D type or periodontitis susceptibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Cervical abscess caused by Capnocytophaga ochracea].
AB  - Capnocytophaga is a gram-negative capnophilic bacterium which is part of the normal oral flora of humans (C. ochracea, C. gingivalis, C. sputigena) and mammals such as canines, cats, and rodents (C. animorsus and C. cynodegmi). Its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease is not well defined, and normally it represents an opportunistic germ of low pathogenicity. Threatening and fulminant infections have been observed in immunodeficient patients, and lately in immunocompetent hosts. We describe an otherwise healthy woman who developed a cervical abscess due to C. ochracea. Recurrent aphthous lesions are suspected to be the port of entrance for the germs. Bacteriological, clinical, epidemiological, and therapeutic aspects of Capnocytophaga infection are discussed.
TI  - Aspartame as a source of essential phenylalanine for the growth of oral anaerobes.
AB  - Phenylalanine and aspartic acid requirements were determined for 13 species of oral bacteria using the chemically defined medium OMIZ-W1. None of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas sputigena, Treponema pectinovorum, T. socranskii, or Wolinella recta required either of these amino acid constituents of aspartame (L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methylester). Phenylalanine was essential for the growth of Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium timidum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. vincentii, while aspartic acid was not required. With the exception of E. timidum, all phenylalanine-dependent strains could grow when the free amino acid was replaced by aspartame at concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those used for aspartame as an artificial sweetener.
TI  - Nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA encoding genes from Capnocytophaga ochracea ATCC 33596, Capnocytophaga sputigena ATCC 33612 and Capnocytophaga gingivalis ATCC 33624.
AB  
TI  - Serum antibody responses in human periodontitis to cellular components of Capnocytophaga.
AB  - Serum levels of IgM, IgG and IgG-antibody subclasses directed against cell envelopes, lipopolysaccharides and cytoplasmic fractions from Capnocytophaga sputigena, C. gingivalis and C. ochracea were examined in age-, race- and sex-matched periodontally healthy (n = 25) subjects and subjects with adult periodontitis (n = 25). The envelopes and cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by ballistic disintegration of the cells and ultracentrifugation. Cell envelopes were treated with DNase, RNase and lysozyme. Lipopolysaccharides were obtained by hot phenol-water extraction and treated with DNase and RNase. The relative levels of the antibodies in response to the cell fractions were measured by the streptavidinbiotin micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both groups showed IgM and IgG antibodies to each fraction of the three Capnocytophaga species, but the frequency of positive IgG subclass responses varied. The IgG4 responses were lower than the other subclasses. There were no significant differences between the IgM antibody levels of the two groups. However, the adult periodontitis group had significantly lower IgG antibody titres to the cell envelopes and cytoplasmic fractions of C. gingivalis and C. ochracea, and lipopolysaccharide of C. gingivalis. These results were reflected in the depressed levels of IgG1 and/or IgG2 to these cellular fractions from the same bacterial species. The adult periodontitis group also showed a lower level of IgG1 to the cytoplasmic fractions of C. sputigena without any depression in the total IgG antibody level. There were no significant differences between the groups in IgG3 and IgG4 antibody levels to any of the cellular fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Use of synthetic oligonucleotide DNA probes for the identification of different strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The ability of three different oligonucleotide probes to identify different oral  strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum was tested. Probes 119 and 214 were designed on the basis of known amino acid sequences from the N-terminal end of an outer membrane protein of F. nucleatum strain Fev1. Probe H 2.1, was a randomly cloned chromosomal DNA fragment of 2.1 kbp. The specificities of the probes were examined by testing each of them against a panel of five other species of Fusobacterium (six strains), oral and non-oral, and also against seven different oral species of six other genera. The chromosomal DNA of the bacteria to be examined was digested to completion using the restriction enzymes HincII, HindIII, EcoRI, EcoRV and Sau3AI. Digests were run on agarose gels and subjected to southern blotting before being hybridized with the probe in question. The results were confirmed by running a slot blot of genomic DNA from all of the 19 strains and hybridizing with a probe H 2.1. Probe H 2.1 turned out to be the most specific and useful of the three probes investigated. By use of this probe, interstrain identification of the six different strains of F. nucleatum could be performed and the strains could be distinguished from other oral species found in the oral cavity, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens and Leptotrichia buccalis. The probe reacted weakly with other non-oral species of the genus Fusobacterium, and there was no problem in distinguishing between the different strains.
TI  - Isolation and purification of bacteriocin from Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius).
AB  - Thirty-three out of 46 strains of Prevotella intermedia (Bacteroides intermedius) isolated from gingival deposits of patients with adult periodontitis possessed the ability to inhibit growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611, and 6 of the 33 showed strong inhibitory activity. Thirteen isolates did not have the ability to inhibit the growth of P. intermedia strain ATCC 25611. An inhibition factor from one of the isolates, P. intermedia TH14 which had strong inhibition, was purified and characterized. Bacteriocin TH14 activity was effective against only P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and Fusobacterium nucleatum, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including P. intermedia ATCC 33563, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Bacteroides gingivalis), Capnocytophaga sputigena and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellas were not inhibited by bacteriocin TH14. Bacteriocin TH14 was heat sensitive, proteinaceous with molecular weight of 1,700 daltons and inhibited the growth of strain ATCC 25611 in 15 minutes. The growth inhibition of P. intermedia ATCC 25611 by bacteriocin TH14 was found to be due to the bactericidal activity of the bacteriocin.
TI  - Identification by biotinylated DNA probes of Capnocytophaga species isolated from supragingival calculus.
AB  - The distribution, genetic relatedness, and peptidase activity in hydrolyzing N-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide by Capnocytophaga species isolated from calculus- and non-calculus-formers were determined in this study. The proportion and prevalence of Capnocytophaga species were higher in plaque samples from the calculus group than in those from the non-calculus group, and these bacteria showed high peptidase activity. C. gingivalis were found more frequently in the calculus group than in the non-calculus group, and possessed much higher peptidase activity than C. ochracea and C. sputigena. Black-pigmented colonies were also recovered more frequently from the calculus group than from the non-calculus group. Since these organisms had little or no peptidase activity, they were not studied further.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga orchracea, Capnocytophaga sp., Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sanguis. The enzymes produced by Capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mM chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. Glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. Chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mM inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. These observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
TI  - [Bacteriological study on juvenile periodontitis].
AB  - The predominant cultivable microflora of 23 pockets in 15 juvenile periodontitis  (JP) patients was studied for the first time in China using the current anaerobic methodology. Samples were taken with sterile paper points and dispersed on a vortex mixer. Then the diluted samples were plated on the non-selective blood agar plates and selective MGB medium which favors the growth of Actinobacillus actimycetemcomitans (Aa) and incubated in anaerobic chamber for 5 days. From each sample 15 or more isolated colonies were picked in sequence without selection and subcultured. The isolates were identified mainly by Schrechenberger's 4 hour rapid methods for biochemical and fermentative tests and the chromatographic analysis of acid end products using ion-chromatography. The results were as follows: 1. The microflora of healthy sulci of 7 healthy young subjects was significantly different from that in the pocket of JP patients. The predominant species in healthy sulci were Streptococcus spp and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. 2. The species increased significantly in JP patients in prevalence and proportions was Eubacterium. Other species in high proportions were Bacteroides oris, B. melaninogenicus, B. gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Actinomyces meyeri, etc. 3. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the samples.
TI  - Microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  - Animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. The rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. Furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues with ligatures. Experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. Studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. Studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. However, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. In the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.
TI  - In vitro sensitivity of oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria to the bactericidal activity of human neutrophil defensins.
AB  - Neutrophils play a major role in defending the periodontium against infection by  oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga spp. We examined the sensitivity of these bacteria to a mixture of low-molecular-weight peptides and highly purified individual defensin peptides (HNP-1, HNP-2, and HNP-3) isolated from human neutrophils. Whereas the Capnocytophaga spp. strains were killed significantly by the mixed human neutrophil peptides, the A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens strains were resistant. Killing was attributable to the defensins. The bactericidal activities of purified defensins HNP-1 and HNP-2 were equal, and both of these activities were greater than HNP-3 activity against strains of Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The strain of Capnocytophaga ochracea was more sensitive to defensin-mediated bactericidal activity than either C. sputigena or C. gingivalis was. The three human defensins were equipotent in killing C. ochracea. C. ochracea was killed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and over a broad pH range. Killing was most effective under hypotonic conditions but also occurred at physiologic salt concentrations. We concluded that Capnocytophaga spp. are sensitive to oxygen-independent killing by human defensins. Additional studies will be required to identify other components that may equip human neutrophils to kill A. actinomycetemcomitans, E. corrodens, and other oral gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Protein profiles of Capnocytophaga species.
AB  - Ninety-seven strains of Capnocytophaga isolated from the oral cavity and the type strains of C. ochracea, C. sputigena and C. gingivalis were compared by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins. The protein patterns were highly reproducible and were used as the basis for numerical taxonomic analysis. The clusters containing the type strains of C. ochracea and C. sputigena segregated at the 78% similarity level. Some of the eight clusters obtained at this level showed good correlation with grouping based on the results of biochemical testing for lactose and galactose fermentation and nitrate reduction. No consistent association was found between protein profiles and colony type, size or colour or cell length but all agar-adherent colony types segregated into a single cluster.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - Prepubertal periodontitis: a review of diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and differential diagnosis.
AB  - This paper reviews the literature on prepubertal periodontitis (PP) according to  the definition and the classification of PP by Page. The generalized form of PP (G-PP) defined by Page was identified as the oral manifestation of a systemic disease called leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) and thus the pathogenesis is known at the molecular level. On the other hand, the localized form of PP (L-PP) is a disease defined by clinical criteria and its pathogenesis is not known at the molecular level. The reported prevalence of L-PP differs widely in reports, according to the methodology and population studied. However, it seems to be at least 0.84% or greater. Potential periodontal pathogens that have been associated with L-PP include the following bacteria: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Eikenella corrodens. Suggested contributing factors have included PMN or monocyte chemotactic defects and cementum defects. There is no unique pattern of bone loss in L-PP; however, there may be a type of periodontitis that affects all deciduous teeth, in the absence of LAD. L-PP may lead to localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) or generalized juvenile periodontitis (GJP). Histiocytosis X, hypophosphatasia and mild forms of blood dyscrasias may have minimal or no clinical signs and symptoms except for alveolar bone loss. Therefore diseases known to be associated with alveolar bone loss must be definitively excluded in prepubertal children until the pathogenesis of L-PP at the cellular and molecular levels is understood and L-PP can be definitively diagnosed either as a distinct disease entity or entities.
TI  - Bactericidal concentrations of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel and  stannous fluoride gel for subgingival bacteria tested in serum at short contact times.
AB  - In vitro inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in serum of chlorhexidine-digluconate, amine fluoride gel, stannous fluoride gel, stannous fluoride, metronidazole and amoxicillin were determined against Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The minimal inhibitory concentration was assessed by the agar dilution technique. The killing curves and minimal bactericidal concentration of the antimicrobial agents in inactivated bovine serum were determined after 5, 10, 20 and 60 minutes contact time. The minimal inhibitory concentration varied amongst the tested bacteria. A concentration of 128 micrograms/ml chlorhexidine digluconate, 20 mg/ml amine fluoride gel, 1 mg/ml stannous fluoride, 128 micrograms/ml metronidazole and 4 micrograms/ml amoxicillin inhibited the growth of the tested species. The minimal bactericidal concentration in serum for B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena after 10 min contact time was 5 mg/ml for chlorhexidine digluconate and 100 mg/ml for amine fluoride gel. A concentration of 200 mg/ml stannous fluoride gel in serum was bactericidal for the tested species after 10 min contact time, with exception of F. nucleatum.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - The effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (IgG) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  - The influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (CIPD). The immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were determined by the microELISA technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). Considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. Significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to A. viscosus, S. sanguis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius, B. melaninogenicus, T. vincentii, and T. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. There was no consistent response to Capnocytophaga. When individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. Antibody levels to bacteria such as S. sanguis were modified during therapy. This would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.
TI  - Genomic relationships and species differentiation in the genus Capnocytophaga.
AB  - Ten epidemiologically independent Capnocytophaga strains from clinical materials  constituted three distinct DNA homology groups corresponding to the established species, Capnocytophaga ochracea, sputigena, and gingivalis. The three groups exhibited only low, or even insignificant degrees of genomic relatedness mutually, and to a reference culture of CDC group DF-2. All of five Capnocytophaga ochracea strains considered were involved in topic infections whereas four strains, isolated from blood belonged to either Capnocytophaga sputigena or Capnocytophaga gingivalis. However, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena could not be discriminated on the basis of DNA base composition, genome size, or phenotypic features including cellular fatty acids, lipoquinones, and various fermentation and hydrolase reactions. The need for additional phenotypic criteria characterizing species of Capnocytophaga is underlined by the present findings.
TI  - Microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  - Localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. To further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. Subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of 2 sites per child was determined. The subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga sputigena. These putative pathogens were found in various combinations. These findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.
TI  - Enzymatic and antigenic characterization of immunoglobulin A1 proteases from Bacteroides and Capnocytophaga spp.
AB  - Bacteroides and Capnocytophaga species have been implicated as periodontal pathogens. Some of these species possess immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases that are capable of cleaving the human IgA1 molecule in the hinge region, leaving intact Fc alpha and Fab alpha fragments. The purpose of this study was to characterize this activity. In addition to IgA1 protease activity in already known species, IgA1 protease activity was a feature of Bacteroides buccalis, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides veroralis, Bacteroides capillus, and Bacteroides pentosaceus. Results of immunoelectrophoretic and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses suggested that all species cleave the alpha-chain at the same peptide bond, i.e., the prolyl-seryl bond between residues 223 and 224 in the hinge region. The Bacteroides proteases could be classified as thiol proteases, which were at the same time dependent on metal ions, while the Capnocytophaga proteases were metallo enzymes. None of the proteases were inhibited by the physiologic proteases inhibitors alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. Investigations with enzyme-neutralizing antibodies raised in rabbits against protease preparations from the respective type strains revealed that, despite otherwise identical characteristics, the IgA1 protease of each Bacteroides species was antigenically distinct. Bacteroides buccae and the two later synonymous species B. capillus and B. pentosaceus produced identical proteases. In contrast, IgA1 proteases from Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena strains were apparently identical, while Capnocytophaga gingivalis had a protease that differed from those of the other Capnocytophaga species.
TI  - Laboratory studies of a family manifesting premature exfoliation of deciduous teeth.
AB  - In a previous publication, we described the clinical and radiographic findings of a family in which the children manifested premature exfoliation of the deciduous teeth. We now report for the same family the results of extensive laboratory studies performed on blood and urine, analysis of periodontal microflora, and a family pedigree. We demonstrated the presence of putative periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microflora, elevated levels of serum antibodies reacting to Bacteroides gingivalis, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and C. sputigena in 2 of the children, and significantly suppressed monocyte chemotaxis in all 3 children. Phosphoethanolamine was found in the urine of the father and all 3 children, but not in the mother. Likewise, serum alkaline phosphatase was abnormally low for all 3 children, and was at the extreme low end of normal range for the father, but was normal for the mother. On the basis of the alkaline phosphatase and phosphoethanolamine measurements, we assigned a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia to the 3 children. Phosphoethanolamine and alkaline phosphatase were also abnormal in the paternal grandmother and her brother. The son of this brother who was deceased had a daughter manifesting premature loss of the primary teeth. The data are consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. In the light of our findings, hypoplastic cementum must be considered in the etiology of some forms of early-onset periodontitis.
TI  - Sensitivity of Capnocytophaga species to bactericidal properties of human serum.
AB  - Capnocytophaga is a newly described genus of gram-negative bacteria which can cause serious oral and extraoral infections in the susceptible host. In the present study, sensitivity of Capnocytophaga spp. to the bactericidal properties of human serum was investigated. Laboratory strains representative of Capnocytophaga sputigena, C. ochracea, and C. gingivalis and seven oral isolates of Capnocytophaga spp. obtained in primary culture were determined to be sensitive to killing by pooled normal serum. In contrast, little or no killing of Capnocytophaga spp. was observed when these organisms were incubated in the presence of hypogammaglobulinemic serum despite evidence for alternative pathway activation. However, hypogammaglobulinemic serum could be reconstituted to bactericidal activity by the addition of the immunoglobulin M fraction of normal serum. Capnocytophaga spp. failed to activate the classical pathway in hypogammaglobulinemic serum, thus ruling out an antibody-independent mechanism of killing. In contrast, good correlation was observed between serum-mediated killing and antibody-dependent classical pathway consumption. These results indicate that complement in the presence of bactericidal antibody may be an important determinant of host resistance to intra- and extraoral infections caused by Capnocytophaga spp.
TI  - Assessment of serum antibody patterns and analysis of subgingival microflora of members of a family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - In a study of members of a large family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis, we sampled the subgingival microflora and characterized 40 isolates from each sample. We surveyed serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies reacting with any of a panel of 21 periodontal bacteria. The mother and 7 of her 13 children had early-onset periodontitis. Bacteroides gingivalis was not detected in the subgingival flora of any affected or unaffected family member, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from only one affected child. Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated from five of seven affected children and from none of their normal siblings. We found no significant differences among the floras from family members who had rapidly progressive, juvenile, and prepubertal forms of periodontitis. Elevated levels of serum antibody reacting with one or more of the bacteria tested were found in all family members with disease, but in only one periodontally normal family member. Both children with prepubertal periodontitis had antibodies reacting with C. sputigena, a species not found in their subgingival floras, but with none of the other bacteria tested. All remaining affected family members had antibodies to one or more serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans, and four had antibodies reacting with additional bacteria, including C. sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Haemophilus aphrophilus. Sera from patients contained antibodies specific for putative periodontal pathogens not found in their pocket flora, and conversely, putative periodontal pathogens for which no serum antibodies were found frequently comprised a large proportion (10% or more) of the pocket flora. In no case were both the bacterium and its antibody found. These observations are suggestive of sequential infection in the early-onset forms of periodontitis and of induction of protective immunity against reinfection by the same microorganism.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral Bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  - Seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 Bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. None coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Strains of Bacteroides buccae, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and B. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. However, six Bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. Most isolates of B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. intermedius, B. loescheii, B. oris, and B. veroralis coaggregated with strains of Actinomyces israelii, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, or Streptococcus sanguis. The strongest coaggregations involved B. denticola, B. loescheii, or B. oris; 22 of 25 strains coaggregated with A. israelii. Only B. loescheii interacted with certain strains of S. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between A. viscosus and the same strains of S. sanguis. In fact, B. loescheii and A. viscosus were competitors for binding to S. sanguis. Many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., S. sanguis and A. israelii). Evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.
TI  - Sodium fluoride susceptibilities of suspected periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Utilizing a blood-based medium, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) to sodium fluoride (NaF) of 45 bacterial strains representing 22 oral species. Bacterial susceptibility ranged from 128 micrograms/ml to 2048 micrograms/ml. Of those organisms tested, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinomyces viscosus were susceptible at lower levels of NaF.
TI  - Cellular fatty acids of Capnocytophaga species.
AB  - The cellular fatty acid composition of 18 clinical isolates and 4 reference strains of Capnocytophaga species (Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sputigena) was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The fatty acid profiles of the 22 cultures were essentially identical and were characterized by major amounts (60% or greater) of a saturated, iso-branched-chain, 15-carbon acid (13-methyl-tetradecanoate) and the presence of two relatively uncommon saturated, iso-branched, 3-hydroxy acids (13-methyl-3-hydroxy-tetradecanoate and 15-methyl-3-hydroxy-hexadecanoate). The presence and relative amounts of these acids distinguish Capnocytophaga spp. from other gliding bacteria.
TI  - Polyclonal B-cell activation induced by extracts of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from periodontally diseased sites.
AB  - The objective of this research was to determine whether gram-negative bacteria frequently isolated from periodontally diseased sites contained polyclonal B-cell activators. Polyclonal B-cell activation, which results in nonspecific activation of multiple B-cell clones was analyzed by a hemolysis-in-gel assay designed to detect a broad range of antibody specificities. Extracts from numerous bacterial strains, including Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Selenomonas sputigena, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were tested. Extracts of the above organisms were found to stimulate polyclonal antibody responses in cultures of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, although the magnitude of stimulation varied among the extracts. Optimal antibody-forming cell responses were found at stimulator doses between 5 and 1,000 micrograms/ml. We conclude that the resident gram-negative subgingival flora associated with periodontal lesions possesses potent polyclonal B-cell activators. These activators may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inducing B lymphocytes to produce antibody, osteolytic factors, or both and possibly other mediators of inflammation.
TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
TI  - Ultrastructure of gliding bacteria: scanning electron microscopy of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga ochracea.
AB  - When examined by both light and scanning electron microscopy, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. sputigena, and C. ochracea displayed three distinct growth zones: the original streak, an intermediate zone, and the advancing edge, or halo zone. On Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems)-soy-blood agar, the cells translocated by gliding. C. gingivalis and C. sputigena formed large, irregular isolated colonies, while C. ochracea formed a more confluent cell mass. The cells within the streak zone and in most of the intermediate zone were heaped into mounds, with the individual cells displaying a definite flow pattern, the latter characteristic of C. sputigena and C. gingivalis. The halo zone consisted of tracks of cells which appeared to have translocated back upon themselves, or were restricted in their outward movements by adjacent cells. Also present within the halo zone were small aggregates of cells, referred to as pioneer colonies. The cell surfaces of C. gingivalis and C. ochracea were smooth and free of any apparent extracellular material, whereas C. sputigena was covered with a thick amorphous material, as well as long, thick, cell surface-associated fibrils.
TI  - Fatty acid composition of gliding bacteria: oral isolates of Capnocytophaga compared with Sporocytophaga.
AB  - The extractable and bound lipids and cellular fatty acids of the gram-negative gliding bacteria, Capnocytophaga sputigena, C. gingivalis, and C. ochracea were compared to the non-host-related gliding bacterium Sporocytophaga myxococcoides. The extractable lipids represented between 17 and 28% of the cell dry weight, whereas only 2 to 4% of the lipids were in the bound fraction. The methyl esters of the cellular fatty acids were mainly aC15:0, which accounted for 69 to 73% of the total extractable fatty acids; S. myxococcoides had a similar distribution of branched-chain fatty acids; however, aC17:0 was the predominant fatty acid in this free-living gliding organism.
TI  - Capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. I. General characteristics, taxonomic considerations and significance.
AB  - The characteristics of gliding bacteria isolated from both healthy and diseased sites in the oral cavity are, summarized and the taxonomic position of the bacteria discussed. Uniform attirubtes of the fusiform isolates include gliding motility, strictly fermentative metabolism dependent on the presence of CO2 (or HCO3-), under either anaerobic or aerobic conditions, presence of benzidine-reactive components, and the production of acetic and succinic acids as the major or sole, acidic, metabolic and products. Given the guanine and cytosine content of DNA, their gliding motility, and the ability of many strains to attack polysaccharide a relationship to the cytophagus is suggested. This relationship, along with the CO2-dependent growth is recognized by the generic name Capnocytophaga given them. Many of the isolates are grouped into three species C. ochracea, C. Sputigena, and C. gingivalis, separated on the basis of morphological and physiological traits.
TI  - Capnocytophaga: new genus of gram-negative gliding bacteria. III. Physiological characterization.
AB  - Sixty-eight strains of capnophilic fusiform Gram-negative rods from the human oral cavity were subjected to extensive physiologic characterization, tested for susceptibility to various antibiotics, and the mol-percent guanine plus cytosine of each isolate determined. The characteristics of the isolates were compared with 10 fresh and 2 stock isolates of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The isolates clearly differed from the Fusobacterium species on the basis of mol-percent guanine plus cytosine, end products, growth in a capnophilic environment and fermentation of carbohydrates. All of the gliding isolates required CO2 and formed acetate and succinate, but not H2S, indole or acetylmethylcarbinol. All fermented glucose, sucrose, maltose and mannose. The organisms may be differentiated on the basis of fermentation of additional carbohydrates, hydrolysis of polymers and reduction nitrate. Three species are proposed: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. Ten isolates did not fit into the proposed species.
