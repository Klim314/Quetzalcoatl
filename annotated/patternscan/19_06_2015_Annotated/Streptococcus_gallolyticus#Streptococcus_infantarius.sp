TI  == genomics, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec).
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) is a group of human and animal derived streptococci that are commensals (rumen and gastrointestinal tract), opportunistic pathogens or food fermentation associates. the classification of sbsec has undergone massive changes and currently comprises 7 (sub)species grouped into four branches based on sequences identities: the streptococcus gallolyticus, the streptococcus equinus, the streptococcus infantarius and the streptococcus alactolyticus branch. in animals, sbsec are causative agents for ruminal acidosis, potentially laminitis and infective endocarditis (ie). in humans, a strong association was established between bacteraemia, ie and colorectal cancer. especially the sbsec-species s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an emerging pathogen for ie and prosthetic joint infections. s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and the s. infantarius branch are further associated with biliary and urinary tract infections. knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms is so far limited to colonization factors such as pili and biofilm formation. certain strain variants of s. gallolyticus subsp.  macedonicus and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius are associated with traditional dairy and plant-based food fermentations and display traits suggesting safety. however, due to their close relationship to virulent strains, their use in food fermentation has to be critically assessed. additionally, implementing accurate and up-to-date taxonomy is critical to enable appropriate treatment of patients and risk assessment of species and strains via recently developed multilocus sequence typing schemes to enable comparative global epidemiology. comparative genomics revealed that sbsec strains harbour genomics islands (gi) that seem acquired from other streptococci by horizontal gene transfer. in case of virulent strains these gi frequently encode putative virulence factors, in strains from food fermentation the gi encode functions that are pivotal for strain performance during fermentation. comparative genomics is a powerful tool to identify acquired pathogenic functions, but there is still an urgent need for more physiological and epidemiological data to understand sbsec-specific traits.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus is associated with digestive tract malignancies and resistance to macrolides and clindamycin.
AB  == objectives: this study was intended to delineate the association between digestive tract malignancies and bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. methods: we reviewed the medical records and microbiological results of patients with bacteraemia due to streptococcus bovis during the period 2000-2012. species and subspecies identification of isolates originally classified as s. bovis was confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing and pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assays. minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. results: of the 172 s. bovis complex isolates obtained from 172 patients  (age range, <1-94 years, median age, 66) with bacteraemia, 31 isolates were identified to be s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, 126 were s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus, and 15 were shown to be streptococcus infantarius. the majority (n = 104, 60%) of patients were male and had underlying malignancies (n = 87, 51%). bacteraemia due to s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus was significantly associated with endocarditis while s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus was more likely to be associated with malignancies of the digestive tract, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers. septic shock at presentation was the only factor associated with mortality among patients with bacteraemia due to either subspecies of s. bovis. isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus had higher rates of resistance to macrolides and clindamycin than isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus. conclusion: extensive diagnostic work-up for digestive tract malignancies and trans-esophageal echocardiogram should be investigated in  patients with bacteraemia caused by s. gallolyticus.

TI  == novel real-time pcr assays using taqman minor groove binder probes for identification of fecal carriage of streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex from rectal swab specimens.
AB  == real-time pcr based on the recn and gyrb genes was developed to detect four streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbec) subspecies from rectal swab specimens. the overall prevalence was 35.2%: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (11.1%), s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (13%), streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli (20.4%), and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius (11.1%). to conclude, these real-time pcr assays provide a reliable molecular method to detect sbec pathogenic subspecies from rectal swab specimens.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == streptococcus bovis group and biliary tract infections: an analysis of 51 cases.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in other  infections has not been well described. we analysed prospectively all patients with biliary tract infections caused by s. bovis group during the period 1988-2011. we selected those cases associated with cholangitis and cholecystitis, defined according to tokyo guidelines. identification of the strains was performed using the api 20 strep and the gp card of the vitek 2 system, and was confirmed by molecular methods. our series included 51 cases (30 cholangitis and  21 cholecystitis). the associated microorganisms were: streptococcus infantarius  (biotype ii/1) 29 cases (57%), streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) 20 cases (39%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  (biotype i) two cases (4%). the only difference found between s. infantarius and  s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was a greater association of the first with malignant strictures of the bile ducts: 48% (14/29) versus 5% (1/20), p <0.001. thirty-seven of the cases also had bacteraemia, causing 20% (37/185) of all s. bovis bacteraemia, with differences between s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (2/112; 2%) and the other two microorganisms: s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus  subsp. pasteurianus (35/73; 48%; p <0.001). the vast majority of biliary tract infections due to s. bovis group are caused by s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (s. bovis biotype ii), and nearly half of the bacteraemia due to these two species has a biliary source (43% of the s. infantarius and 56% of s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus).

TI  == comparative genome analysis of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18, an african fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis, taxonomic status, clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a large bacterial complex of facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci that includes distinct, genetically-related species. traditionally, s. bovis was classified into three biotypes: i (mannitol fermentation-positive), ii/1 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-negative), and ii/2 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-positive). the introduction of molecular techniques in the last few decades has led to proposals for a genetic classification of this complex: s. bovis biotype i belongs to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii/1 is, in fact, streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, designated as streptococcus lutetiensis, and s. bovis biotype ii/2 is streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, commonly designated as streptococcus pasteurianus. although this modern taxonomy is currently accepted, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with these terms. the importance of correct identification lies in the strong association between bacteriemia, endocarditis and/or colon cancer and the various subspecies. in general, s. bovis is more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other streptococci, but high levels of resistance to macrolides and tetracycline  have been described.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == the relationship between the new taxonomy of streptococcus bovis and its clonality to colon cancer, endocarditis, and biliary disease.
AB  == background: the nomenclature of streptococcus bovis has changed. the study aims were to examine and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infections based on the new taxonomy and the genetic relatedness of strains. methods: bacteremic cases from 2004 to 2010 at assaf harofeh medical center were  reviewed. vitek 2 later confirmed with polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was used for subspecies identification. vitek 2 later confirmed with etests was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) testing. repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of strains. results: twenty-four bacteremia cases were included. the median age of patients was 81 years (range 1 day to 91 years), two were neonates, three were pregnant, and 18 were elderly (>/= 65 years of age). the charlson's combined conditional age-related score was 8.2 +/- 2.9, and 11 (58 %) patients were immunosuppressed.  there were 13 patients who had s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, six had s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, four had s. infantarius subsp. coli, and one had s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. ten of 19 non-pregnant adult patients had  colon adenoma or carcinoma, three had acute biliary disease, and five had endocarditis. two patients died in the hospital. rep-pcr revealed polyclonality.  there were no significant associations between subspecies or genotypes and the various clinical characteristics or outcomes. conclusion: s. bovis bacteremia is  a serious disease that affects elderly immunosuppressed individuals. infection is strongly associated with colon pathology and endocarditis, regardless of the new  taxonomy or clone complex. the identification of s. bovis is of paramount importance, and microbiology laboratories should differentiate its processing from that of other s. viridans.

TI  == [diseases associated with bloodstream infections caused by the new species included in the old streptococcus bovis group].
AB  == objective: we sought to identify possible diseases associated with bloodstream infections caused by new species of s. bovis group isolated in blood cultures and by studying patient records methods: forty-four consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated s. bovis were further characterised using phenotypic methods patient records were examined. results: we identified 15 streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 24 streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and 5 streptococcus infantarius isolates in 44 bsi episodes. conclusions: the association between s. bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis and/or colon carcinoma is highly dependent on the causative species. streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is a surrogate for endocarditis and/or bowel disease, whereas streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus is a surrogate for hepato-biliary disease.

TI  == a novel multiplex pcr/rflp assay for the identification of streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex members from dairy microbial communities based on the 16s rrna gene.
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) comprises pathogenic species associated with different degrees with human infections but also spontaneously fermented dairy products. we aimed therefore at developing a specific identification assay for the sbsec targeting the 16s rrna gene comprising a multiplex pcr followed by a differentiating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp). the multiplex pcr assay was positively applied on 200 sbsec isolates including reference strains. the assay did not yield false-positive amplifications with strains of closely related bacteria and isolates of non-sbsec streptococci, lactococci, enterococci, and other genera of  dairy origin. the downstream rflp using msei and xbai enabled further discrimination of streptococcus infantarius/s. bovis (biotype ii.1) from streptococcus gallolyticus (biotype i and ii.2)/streptococcus alactolyticus and s. equinus. furthermore, the newly developed primers can be used directly for sanger sequencing. conclusively, this novel pcr/rflp assay is applicable in the complex dairy microbial communities and provides an important tool to assess the  prevalence of members of the sbsec in dairy products.

TI  == reidentification of streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == a case of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis with colon cancer: identification by 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == although the association between streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma is well known, very few cases of s. bovis infection associated with underlying malignancies have been reported in korea. the s. bovis group has been  recently reclassified and renamed as streptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus infantarius subspecies under a new nomenclature system. we report a case of infective endocarditis with colon cancer caused by s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously named s. bovis biotype i). a 59-yr-old woman presented with a 1-month history of fever. initial blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci, and echocardiography showed vegetation on mitral and aortic  valves. antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started. the infecting strain was a catalase-negative and bile-esculin-positive alpha-hemolytic streptococcus susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. the strain was identified as s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with the use of the  vitek 2 gpi and api 20 strep systems (biomerieux, usa). the 16s rdna sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 100% homology with those of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus reported in genbank. the identification of the infecting organism, and the subsequent communication among clinical microbiologists and physicians about the changed nomenclature, led to the detection of colon cancer.  the patient recovered after treatment with antibiotics, valve surgery, and operation for colon cancer. this is the first report of biochemical and genetic identification of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus causing infective endocarditis associated with underlying colon cancer in a korean patient.

TI  == adherence characteristics of endocarditis-derived streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis biotype i) isolates to host extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == members of the streptococcus bovis group are frequent colonizers of the intestinal tract, which can also cause endocarditis. however, their ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues and the factors associated with pathogenicity are largely unknown. here, we assessed 17 endocarditis-derived human isolates [identified here as 15 streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (s. bovis biotype i), one s. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) and one streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli (biotype ii/1)] for their in vitro adherence  to components of the extracellular matrix (ecm). adherence to collagen type i was found to be the most common phenotype exhibited by 76% of isolates, followed by collagen type iv (53%), fibrinogen (47%), collagen type v (35%) and fibronectin (35%). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that >50% of endocarditis-derived s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus isolates are genetically diverse, although two clusters of two and four isolates were observed. the diversity of strains and differences observed in adherence characteristics to distinct host ecm proteins suggest that isolates of s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus produce different surface components, similar to other gram-positive pathogens, to colonize the host and cause infection.

TI  == comprehensive study of strains previously designated streptococcus bovis consecutively isolated from human blood cultures and emended description of streptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli.
AB  == modern taxonomy has delineated streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli, and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius within the heterogenous group of previously designated clinical streptococcus bovis bacteria. in the present study, 58 consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated s. bovis were further characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular genetic methods, and possible  disease associations were investigated by studying the patients' records. published phenotypic characteristics of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius were not unequivocal and did not allow an unambiguous phenotypic differentiation of the 58 clinical isolates. however, full-length 16s rrna gene sequences clearly assigned the strains to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (n = 29), s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (n = 12), and s. infantarius subsp. coli (n = 17). only 28% of the patients with available records presented with endocarditis  and 7% presented with colon carcinoma, whereas 37% of the patients had altered liver parenchyma and 28% had gall bladder disease as underlying diseases. detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on both s. gallolyticus subspecies and s. infantarius subsp. coli are given for the first time. as a result of the extensive characterization of the largest number of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius human clinical isolates published so far, emended species descriptions are given. it is recommended that both clinical microbiologists and  infectious disease specialists avoid the designation s. bovis for true s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius strains in the future in order to get a clearer picture of the possible disease associations of these species.

TI  == geno- and phenotypic diversity of avian isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis) and associated diagnostic problems.
AB  == recently, strains of streptococcus bovis were reclassified as streptococcus gallolyticus. in the present study we describe for the first time an outbreak of  s. gallolyticus in a broiler flock. mortality during the first week was normal (<1%), with a final total mortality at the end of production reaching 4.3%. specific symptoms were not observed. postmortem pathology demonstrated enlarged and light spleens and livers accompanied by multifocal irregular necroses surrounded by a hemorrhagic zone. in addition, these birds suffered from arthritis and osteomyelitis. strains isolated from liver and spleen lesions showed clonality as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. compared to strains representing previously derived phylogeny, including the s. bovis-s. equinus complex, the 16s rrna-derived phylogeny of the strains investigated in this study demonstrated a paraphyletic group (s. gallolyticus) well separated from two monophyletic groups: (i) s. equinus-s. bovis plus s. infantarius and (ii) s. alactolyticus plus s. intestinalis. according to information in genbank,  none of the strains included from the two monophyletic groups have been isolated  from birds. further biochemical analyses, including tannase activity, identified  for the first time avian isolates belonging to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. however, these investigations also demonstrated a clear heterogeneity with pigeon isolates.

TI  == new group d streptococcal species.
AB  == background & objectives: the heterogeneity of group d streptococci led to the identification of various biotypes of streptococcus equinus and streptococcus bovis and to the description of new species. the objective of the present study was to improve the phenotypic delineation between species and to clarify their respective phylogenetic position. methods: physiological and genomic analyses were carried out in 84 representative strains of the group d streptococci. biotypes were determined with the api 20 strep and rapid id 32 strep systems of identification. quantitative dna-dna hybridization under stringent conditions and values of the deltat(m) allowed to delineate species and subspecies. the phylogenic position of the different genomic groups was determined by comparing the sequences of their 16s rdna. results: four dna-clusters, including seven species or subspecies, were characterized. differential associations of biochemical characters allowed their identification. s. equinus and the type strain of s. bovis belonged to a single species. s. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii.2, and s. macedonicus formed a single dna-cluster including three different subspecies. these were designated as s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus. the two other dna-clusters corresponded to the two subspecies of s.  infantarius, and to s. alactolyticus. interpretation & conclusion: this study presented a new classification associated with an identification scheme of group  d streptococci. the changes in this classification demonstrate the interest of a  polyphagic approach of the bacterial identification.

AB  == 'streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus' is a large bacterial complex including different species frequently isolated from infections of humans (streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius) or animals (s. bovis, s.  equinus, streptococcus alactolyticus). the separation of s. bovis into three different biotypes has been partially correlated with genetic differentiation. in addition, recent advances in bacterial phylogeny have led to the inclusion of streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius in this complex. the aim of this study was to improve physiological differentiation between species related to the complex and to clarify their respective phylogenetic positions. in this study, physiological, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of a set of 88 streptococcal strains were performed. the diversity of strains of s. bovis biotype ii was analysed, and it was confirmed that they belong to different species, either s. equinus or s. infantarius. it was demonstrated that s. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii.2, s. macedonicus and s. waius form a single dna cluster separated into three different subspecies. they are delineated by different biochemical traits, limited dna-dna relatedness and noticeable divergence in 16s rdna sequences. according to the current definition of species, the names s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov. and s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. are proposed for these three subspecies.

TI  == taxonomic dissection of the streptococcus bovis group by analysis of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda) sequences: reclassification  of 'streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli' as streptococcus lutetiensis sp. nov.  and of streptococcus bovis biotype 11.2 as streptococcus pasteurianus sp. nov.
AB  == the taxonomic dissection of the streptococcus bovis-streptococcus equinus group was carried out upon obtaining sequences for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda) of the type strains of s. bovis, streptococcus caprinus, s. equinus, streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius, streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius. the soda sequences of 29 streptococcal strains of animal and human origin that were related to s. bovis were also sequenced. a phylogenetic analysis of the soda sequences revealed that the s. bovis-s. equinus group comprises five different clusters that correspond to five  distinct species. the type strains of s. bovis and s. equinus were associated in  the same cluster, corresponding to the species s. equinus. the type strains of s. caprinus, s. gallolyticus, s. macedonicus and s. waius were associated in the same cluster, which defined a single species containing s. gallolyticus and its junior synonym s. caprinus, and s. macedonicus and its junior synonym s. waius. the two subspecies thought to constitute the species s. infantarius, namely s. infantarius subsp. infantarius and 's. infantarius subsp. coli', were located in  two distinct clusters. one of these clusters defined the species s. infantarius and included the type strain of s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. the other cluster defined 's. infantarius subsp. coli', leading to the proposal of its reclassification as the novel species streptococcus lutetiensis (nem 782t = cip 106849t). the remaining cluster comprised all of the strains previously identified as belonging to s. bovis biotype 11.2, leading to the proposal to reassign these strains to the novel species streptococcus pasteurianus (nem 1202t = cip 107122t). the results of the phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by dna-dna hybridization experiments, thus demonstrating that sequence databases of  defined dna targets, such as soda, may constitute a valuable alternative approach for modern bacterial systematics.

TI  == 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis distinguishes biotypes of streptococcus bovis: streptococcus bovis biotype ii/2 is a separate genospecies and the predominant clinical isolate in adult males.
AB  == we characterized 22 human clinical strains of streptococcus bovis by genotypic (16s rrna gene sequence analysis [microseq]; applied biosystems, foster city, calif.) and phenotypic (api 20 strep and rapid id32 strep systems (biomerieux vitek, hazelton, mo.) methods. the strains, isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and urine, formed two distinct 16s ribosomal dna sequence clusters.  three strains which were associated with endocarditis urinary tract infection (uti), and sepsis clustered with the s. bovis type strain atcc 33317 (cluster 1); other closely related type strains were s. equinus and s. infantarius. nineteen strains clustered at a distance of about 2.5% dissimilarity to the s. bovis type  strain (cluster 2) and were associated with central nervous system (cns) disease  in addition to endocarditis, uti, and sepsis. all strains were distinct from s. gallolyticus. within cluster 2, a single strain grouped with atcc strain 43143 (cluster 2a) and may be phenotypically distinct. all the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to s. bovis biotype ii/2 (mannitol negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). the api 20 strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as s. bovis biotype ii/2, those of cluster 1 as s. bovis biotype ii/1, and that of cluster 2a as s. bovis biotype i. there was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: s. bovis biotype ii/2 isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, and s. infantarius type strains and are the most common isolates in adult males.
