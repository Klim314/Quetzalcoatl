TI  == efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in japanese  women.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of pid that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once  daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 japanese women with acute pid. the clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on days 15 and 29. the most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were c. trachomatis (12 strains), prevotella bivia (10 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). the clinical success rate on day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). the clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. all adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for pid caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. the therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of pid in japanese women. registration number: nct00871494.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == [clinical and bacteriological features of six cases with intracranial abscess in  childhood].
AB  == from october 1988 to march 2001, 5 patients with 6 episodes of intracranial abscesses were admitted to chiba-children's hospital. average age when they were  admitted was 10 years and 1 month. initial clinical symptoms were fever in 5 cases, and headache in 1 case. it took 21 days from the appearance of the initial symptoms to diagnose the intracranial abscess. four out of 5 patients had underlying diseases that were prone to cause intracranial abscess. two patients of these were cyanotic congenital heart diseases (tetralogy of fallot and asplenic heart), and the other 2 were sinusitis. computed tomography revealed that brain abscess was found in 5 cases, and subdural empyema in 1 case. there were 3 single and multiple abscesses each. the most common lesion was the temporal lobe. eight bacterial strains were isolated from 5 cases. five were streptococci (3 were streptococcus milleri group, other 2 were streptococcus oralis and microaerophilic streptococcus) and 3 were anaerobes (prevotella loescheii, prevotella bivia and fusobacterium nucleatum). antimicrobial therapy was started with panipenem-betamiprone in 3 cases, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin in the other cases resre ctinely. duration of therapy ranged from 28 to 67 days (45 days, average). in 5 cases, drainage with craniotomy was performed in addition to antimicrobial therapy. one case was treated medically alone, but this was the only case with recurrence after 1 year  2 months. there were no serious complications such as intraventricular rupture of abscess. all patients had good outcomes, but mild neurological sequela was found  in 1 case.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == proteolysis and utilization of albumin by enrichment cultures of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == subgingival dental plaque consists mainly of microorganisms that derive their energy from amino acid fermentation. their nutrient requirements are met by the subgingival proteolytic system, which includes proteases from microorganism and inflammatory cells, and substrate proteins from sulcus exudate, including albumin. to determine the selective effect of individual proteins on microbiota,  we used albumin as the main substrate for growth. eight subgingval plaque samples from untreated periodontal pockets of patients with adult periodontitis were inoculated in peptone yeast medium with bovine albumin (9 g/l). after three subculture steps, cell yields of the enrichment cultures at the medium with 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/l albumin were determined. proteolytic activity (u/absorbance at 550 nm) of the enrichment cultures and different isolates derived from the cultures was estimated by the degradation of resorufin-labeled casein. it was observed that the yield of the mixed culture was albumin limited,  and the proteolytic activities of the cultures in albumin broth were higher than  in control (peptone broth). among the isolates from the enrichment cultures, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae and prevotella bivia demonstrated proteolysis. the frequent occurrence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus anginosus in the albumin cultures is explained by their ability to utilize arginine as an energy source for growth. albumin in the medium was partly degraded by pure cultures but completely consumed in enrichment cultures, indicating synergy of bacterial proteinases. it  is concluded that the subgingival microbiota possesses proteolytic activity and may use albumin as a substrate for their growth. enrichment cultures on albumin may serve as a relatively simple in vitro model to evaluate the effects of proteinase inhibitors.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  == objective: to assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. methods: ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within  15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. demographic, labor,  delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. results: bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (p = .02). isolates included group b streptococcus (n = 5), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of prevotella bivia, g vaginalis,  and viridans streptococci (n = 1). bacteremia was associated with earlier median  gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. conclusion: bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. many of the isolates are capable  of causing endocarditis. appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora in vitro.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of candida albicans infection and clotrimazole treatment on vaginal microflora. methods: studies were conducted using a model simulating the healthy vaginal ecosystem. the model consisted of a mixed culture  of lactobacillus acidophilus, staphylococcus epidermidis, prevotella bivia, and group d streptococcus sp grown in continuous culture in a chemically defined medium. the status of the model was assessed using a mathematical equation that determines the probability a microflora is normal or abnormal. results: challenge of the model with c albicans was followed within 24 hours by the development of microbial populations representing an abnormal microflora. treatment of the system with clotrimazole (100 micrograms/ml) resulted in a decrease in c albicans counts to 0 within 48 hours. however, treatment also altered other components of  the vaginal microflora, which did not return to normal. addition of clotrimazole  (100 micrograms/ml) to the system in the absence of c albicans also resulted in an abnormal model by 24 hours. conclusions: candida albicans infection of the vaginal ecosystem, as represented by this in vitro model, has a deleterious effect on members of the normal microflora. clotrimazole, although effective against c albicans infection, also has a deleterious effect on components of the  normal vaginal microflora. one of the implications for women using clotrimazole for microbiologically undocumented vaginal yeast infections is an increased risk  of infection or disease through the disruption of the protective microflora barrier.

TI  == internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  == twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (two cases stage o; four cases  stage ia; five cases stage ib; one case stage iia; ten cases stage iib; two cases stage iiia; one case stage iva) served as the subjects. the bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. there was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. the average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. the predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis, and prevotella bivia. as the stages of cervical cancer progressed, g.  vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. these findings suggest that there is a relationship between g. vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.
