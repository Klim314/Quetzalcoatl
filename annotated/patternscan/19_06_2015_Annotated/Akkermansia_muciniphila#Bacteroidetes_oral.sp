TI  == conjugated linoleic acid supplementation under a high-fat diet modulates stomach  protein expression and intestinal microbiota in adult mice.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract constitutes a physiological interface integrating nutrient and microbiota-host metabolism. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) have been reported to contribute to decreased body weight and fat accretion. the modulation by dietary cla of stomach proteins related to energy homeostasis or microbiota may be involved, although this has not been previously analysed. this  is examined in the present study, which aims to underline the potential mechanisms of cla which contribute to body weight regulation. adult mice were fed either a normal fat (nf, 12% kj content as fat) or a high-fat (hf, 43% kj content as fat) diet. in the latter case, half of the animals received daily oral supplementation of cla. expression and content of stomach proteins and specific bacterial populations from caecum were analysed. cla supplementation was associated with an increase in stomach protein expression, and exerted a prebiotic action on both bacteroidetes/prevotella and akkermansia muciniphila. however, cla supplementation was not able to override the negative effects of hf  diet on bifidobacterium spp., which was decreased in both hf and hf+cla groups. our data show that cla are able to modulate stomach protein expression and exert  a prebiotic effect on specific gut bacterial species.
