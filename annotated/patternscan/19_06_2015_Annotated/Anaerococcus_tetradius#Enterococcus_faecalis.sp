TI  == a comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  == background and objectives: evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. the present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. materials and methods: to analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions  were employed: a. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 5% b. sodium hypochlorite (naocl) 3% c. chlorhexidine 2% d. chlorhexidine (chx) 0.12% e. doxycycline 0.01% f. doxycycline 0.005% g. mtad. an agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. enterococcus faecalis (mtcc-439) 2. candida albicans (mtcc-183) 3. fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586) 4. peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc-27337) the inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. the inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. by this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against  different pathogens could be compared. results: mtad showed maximum antibacterial activity. in case of c. albicans mtad was less effective than 5% naocl, 3% naocl  and 2% chx, 0.12% chx. however, it was more effective against e. faecalis, f. nuleatum and p. anaerobicus. in any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only  prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. e. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against c. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. conclusion: it was found that mtad was more antimicrobial than 5% naocl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of mtad to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% naocl. in addition, 5 and 3% naocl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. the best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% naocl.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == comparative antibacterial efficacies of hydrodynamic and ultrasonic irrigation systems in vitro.
AB  == introduction: to ensure root canal treatment success, endodontic microbiota should be efficiently reduced. the in vitro bactericidal effects of a hydrodynamic system and a passive ultrasonic irrigation system were compared. methods: single-rooted extracted teeth (n = 250) were contaminated with suspensions of enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, mixed aerobic cultures, or mixed anaerobic cultures. first, the antibacterial effects of the hydrodynamic system (rinsendo), a passive ultrasonic irrigation system (piezo smart), and manual rinsing with 0.9% nacl (the control) were compared. colony-forming units were counted. second, the 2 systems were used with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) alone or naocl + 0.2% chlorhexidine (chx). the colony-forming units in the treated and untreated roots were determined during a period of 5 days. results: both irrigation systems reduced bacterial numbers more effectively than manual rinsing (p < .001). with nacl, ultrasonic activated irrigation reduced bacterial  counts significantly better than hydrodynamic irrigation (p = .042). the naocl +  chx combination was more effective than naocl alone for both systems (p < .001),  but hydrodynamic irrigation was more effective with naocl + chx than the passive  ultrasonic irrigation system. conclusions: both irrigation systems, when combined with naocl + chx, removed bacteria from root canals.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (oscc) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an oscc and a  control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. material and methods: swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and etest. results: the predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were  aerobes. the ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the oscc group. altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. the most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 staphylococcus species, 14 enterococcus faecalis, 36 neisseria species, 14 escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 peptostreptococcus species, 39 fusobacterium species, and 34 prevotella species. the resistance rates in the oscc group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. conclusion: gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative  infections in patients with oscc. this tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. clinical relevance: biofilms  on oscc surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. as a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == bacteria isolated from dugongs (dugong dugon) submitted for postmortem examination in queensland, australia, 2000-2011.
AB  == microbial infection may contribute to disease in a significant proportion of marine mammal mortalities, but little is known about infectious bacterial species and their prevalence in dugongs (dugong dugon). this study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the university of queensland's school of veterinary science for postmortem examination. thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of  contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. the most abundant bacteria included aeromonas spp., clostridium spp., vibrio spp., enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas spp. in six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. mixed infections containing aeromonas spp. and vibrio spp.; morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida, and serratia marcescens; and actinomyces spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and enterococcus faecalis was associated  with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. the significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. it is also difficult to fulfil koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial  and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission.

TI  == infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  == background/aim: infected total knee arthroplasty (tka) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. the aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following tka. methods: this retrospective study of infected tkas was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the orthopedics & traumatology clinic of the military medical academy (mma) in belgrade. a total of 654 primary and revised tkas were performed in the  said period. we registered and surgically treated 28 infected tkas (primary tkas: mma--22, other institutions--6). the incidence of tka infection in the mma was 3.36%. the most common pathogens were: staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. other isolated pathogens were: enterococcus  faecalis, klebsiella pneum., klebsiella spp., streptoccocus viridans, seratia spp, micrococcus luteus and peptostreptococcus spp. in one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. we analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected tkas. results: in our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. conclusion: two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected tka, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. the antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most  cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.

TI  == evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on  11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell  growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e.  faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

TI  == vulvar abscess: a retrospective review.
AB  == vulvar abscesses can progress to cause significant illness requiring disfiguring  surgical debridement, broad spectrum antibiotics, and require hospitalization. a  retrospective review of de-identified charts of 13 patients admitted for inpatient care for vulvar abscesses from 2004-2009 at west virginia university hospitals was conducted. risk factors for vulvar abscess in these patients included obesity and diabetes. body mass index (bmi) is directly proportionate to the size of the abscess and increased risk of intensive care unit admission. most patients did not seek medical care prior to hospital admission. polymicrobial infections were common, and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus was seen  in two cases. the presence of multiple risk factors increased the length of hospitalization. clinicians should be aware of these risk factors and initiate aggressive therapy for patients with elevated bmi or multiple risk factors.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == sudan azo dyes and para red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species  of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade sudan dyes and para red. among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35  species tested were able to reduce sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively, to some extent. bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and ruminococcus obeum were able  to reduce completely all four tested sudan dyes and para red. escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested sudan dyes and para red to any significant extent. metabolites of the reduction of the tested sudan dyes and para red by e. faecalis were isolated and identified by hplc and lc/esi-ms analyses and compared with authentic standards. thus it appears that the ability to reduce sudan dyes and para red except sudan ii is common among bacteria in the human colon.

TI  == molecular analysis of persistent periradicular lesions and root ends reveals a diverse microbial profile.
AB  == introduction: the microbial etiology of periradicular lesions is recognized; however, the bacterial profile of these lesions is not well elucidated. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization in these lesions and to characterize the bacterial community present in root ends and periradicular lesions. methods: thirty-four adult patients who presented for  apicoectomy of persistent periradicular lesions after endodontic therapy were selected for the study and samples of periradicular tissue and resected root ends collected. total bacterial levels were estimated for 34 paired periradicular lesions and root ends using real-time polymerase chain reaction with universal bacterial primers. sixteen pairs of these samples were analyzed using ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing for bacterial identification. results: bacteria were detected more consistently and at higher levels in root ends. periradicular lesions exhibited a diverse microbial profile with many uncultivated phylotypes.  enterococcus faecalis and burkholderia cepacia predominated in both samples. campylobacter gracilis and streptococcus gordonii were associated with root ends, whereas atopobium rimae, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus genomospecies c8, dialister sp e2_20 e1, and eubacterium strain a35mt were associated with periradicular lesions. conclusions: persistent periradicular lesions are polymicrobial infections with many as-yet-uncultivated and unknown bacterial species. the bacterial load and microbial profile of root ends is significantly different from the soft-tissue lesion, indicating the presence of diverse bacterial populations in these tissues.

TI  == effectiveness of ozone against endodontopathogenic microorganisms in a root canal biofilm model.
AB  == aim: to assess the antimicrobial efficacy of aqueous (1.25-20 microg ml(-1)) and  gaseous ozone (1-53 g m(-3)) as an alternative antiseptic against endodontic pathogens in suspension and a biofilm model. methodology: enterococcus faecalis,  candida albicans, peptostreptococcus micros and pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in planctonic culture or in mono-species biofilms in root canals for 3 weeks. cultures were exposed to ozone, sodium hypochlorite (naocl; 5.25%, 2.25%), chlorhexidine digluconate (chx; 2%), hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2); 3%) and phosphate buffered saline (control) for 1 min and the remaining colony forming units counted. ozone gas was applied to the biofilms in two experimental settings, resembling canal areas either difficult (setting 1) or easy (setting 2) to reach. time-course experiments up to 10 min were included. to compare the tested samples, data were analysed by one-way anova. results: concentrations of gaseous ozone down to 1 g m(-3) almost and aqueous ozone down to 5 microg ml(-1)  completely eliminated the suspended microorganisms as did naocl and chx. hydrogen peroxide and lower aqueous ozone concentrations were less effective. aqueous and  gaseous ozone were dose- and strain-dependently effective against the biofilm microorganisms. total elimination was achieved by high-concentrated ozone gas (setting 2) and by naocl after 1 min or a lower gas concentration (4 g m(-3)) after at least 2.5 min. high-concentrated aqueous ozone (20 microg ml(-1)) and chx almost completely eliminated the biofilm cells, whilst h(2)o(2) was less effective. conclusion: high-concentrated gaseous and aqueous ozone was dose-, strain- and time-dependently effective against the tested microorganisms in suspension and the biofilm test model.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == photodynamic therapy for endodontic disinfection.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) on endodontic pathogens in planktonic phase as well as on enterococcus faecalis biofilms in experimentally infected root canals of extracted teeth. strains of microorganisms were sensitized with methylene blue (25 microg/ml) for  5 minutes followed by exposure to red light of 665 nm with an energy fluence of 30 j/cm2. methylene blue fully eliminated all bacterial species with the exception of e. faecalis (53% killing). the same concentration of methylene blue  in combination with red light (222 j/cm2) was able to eliminate 97% of e. faecalis biofilm bacteria in root canals using an optical fiber with multiple cylindrical diffusers that uniformly distributed light at 360 degrees. we conclude that pdt may be developed as an adjunctive procedure to kill residual bacteria in the root canal system after standard endodontic treatment.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == influence of residual bacteria on periapical tissue healing after chemomechanical treatment and root filling of experimentally infected monkey teeth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: first, to determine the influence on the healing of the periapical tissues when selected bacterial strains and combinations thereof remain after root canal treatment; and, second, the relationship to healing of the quality of the root filling. in eight monkeys, 175 root canals, previously infected with combinations of four or five bacterial strains and with radiographically verified apical periodontitis, were endodontically treated, bacteriologically controlled, and permanently obturated.  after 2-2.5 yr, the periapical regions were radiographically and histologically examined. of these teeth, 48 root canals were also examined for bacteria remaining after removal of the root fillings. when bacteria remained after the endodontic treatment, 79% of the root canals showed non-healed periapical lesions, compared with 28% where no bacteria were found. combinations of residual bacterial species were more frequently related to non-healed lesions than were single strains. when no bacteria remained, healing occurred independently of the  quality of the root filling. in contrast, when bacteria remained, there was a greater correlation with non-healing in poor-quality root fillings than in technically well-performed fillings. in root canals where bacteria were found after removal of the root filling, 97% had not healed, compared with 18% for those root canals with no bacteria detected. the present study demonstrates the importance of obtaining a bacteria-free root canal system before permanent root filling in order to achieve optimal healing conditions for the periapical tissues.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  == to verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental chagas disease, germ-free nih swiss mice were mono-associated with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides vulgatus or peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the y strain of trypanosoma cruzi. all the mono-associations predominantly induced a th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by t. cruzi. a direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production (p<0.05) in e. faecalis-, b. vulgatus-, and peptostreptococcus-associated mice. moreover, higher levels of anti-t. cruzi igg1 and anti-t. cruzi igg2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. on the other hand, with the exception of e. faecalis-associated mice,  mono-association induced a lower il-10 production after infection (p<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (p<0.05) of il-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for e. faecalis-associated animals. in conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with t. cruzi  in gnotobiotic mice. however, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.

TI  == toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  == the colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through toll-like receptors (tlr). the colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mrna for tlr3 and less for tlr2 and -4. little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern  recognition receptors in human colon. the aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. tlr2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen.  in contrast, tlr3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. ht29 and caco-2 had different levels of expression for tlr1-4. co-culture of ht29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mrna for tlr1-4. in contrast, caco-2 cells were  refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mrna levels. tlr3 was induced in ht29 only by gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mrna and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. this pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the  crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. in contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == evaluation of root canal microorganisms isolated from teeth with endodontic failure and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == studies of the microbiota from the canals of teeth with failure of endodontic therapy have revealed that it differs markedly from that of untreated necrotic dental pulps. this study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of 30 root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the most prevalent species. microbial samples, isolation and speciation were done using advanced microbiologic techniques for anaerobic species. a total of 55 bacterial species were isolated, 80% were gram-positives and 58% facultative anaerobic microorganisms. the bacterial genera most frequently recovered were enterococcus, streptococcus, peptostreptococcus and actinomyces. antibiotic sensitivity of enterococcus faecalis and peptostreptococcus spp. was accomplished with the e-test system. all species studied were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate. however, 20% of the e.faecalis strains were resistant to erythromycin and 60% to azithromycin. it was concluded that microbial flora in canals after endodontic failure comprised predominantly facultative anaerobes and gram-positive species. e.faecalis was the species most frequently isolated and showed erythromycin and azithromycin resistance among the isolates.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

AB  == we report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. all cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, citrobacter freundii and staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. bacteroides bivius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. bacteroides fragiris, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. in all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. these four patients, however, all survived. once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in  the workplace where accidents often happen.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic effect of lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of irrigants on biofilms of  root canal isolates.
AB  == aim: the bactericidal effect of four antimicrobial agents was investigated against single-species biofilms derived from a range of root canal isolates. methodology: single-species biofilms of prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum and enterococcus faecalis were generated on membrane filter discs and subjected to 15 min or 1 h incubation with 5 p.p.m. colloidal silver, 2.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 0.2% chlorhexidine, 10% iodine or phosphate buffered saline (pbs) as a control. the antimicrobial activity of the agents was neutralized and the bacterial cells  were harvested from the discs by vortexing, serially diluted in reduced transport fluid, plated on fastidious anaerobe agar containing 5% horse blood, incubated anaerobically and colony-forming units calculated. results: iodine and naocl were more effective than chlorhexidine except against p. micros and p. intermedia where they were all 100% effective. iodine and naocl elicited a 100% kill after 1 h incubation for all strains used. however, after 15 min, they showed differing bactericidal effects depending on the strain. none of the agents were effective against f. nucleatum after 15 min but naocl, iodine and chlorhexidine were all effective after 1 h. colloidal silver was generally ineffective. conclusions: the effectiveness of a particular agent was dependent on the nature of the organism in the biofilm and on the contact time. naocl was generally the most effective agent tested, followed by iodine. however the clinical efficacy of these agents must be considered in light of the complex root canal anatomy and polymicrobial nature of root canal infections.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == [in vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (lvfx) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), ampicillin (abpc), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. the clinical isolates except vibrio cholerae were collected in japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. mics  were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the japan society of chemotherapy. some isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the mic50 of lvfx against mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. lvfx was the most active against mrsa among the antibiotics tested. most of staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. lvfx showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. in particular, all streptococcus pneumoniae strains including prsp were susceptible to lvfx at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. among enterococcus, abpc showed superior activity against enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of enterococcus species were resistant to abpc. lvfx was more active against to these enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. on the other hand, lvfx and cpfx showed similar activity against isolates of enterobacteriaceae. cpfx had an mic50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and lvfx showed an mic50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. lvfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against acinetobacter species than cpfx (mic50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). haemophilus influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis and v. cholerae were  inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. the mic90 of lvfx  and cpfx were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. some isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the mic50 of lvfx and cpfx were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. among anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than  peptostreptococcus species, and the mic90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. in conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of lvfx compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. and  our results suggest that lvfx may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the  combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5  mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall  incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has  the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  == glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. the one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. the results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13c-nmr studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. these oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by streptococcus mutans, and they  effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. in an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by bifidobacteria.

TI  == tissue penetration of meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. the median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/ml. the median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. these tissue concentrations exceed the mics of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. a single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by  susceptible pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == study of gene transfer in vitro and in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice from lactococcus lactis strains to various strains belonging to human intestinal  flora.
AB  == the use of genetically modified organisms (gmo) in dairy products requires evaluation of the dna transfer capacity from such organisms among the human intestinal microflora. thus, both in vitro and in vivo [in the digestive tract (dt) of mice] transfer from lactococcus lactis donor strains of the conjugative plasmid pil205 (cmr) and the non-conjugative plasmid pil253 (emr) to: (1) recipient strains isolated from human faecal flora bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. (strictly anaerobic bacterial strains) and enterococcus faecalis, (2) a whole human faecal flora, was studied.  in both cases, no gene transfer was observed to strictly anaerobic bacterial strains. dna transfer was only observed to the e. faecalis strain: in vivo cmr e. faecalis transconjugants were isolated from sequentially multi-associated mice and when the recipient strains associated with the mice, they were a defined mixture of bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. and e. faecalis strains. when mice were associated with the whole human faecal flora, the plasmid pil205 was transferred into some facultative anaerobic streptococci.  it was also shown that dna transfer occurred even when the lactococcal donor strain was transient in the dt of the gnotobiotic host animals.

AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals.
AB  == ten freshly extracted teeth which had carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions contiguous with the root apex were placed inside an anaerobic chamber and the apical 5 mm of the root canals cultured. in addition to anaerobic incubation, duplicate cultures were incubated aerobically. fifty strains of bacteria from the 10 root canals were isolated and identified. the most prominent bacteria cultured from the 10 root canals were actinomyces, lactobacillus, black-pigmented bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, nonpigmented bacteroides, veillonella, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus mutans. of the  50 bacterial isolates, 34 (68%) were strict anaerobes. this study demonstrates the presence of predominantly anaerobic bacteria in the apical 5 mm of infected root canals in teeth with carious pulpal exposures and periapical lesions.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  == the distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants tet k, tet l, tet m, and tet o were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, gardnerella  vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus spp.,  and veillonella parvula. among the peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for tet k (27%), tet l (30%), tet m (75%) and tet o (13%). of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. the distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: tet k, 36%; tet l, 31%; tet m, 43%; tet o, 61%. twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group b streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the tet k, tet l, and tet o determinants were found in only a few strains, while the tet m determinant predominated. a total of 29% of the f. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the g. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the v. parvula isolates hybridized with the tet m determinant. in contrast, 43% of the lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the tet o determinant. the data indicate that  tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.

TI  == [a clinical study of asymptomatic bacteriospermia].
AB  == asymptomatic bacteriospermia was studied as an entity and its treatment was investigated in 65 subjects who clinically needed their semen tested. the obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. the rate of detection of bacteria  in semen was 89.2%, and the rates of detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  were 55.4% and 70.8%, respectively. forty gram-positive strains were identified among the aerobic bacteria; rates of detection for staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were high, and 6 strains (9.2%) of streptococcus agalactiae were also present. the rate of detection of gram-negative bacteria was low; only  3 strains were identified. among the anaerobic bacteria 90 gram-positive strains  were identified; the rate of detection of peptostreptococcus (58 strains) was high, and only 11 strains of gram-negative bacteria were present. 2. among cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin, lomefloxacin, latamoxef and flomoxef (fmox), fmox was, in general, superior to the other drugs in terms of antibacterial activities against those strains isolated from semen. 3. bacterial changes were observed in  the semen specimens from 11 subjects who were subjected to oral administration of ccl (1,500 mg/days). after the treatment, 25 strains of bacteria disappeared but  7 strains remained among 32 strains that were present before treatment, and 23 strains appeared due to superinfection.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
