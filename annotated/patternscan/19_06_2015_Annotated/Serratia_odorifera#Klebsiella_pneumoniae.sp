TI  == fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in community setting in casablanca.
AB  == background: the importance of community-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-pe) has been  increasingly recognized in recent years. this study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of esbl-pe in the community in casablanca, morocco. methods: during 6 months (2013), 93 fecal samples were examined for esbl-pe. isolates expressing an esbl phenotype were investigated for the presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of esbl genes. results: the prevalence of fecal carriage of esbl-pe was 4.3% (4/93; 95% ci, 0.2-8.4). klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), enterobacter cloacae (n = 2), escherichia coli (n = 1), and serratia odorifera (n = 1) were the esbl-producing  species. four (66.7%) of these isolates were multidrug-resistant. the blashv-12 (n = 5) was the most frequent esbl gene detected, followed by blactx-m-15 (n = 3).the non-esbl gene detected was blatem-1 (n = 5). one isolate harbored the qnrb1 variant. results of conjugation experiments indicated that blashv-12 + blatem-1 + qnrb1 and blactx-m-15 + blatem-1 genes were co-transferred and that these genes were carried by a conjugative plasmid of high molecular weight (125 kb). conclusion: our results show the importance of the intestinal tract as a reservoir for esbl-pe in the community in morocco.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a protected denomination of origin portuguese semihard  cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae and micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of  raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. standard plate counts (log cfu per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. species identified within this family encompassed klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sakazakii, and escherichia coli; klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella terrigena, and serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. no salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. viable counts of micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. species identified within this family encompassed staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and ph. statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and  moisture content than between viable numbers and ph. the results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the  indicators total mesophile and enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100-  and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. however, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4  months of ripening), sao jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus, as well as absence of salmonella.

TI  == bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of iv catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. design: case series. animals: 100 dogs. procedure: catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. the distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% nacl) solution. the saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. all bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. results: bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. most bacteria  that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (serratia odorifera, s. liquefaciens, s. marcescens, acinobacter anitratus, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp). only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (staphylococcus intermedius and streptococcus spp). high percentages of organisms were resistant  to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. conclusions and clinical  relevance: results suggest that iv catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.

TI  == [escherichia coli: diversity of biochemical phenotypes in aquatic environments (santa, fe, argentina)].
AB  == during certain environmental conditions, the floating aquatic vegetation, mainly  represented by eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) invade and even cover water  courses assigned to recreational activities or to the supply of drinkable water.  the rhizosphere of these plants constitutes an unknown biotope of bacteria of sanitary interest, possibly different from waters without vegetation and of the sediment of the same aquatic system. to verify such possibility, 206 isolated strains in macconkey agar (difco) were typified and identified (78 from water, 65 from sediment and 63 from rhizosphere) using the api 20 e system (v. 4.0) and apilab plus software (v 3.3.3), both of biomerieux (marcy-l'etoile, france, 1998). nineteen different biochemical phenotypes from e. coli were found. the 79% of the population belonged to only 7 phenotypes; the 21% remaining, to the other  12 phenotypes. twelve phenotypes did not share the biotopes, while only 4 were in the three. these results (and those obtained by other authors who used the api 20 e system in other biotopes) suggest that it would be possible to characterize the rhizosphere using those phenotypes that are found in smaller proportion. the greatest index of diversity (h) and evenness (e) were found in the rhizosphere (h = 2.903; e = 0.874). the dendrogram (average distances and upgma method) reaffirms the dissimilarity in biochemical phenotypes of e. coli populations of the rhizosphere with regard to the other biotopes. the most abundant bacterial species in the three biotopes were e. coli, klebsiella terrigena and k. pneumoniae, corresponding to 75.2% of the community. the rhizosphere differed from serratia odorifera and from klebsiella spp. because of its higher rate of isolation.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
