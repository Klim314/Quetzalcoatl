molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. to investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cdna of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cbd-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. their predicted peptides share identical n-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. the two longer isoforms, cbd-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the c terminus. to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cbd, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus; mics of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mics of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (candida albicans; mic of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and u. canigenitalium (mic of 200 mug/ml). antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mm. all three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. in situ hybridization indicated that cbd-1 was expressed primarily in sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. in contrast, cbd-2 was located primarily within leydig cells. the longest isoform, cbd-3, was detected in sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. the tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.
ofloxacin. a reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. it has good in vitro activity against most enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis and haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. however, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. the efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated c. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). again, ofloxacin demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. the availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. the tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. the most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. it was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. conclusion: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of c. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated pid, although its acceptance as monotherapy in pid is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.
[azithromycin: critical points].
the determination of the french breakpoints (< or = c, > c) were selected by the  use of different criteria including bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and obviously clinical criteria. concerning the bacteriological results, azithromycin, being an acid stable orally administered antimicrobial drug, is in vitro marginally less active than erythromycin against gram-positive organisms including beta-haemolytic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus. but in contrast, this azalide is more active than erytromycin against many gram-negative pathogens, notably neisseria gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and borrelia burgdorferi. the activity of azithromycin is unaffected by the inoculum, unlike of ph, serum, and presence of co2 for anaerobes. however, erythromycin-resistant micro-organisms are also resistant to azithromycin. considering the pharmacokinetic criteria and the clinical results such as infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts, skin and soft tissues, uncomplicated urethritis/cervicitis associated with n. gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis or u. urealyticum, the preliminary breakpoints of azithromycin are defined by the following concentrations (< or = 0.12 and > 4 mg/l). additional experimental and clinical results are required to confirm the in vitro activity against some other bacterial species (e. faecalis, l. monocytogenes, brucella, p. multocida, or even salmonella and shigella).
comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. spanish collaborative group.
the activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups c, g and f, brucella melitensis, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against campylobacter spp. in general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. clarithromycin was bactericidal against streptococcus spp. and haemophilus influenzae.
in vitro susceptibilities of mycoplasma pneumoniae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum to sparfloxacin and pd 127391.
the in vitro activities of two investigational quinolones, sparfloxacin (previously designated at 4140) and pd 127391, were determined for 30 strains each of mycoplasma pneumoniae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin. erythromycin was the most active compound against m. pneumoniae (maximum mic, less than 0.008 microgram/ml). pd 127391 (mics, less than 0.008 to 0.031 microgram/ml), sparfloxacin (mics, less than 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml), clindamycin (mics, less than 0.008 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and tetracycline (mics, 0.063 to 0.25 microgram/ml) were superior to ciprofloxacin (mics, 0.5 to 2 microgram/ml). sparfloxacin and pd 127391 were active against m. hominis (mics, less than 0.008 to 0.031 microgram/ml for each) at concentrations comparable to those of clindamycin (mics, less than 0.008 to 0.063 microgram/ml) and at concentrations lower than those of ciprofloxacin (mics, 0.125 to 0.5 microgram/ml). as expected, m. hominis was resistant to erythromycin (mics, 32 to greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml). for u. urealyticum, pd 127391 (mics, 0.031 to 0.5 microgram/ml) and sparfloxacin (mics, 0.063 to 1 microgram/ml) were superior to erythromycin (mics, 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), ciprofloxacin (mics, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml), and clindamycin (mics, 0.25 to 64 micrograms/ml. both new quinolones were equally active against tetracycline-susceptible as well as resistant strains of m. hominis and u. urealyticum. the possible influence of medium components and/or ph on mics was evaluated by testing a staphylococcus aureus reference strain with each antibiotic in sp-4 broth and 10-b broth and comparing the results with published mics for this strain. mics determined in 10-b broth for erythromycin were affected most. this study shows that the activities of sparfloxacin and pd 127391 are similar to one another and comparable or superior to those of other drugs used to treat mycoplasmal infections. the mics of both new quinolones were consistently 2 to several dilutions lower than those of ciprofloxacin for each species.
effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of ureaplasma urealyticum.
all of the 14 serotype standard strains of ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. a 1 mm concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. the presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. this differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. for the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. for the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified. the effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. the concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus mycoplasma (m. hominis, m. fermentans, and m. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mm manganese. the latter concentration inhibited the growth of acholeplasma laidlawii and staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mm manganese had no effect on escherichia coli.
