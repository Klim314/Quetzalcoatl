TI  - Desulfobaculum xiamenensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the family Desulfovibrionaceae isolated from marine mangrove sediment.
AB  - A taxonomic study was carried out on strain P1(T), which was isolated from mangrove sediment samples collected from Qinglan Port (Hainan, China). Cells were curved rods, that were motile, with a single polar flagellum. The strain was non-spore-forming with a cell size of 0.6x1.5-2.2 microm. Catalase and oxidase activities were not detected. Growth was observed in the temperature range 22-44 degrees C (optimum, 35-40 degrees C) and pH range 5.5-8.5 (optimum, pH 7.0). NaCl was required for growth and tolerated at up to 3.5% (w/v) (optimum, 0.5%). Strain P1(T) utilized hydrogen, succinate, L-malate, citrate, oxalate, DL-lactate, pyruvate, or cysteine as electron donors, and sulfate or sulfite as electron acceptors. Fermentation products from pyruvate were acetate, H(2) and CO(2). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain P1(T) formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the family Desulfovibrionaceae. Strain P1(T) was most closely related to members of the genera Desulfovibrio (92.0-94.3% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Desulfocurvus (91.1%), Bilophila (87.9%) and Lawsonia (86.0%) of the family Desulfovibrionaceae. The DNA G+C content of strain P1(T) was 64.5 mol% and the major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15:0) (18.8%), anteiso-C(15:0) (5.0%), C(16:0) (14.2%) and iso-C(17:1)omega9c (24.4%). The predominant menaquinone was MK-7 (97%). Major polar lipids were phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. Strain P1(T) was distinguishable from members of phylogenetically related genera by differences in several phenotypic properties. On the basis of the phenotypic and phylogenetic data, strain P1(T) represents a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Desulfobaculum xiamenensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Desulfobaculum xiamenensis is P1(T) (=CGMCC 1.5166(T)=DSM 24233(T)).
TI  - Colonic infection by Bilophila wadsworthia in pigs.
AB  - Bilophila wadsworthia is a common inhabitant of the human colon and has been associated with appendicitis and other local sites of inflammation in humans. Challenge-exposure or prevalence studies in laboratory and other animals have not been reported. B. wadsworthia is closely related phylogenetically to Desulfovibrio sp. and Lawsonia intracellularis, which are considered colon pathogens. We developed a PCR specific for B. wadsworthia DNA. Samples of bacterial DNA extracted from the feces of pigs on six farms in Australia and four farms in Venezuela were examined. Specific DNA of B. wadsworthia was detected in the feces of 58 of 161 Australian and 2 of 45 Venezuelan pigs, results comprising 100% of the neonatal pigs, 15% of the weaned grower pigs, and 27% of the adult sows tested. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis of PCR product DNA derived from pigs or from known human strains showed an identical pattern. Histologic examination of the intestines of weaned B. wadsworthia-positive pigs found no or minor specific lesions in the small and large intestines, respectively. B. wadsworthia is apparently a common infection in neonatal pigs, but its prevalence decreases after weaning. The possible role of B. wadsworthia as an infection in animals and in human colons requires further study.
TI  - Taurine reduction in anaerobic respiration of Bilophila wadsworthia RZATAU.
AB  - Organosulfonates are important natural and man-made compounds, but until recently (T. J. Lie, T. Pitta, E. R. Leadbetter, W. Godchaux III, and J. R. Leadbetter. Arch. Microbiol. 166:204-210, 1996), they were not believed to be dissimilated under anoxic conditions. We also chose to test whether alkane- and arenesulfonates could serve as electron sinks in respiratory metabolism. We generated 60 anoxic enrichment cultures in mineral salts medium which included several potential electron donors and a single organic sulfonate as an electron sink, and we used material from anaerobic digestors in communal sewage works as inocula. None of the four aromatic sulfonates, the three unsubstituted alkanesulfonates, or the N-sulfonate tested gave positive enrichment cultures requiring both the electron donor and electron sink for growth. Nine cultures utilizing the natural products taurine, cysteate, or isethionate were considered positive for growth, and all formed sulfide. Two clearly different pure cultures were examined. Putative Desulfovibrio sp. strain RZACYSA, with lactate as the electron donor, utilized sulfate, aminomethanesulfonate, taurine, isethionate, and cysteate, converting the latter to ammonia, acetate, and sulfide. Strain RZATAU was identified by 16S rDNA analysis as Bilophila wadsworthia. In the presence of, e.g., formate as the electron donor, it utilized, e.g., cysteate and isethionate and converted taurine quantitatively to cell material and products identified as ammonia, acetate, and sulfide. Sulfite and thiosulfate, but not sulfate, were utilized as electron sinks, as was nitrate, when lactate was provided as the electron donor and carbon source. A growth requirement for 1,4-naphthoquinone indicates a menaquinone electron carrier, and the presence of cytochrome c supports the presence of an electron transport chain. Pyruvate-dependent disappearance of taurine from cell extracts, as well as formation of alanine and release of ammonia and acetate, was detected. We suspected that sulfite is an intermediate, and we detected desulfoviridin (sulfite reductase). We thus believe that sulfonate reduction is one aspect of a respiratory system transferring electrons from, e.g., formate to sulfite reductase via an electron transport system which presumably generates a proton gradient across the cell membrane.
