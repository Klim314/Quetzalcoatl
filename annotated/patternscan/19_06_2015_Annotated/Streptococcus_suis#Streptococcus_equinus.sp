TI  == suicin 3908, a new lantibiotic produced by a strain of streptococcus suis serotype 2 isolated from a healthy carrier pig.
AB  == while streptococcus suis serotype 2 is known to cause severe infections in pigs,  it can also be isolated from the tonsils of healthy animals that do not develop infections. we hypothesized that s. suis strains in healthy carrier pigs may have the ability to produce bacteriocins, which may contribute to preventing infections by pathogenic s. suis strains. two of ten s. suis serotype 2 strains isolated from healthy carrier pigs exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogenic s. suis isolates. the bacteriocin produced by s. suis 3908 was purified to homogeneity using a three-step procedure: ammonium sulfate precipitation, cationic exchange hplc, and reversed-phase hplc. the bacteriocin,  called suicin 3908, had a low molecular mass; was resistant to heat, ph, and protease treatments; and possessed membrane permeabilization activity. additive effects were obtained when suicin 3908 was used in combination with penicillin g  or amoxicillin. the amino acid sequence of suicin 3908 suggested that it is lantibiotic-related and made it possible to identify a bacteriocin locus in the genome of s. suis d12. the putative gene cluster involved in suicin production by s. suis 3908 was amplified by pcr, and the sequence analysis revealed the presence of nine open reading frames (orfs), including the structural gene and those required for the modification of amino acids, export, regulation, and immunity. suicin 3908, which is encoded by the suia gene, exhibited approximately 50% identity with bovicin hj50 (streptococcus bovis), thermophilin 1277 (streptococcus thermophilus), and macedovicin (streptococcus macedonicus). given  that s. suis 3908 cannot cause infections in animal models, that it is susceptible to conventional antibiotics, and that it produces a bacteriocin with  antibacterial activity against all pathogenic s. suis strains tested, it could potentially be used to prevent infections and to reduce antibiotic use by the swine industry.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of musca domestica (diptera: muscidae).
AB  == musca domestica l. (diptera: muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. on the basis of the cdna library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named as566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cdna ends from m. domestica larva  stimulated with salmonella pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella). in this study, the full-length as566 gene was cloned and inserted into a his-tagged escherichia coli (enterobacteriaceae: escherichia) prokaryotic expression system  to enable production of the recombinant protein. the recombinant as566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active as566 protein. the bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified as566 protein was assessed using the oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that as566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an e. coli clinical isolate, s. pullorum, streptococcus bovis (streptococcaceae: streptococcus), streptococcus suis, and staphylococcus aureus  (staphylococcaceae: staphylococcus) in vitro. the antibacterial activity of as566 toward gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against gram+ bacteria. the sequencing results and blast analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene as566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in genbank. the antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered as566 protein warrant further study.

TI  == [new insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  == this article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. the article focuses on pathogens monitored by the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all european union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium bovis, brucella spp., coxiella burnetti and verotoxin-producing e. coli (vtec)/shiga-like toxin producing e. coli (stec). as  particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. the article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ecdc but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: streptococcus iniae, s. suis, s. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: staphylococcus intermedius, s. pseudintermedius. those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. the exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. these abilities derive from dna rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kda. partial n-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin hj50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by streptococcus bovis and streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. we determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. even though the gene clusters  of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin hj50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. bovicin hj50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by streptococcus suis strains sc84 and d12, enterococcus columbae plch2, clostridium perfringens jgs1721 and several bacillus strains. all these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. in conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of s. macedonicus during food fermentation.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == streptococcus henryi sp. nov. and streptococcus caballi sp. nov., isolated from the hindgut of horses with oligofructose-induced laminitis.
AB  == four gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid-shaped isolates were obtained from the caecum and rectum of horses with oligofructose-induced equine laminitis. phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on these isolates. initial biochemical profiling assigned two of the isolates to streptococcus bovis. the other two isolates, however, could not be assigned conclusively on the basis of their biochemical profiles. gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the four new isolates were related most closely to streptococcus suis based on the 16s rrna gene and to streptococcus orisratti based on the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda). sequence divergence values from recognized streptococcus species based on these two genes were >3 and >13%, respectively, for all four isolates. phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the four isolates formed two distinct clonal groups that are suggested to represent two novel species of the genus streptococcus. the names proposed for these organisms  are streptococcus henryi sp. nov. (type strain 126(t) =atcc baa-1484(t) =dsm 19005(t)) and streptococcus caballi sp. nov. (type strain 151(t) =atcc baa-1485(t) =dsm 19004(t)).

TI  == simple and rapid pcr method for identification of streptococcal species relevant  to animal infections based on 23s rdna sequence.
AB  == a pcr identification system targeting 23s rdna sequences for the identification of eight streptococcal species relevant to animal infections (streptococcus agalactiae, s. bovis, s. canis, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. porcinus, s. suis and s. uberis) was developed. this system consists of two pcr reactions, a and b, in which seven and eight primers, respectively, are used simultaneously, and was  designed so that each amplification product indicates a species by its size. a total of 111 cultures, including the type strain of eight species, could be successfully identified and differentiated as individual species, except for the  cross reactivity between s. bovis and s. equinus. the developed pcr system can complete the identification procedure for eight streptococcal species through two tube reactions per isolate, and, therefore, might provide a rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tool for veterinary laboratories.

TI  == what happened to the streptococci: overview of taxonomic and nomenclature changes.
AB  == since the division of the streptococcus genus into enterococci, lactococci, and streptococci in 1984, many changes in the nomenclature and taxonomy of the streptococcus genus have taken place. the application of genetic comparisons has  improved the proper classification of the different species. the lancefield system of serogrouping the streptococci by the expression of beta-hemolysis on blood agar plates is still very useful for the identification of streptococci for patient management. the lancefield grouping system cannot be used in itself for accurate identification of specific beta-hemolytic species, but it can be a useful part of the identification procedure. except for identification of the "streptococcus bovis group" of species and streptococcus suis, lancefield grouping is of little value in identification of the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci and related genera. in fact, identification of the non-beta-hemolytic species is problematic for conventional as well as commercially available identification procedures. a combination of conventional tests and specific chromogenic tests suggested by several investigators is presented and discussed. tables are included that suggest tests and procedures to guide investigators attempting to identify all the species.

TI  == development of a brucella suis specific hybridisation probe and pcr which distinguishes b. suis from brucella abortus.
AB  == a genomic library was prepared from brucella suis dna (mboi digested) and cloned  into the bamhi site of puc18. colony hybridisation using a probe prepared from purified b. suis dna labelled with alpha 32p was carried out to identify colonies of interest. about 20 colonies, which gave an intense signal upon hybridisation with whole b. suis genomic dna as a probe, were selected. because of the high degree of dna homology between b. suis and brucella abortus, a short probe was chosen as it would more likely give species specificity. of seven fragments selected to probe whole b. suis, b. abortus, and yersinia enterocolitica dna, one was found to hybridise with b. suis only. the probe was sequenced in two directions and sense and anti sense primers of 25bp in length were chosen to yield a product of 421bp. after optimisation of the pcr, a product of 420bp was obtained with b. suis template dna and two bands of 420 and 650bp were detected with b. abortus template dna. this is the first reported pcr of the brucella genome where a single pair of primers will discriminate between b. suis and b. abortus. no band was observed when the two primers were used to amplify e. coli,  y. enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, corynebacterium bovis, or serratia marcescens template dna.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == purification and partial characterization of a novel antibacterial agent (bac1829) produced by staphylococcus aureus ksi1829.
AB  == a novel antimicrobial agent from staphylococcus aureus ksi1829, designated bac1829, was purified by sequential steps of ammonium sulfate precipitation, sephadex g-50 gel filtration chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. purified bac1829 has a molecular mass of 6,418 +/- 2 da. the peptide in heat stable, since full biological activity is retained after heating  at 95 degrees c for 15 min, and it is destroyed by digestion with proteases. amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of ala and gly residues, which respectively comprised 24 and 19% of the total amino acid content. additionally, high levels of hydrophobic amino acids were present, accounting for the hydrophobic nature of bac1829. purified bac1829 killed exponentially growing corynebacterium renale in a dose-dependent manner by a bactericidal mode of action. a partial inhibitory spectrum analysis revealed that the following organisms were sensitive to the inhibitory activity of bac1829: s.  aureus rn4220, streptococcus suis, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, c. renale, corynebacterium diptheriae, haemophilus parasuis, bordetella pertussis, bordetella bronchoseptica, moraxella bovis, and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  == streptococcus suis was the most frequent streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of strep. dysgalactiae. the intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of strep. bovis, strep. hyointestinalis and strep. suis. many of these intestinal strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. this species was not found in tonsils and intestines  but was about equally prevalent as strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. other streptococci were rare in this material. enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. in intestinal samples enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, ent. hirae and ent. cecorum were most frequently found. in faeces ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. the characteristics of the less well known species strep. alactolyticus and strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines  for their differentiation from strep. bovis and strep. suis given.

TI  == culture media for enterococci and group d-streptococci.
AB  == lancefield group d-streptococci are contaminants of various food commodities, especially those of animal origin. they encompass the new genus enterococcus comprising 13 known species and some species of streptococci which have their habitat in the intestine of animals, e.g. streptococcus bovis, suis and equinus.  the serologically based grouping may no longer constitute the best definition for streptococci from the food chain. food hygiene monitoring systems using enterococci as indicators need reliable methods for selective cultivation and identification of marker strains. up to now more than 100 modifications of selective media have been described for isolating streptococci or enterococci from various specimens. the selection of a medium requires either experience or consultation. it depends on the kind of specimen, the method of cultivation (plate count or membrane filter) and whether or not the habitat is heavily contaminated with other organisms. the choice of media is made more difficult as  commercial versions of the same culture medium may vary in recipe and/or performance from producer to producer. therefore, reviewing the literature may help in the choice of medium and confirmation tests. the selectivity and productivity of some commonly used or cited media are reported here, partly based on our own experience: citrate azide tween carbonate agar (catc), kanamycin aesculin azide agar (kaa) and m-enterococcus agar (me) including earlier results  with aesculin bile azide agar (aba), and thallous acetate tetrazolium glucose agar (titg). no medium was completely selective for all group d-streptococci or for all enterococci but some media were highly selective for a single enterococcus species, e.g., for e. faecalis which serves as indicator of human pollution. confirmatory tests must be carried out when experience in the evaluation procedure is limited. selective media for enterococci should be used only after or while checking in parallel their selectivity and productivity against appropriate test organisms.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  == teichoic acids of group d streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (streptococcus suis).
AB  == immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with group d antisera. in phenol extracts from s. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with group d antiserum, was seen. this difference probably accounts for  the low yield of group d antigen from s. suis as compared with s. faecalis and s. faecium when heating at ph 2 is used for extraction. when phenol is used good yields are obtained from s. suis as well as from s. faecalis and s. faecium. lipoteichoic acids from s. faecalis and s. faecium have a backbone structure the  same as or similar to that of group a streptococcal teichoic acid. lipoteichoic acid from s. suis has a structure differing from that of s. faecalis and s. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. precipitation reactions between s. suis lipoteichoic acid and group d antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. reactions between s. bovis phenol extracts and some group d antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from s. faecalis and s. faecium were not. this may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from s. suis and s. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of s. faecalis.
