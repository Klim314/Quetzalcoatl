TI  - Intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  - Brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. This phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. We compiled a total of 60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed database was performed. Men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. Caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. In 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. Commonly implicated microorganisms included Streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group), Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens. There was an 8.3% mortality rate. Intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. This suggests that hematogenous spread is the most likely route of dissemination.
TI  - Effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (PT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: The study was conducted from December 2013 to May 2014 at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups in a 1:1 ratio: SRP+PT and SRP (control) groups. All participants underwent full-mouth SRP. PT was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. RESULTS: The clinical parameters improved in both the groups. At the follow-up assessment, PPD was significantly decreased in the SRP+PT group (P=0.00). Further, PPD and CAL showed significantly greater changes in the SRP+PT group than in the SRP group (PPD, P=0.03; CAL, P=0.04). P. gingivalis and T. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive PT seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial effects is not sufficient. Long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective PT protocol and compare the effectiveness of PT with and without exogenous photosensitizers.
TI  - Influence of the Periodontal Status on the Initial-Biofilm Formation on Titanium  Surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. The bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (Ti) surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study. The subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed Ti surfaces for 48 hours. Microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each Ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: Despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the Ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each of the study groups. However, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the Ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. Treponema denticola, Neisseria mucosa, Eikenella corrodens, and Tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the Ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis were detected on the Ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize Ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the Ti implant.
TI  - Comparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.
AB  - This study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl),  chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), Listerine(R), and high purity chlorine dioxide (Solumium, ClO2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. Antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the gold standard phenol. We investigated Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Veillonella alcalescens, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. Furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. Massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: CHX, Listerine(R) or hyper pure ClO2. Their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. The results have showed that hyper pure ClO2 solution is more effective than other currently used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and Candida yeast. In case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to CHX solution. The biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure ClO2 is significantly stronger compared to CHX and Listerine(R) after 5 min treatment. In conclusion, hyper pure ClO2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity ClO2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and in dental or oral surgery practice.
TI  - Subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. However, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of DM on periodontal subgingival microbiota. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. Subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing technique. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of TM7, Aggregatibacter, Neisseria, Gemella, Eikenella, Selenomonas, Actinomyces, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of Porphyromonas, Filifactor, Eubacterium, Synergistetes, Tannerella and Treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). Moreover, some phylotypes, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella parvula, V. dispar and Eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.
TI  - Adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (AgP), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in AgP patients. METHODS: Twenty-four AgP subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling (SC) and were then randomly assigned to SRP with systemic azithromycin or placebo. Subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after SC, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following SRP. Microbiological analysis was performed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after SC were similar in the 2 groups. When subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after SC were observed for Actinomyces gerencseriae, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Treponema denticola. During the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. For instance, Actinomyces israelli, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus gordonii, C. ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Eubacterium nodatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young AgP subjects compared to placebo. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. The aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. Also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. Samples were analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (P <0.01). Precleaning edentate biofilms had higher counts and proportions of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of Tannerella forsythia, Selenomonas noxia, and Neisseria mucosa. By day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day 7 (P <0.01). Succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. Both groups demonstrated increased proportions of S. mitis and S. oralis by day 1. N. mucosa, Veillonella parvula, and Eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. CONCLUSIONS: "Mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. Post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - Endocarditis in a large district general hospital: A study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  - Infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the United Kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. Infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. There are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the United Kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. In the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. The cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between December 2000 and January 2011 were examined. Microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. Of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with a mean age of 60.57 years. The most common organisms identified were Streptococcus species (31%), Staphylococcus aureus (27%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21%). The organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were S aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-HACEK group (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella species) pathogens such as Candida albicans. Streptococcus species and S aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the United Kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. Overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.
TI  - Relapse of polymicrobial endocarditis in an intravenous drug user.
AB  - A 26-year-old male intravenous drug user (IDU) presented twice within 6 months with relapsed polymicrobial infective endocarditis (IE) due to Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus after completing two courses of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This report points to relapsing endocarditis as a clinical entity that warrants attention in IDUs when E. corrodens or S. constellatus are causative agents of IE.
TI  - Early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. However, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately after professional cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of DNA probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. RESULTS: Succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. At 1 d, Streptococcus mitis and Neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. At 4-7 d, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella nigrescens became elevated. Subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. Increased proportions were first observed for S. mitis, followed by V. parvula and C. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by Capnocytophaga sputigena and P. nigrescens. No significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. CONCLUSION: There is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.
TI  - Visual diagnosis: swelling of the left side of the neck in an adolescent.
TI  - Influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (Ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces israelii, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus sanguinis were tested on Ti surfaces: pretreatment (PT [R(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (A [R(a) <0.8 mum]), A modified to be hydrophilic (modA), sand-blasted/acid-etched (SLA [R(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic SLA (modSLA). Disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (CM) or human saliva (HS). The total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with CM compared with the samples incubated with HS. PT, SLA, and modSLA exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in CM, whereas SLA and modSLA had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in HS. The proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: SLA and modSLA increased the proportion of species like A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of A. israelii and P. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSIONS: The initial biofilm formation and composition were affected by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - A pediatric patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - A previously healthy 6-year-old boy had continuous fever for 6 days before admission to our hospital. His general condition was good except for pyrexia. The left lobe of the thyroid gland was swollen, red, hot, and tender, and neck movement was limited. The provisional diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. We demonstrated the existence of an orifice of the left piriform sinus by esophagography in this case, and made a diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by a piriform sinus fistula in the hypopharynx. The causative organisms of acute suppurative thyroiditis include Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and alpha-streptococcus, but the organisms responsible are commonly undetectable in clinical cases. We detected Eikenella corrodens in the present patient. Although Eikenella species occasionally causes acute suppurative thyroiditis in adults, it is rare for this to happen in pediatric patients. Antibiotics were administered for 7 days. We also performed aspiration of the abscess on the 8th day of the illness. The abscess was reduced in size and tenderness was relieved after aspiration. In conclusion, if a pediatric patient has swelling, heat, tenderness, and redness of the anterior neck, we should keep in mind acute suppurative thyroiditis and the possibility of a fistula. If there is an abscess, we should immediately perform aspiration, culture, and isolation, and choose the appropriate antibiotics for the causative bacteria.
TI  - Effects of preincubation temperature on the detection of fastidious organisms in  delayed-entry samples in the BacT/ALERT 3D blood culture system.
AB  - This study evaluates the effect of preincubation on delayed-entry samples for fastidious organisms including the HACEK group, Streptococcus species, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus species and Corynebacterium species for the BacT/ALERT 3D System (bioMerieux) using the FA (aerobic) medium. Bottles were inoculated with two different concentrations (0.5 McFarland and a 1:100,000 dilution) of each organism and either loaded into the system immediately or stored at 4 degrees C, room temperature (RT) or 37 degrees C for 24 hours (h) prior to loading. The detection rate (DR) was 92.5% for bottles loaded immediately for both concentrations with a mean time to detection (TTD) of 26.7 h (standard deviation (SD): 14.7 h) for the low concentration and 9.21 h (SD: 5.3 h) for the high concentration. Preincubation at 4 degrees C did not affect the DR for either of the two concentrations in comparison to no preincubation. The DR at RT was 90.0% for the low concentration and 83.6% for the high concentration. At 37 degrees C the DR was 76.3% and 66.3% for the low and the high concentrations respectively. The average TTD was inversely correlated with the preincubation temperature. An incubation of four days was sufficient, with the exception of Eikenella corrodens and Gemella sanguinis. The serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis did not influence the TTD. Kingella kingae remained undetected. For the retrieval of the above mentioned bacteria we recommend storage of bottles at room temperature. In case of erroneous storage at 37 degrees C subcultivation is advisable. All cases with a negative result on day four should be reevaluated and eventually new material for alternative diagnostic procedures should be retrieved.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Management of human and animal bite wound infection: an overview.
AB  - Animal and human bite wounds can lead to serious infections. The organisms recovered generally originate from the biter's oral cavity and the victim's skin flora. Anaerobes were isolated from more than two thirds of human and animal bite infections. Streptococcus pyogenes is often recovered in human bites, Pasteurella multocida in animal bites, Eikenella corrodens in animal and human, Capnocytophaga spp, Neisseria weaveri, Weeksella zoohelcum, Neisseria canis, Staphylococcus intermedius, nonoxidizer-1, and eugonic oxidizer-2 in dog, Flavobacterium group in pig, and Actinobacillus spp in horse and sheep bites. Vibrio spp, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas spp can cause infections in bites associated with marine settings. In addition to local wound infection, complications include lymphangitis, local abscess, septic arthritis, tenosynovitis, and osteomyelitis. Uncommon complications include endocarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, and sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation especially in immunocompromised individuals. Wound management includes administering local care and using proper antimicrobial therapy when needed.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - The microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  - As the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. We hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. Abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. Other frequently found taxa included Olsenella uli, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121), and newly named species (Prevotella baroniae and Dialister invisus). Several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. Findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - Microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. METHODS: Bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed OLP from the Stomatology Service, Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. Samples were taken from OLP lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. The control population did not have OLP and was recruited from the student clinic. All samples were processed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher bacterial counts of Bacteroides ureolyticus (P = 0.001), Dialister species (sp.) (P = 0.006), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (P = 0.007), and Streptococcus agalactiae (P = 0.006) were found in samples taken from OLP lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of OLP. Significantly higher bacterial counts were found for Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus crispatus, Mobiluncus curtisii, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia, and S. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with OLP compared to sites in control subjects (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic differences were found between sites with OLP and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of OLP. Specifically, higher counts of staphylococci and S. agalactiae were found in OLP lesions.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - Orbital cellulitis with abscess formation following surgical treatment of canaliculitis.
AB  - The authors report a case of orbital cellulitis with abscess formation that developed after surgical management of canaliculitis. The patient developed pain, erythema, proptosis, and limited eye movements 3 days after canalicular debridement. She required urgent drainage of an orbital abscess and was treated with intravenous antibiotics for 2 weeks. Complications from surgical management of canaliculitis are unusual. Clinicians should be aware of the rare but serious risk of spread of the infection to the orbit.
TI  - Salivary microbiota of HIV-positive children and its correlation with HIV status, oral diseases, and total secretory IgA.
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and levels of salivary microorganisms in HIV-positive children, and their correlation to HIV status, oral lesions, and salivary IgA levels. DESIGN: Forty-two HIV-positive and 36 control children were clinically examined, had their saliva collected and processed for the microbiological analysis of 38 bacterial taxa by the checkerboard method, and salivary IgA quantification by ELISA. RESULTS: The majority of the species tested were more prevalent in control children than in the HIV group. Mean concentration of total salivary IgA was similar in both groups. High levels of Veillonella parvula were found in children with cheilitis and herpes. Tannerella forsythia, Eikenella Corrodens, and Propionibacterium acnes were prevalent in children with gingivitis, while Fusobacterium periodonticum, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus oralis were significantly more frequent in children with no oral lesions. Significant negative correlations between salivary IgA levels and Eubacterium nodatum and oral streptococci were observed (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HIV-seropositive children presented significantly lower prevalence and levels of several bacterial species in saliva; HIV-positive children are able to mount a mucosal immune response; HIV-seropositive children under highly active antiretroviral therapy presented low prevalence of oral lesions.
TI  - [Sepsis after pharyngitis].
AB  - We report about a 36-year-old patient, who developped 4 days after a pharyngitis  a sepsis with high temperature und recurrent vomiting. The chest radiograph showed multiple pulmonary abcesses and in the computed tomography additionally a thrombosis was detected in a communicans vein between the right jugularis anterior and the jugularis interna. This disease is commonly known as Lemierre Syndrom. The most common pathogen is the Fusobacterium necrophorum, but other bacteria of the normal oropharyngeal flora can also be the causative organisms. Given an adequate antibiotic therapy and supportive care, the prognosis is favourable.
TI  - Susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty strains of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin-3. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. Although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to LL-37 than the others (p=0.004). The susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on the species but not on the strains. The periodontopathic bacteria, especially Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003). In addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - An in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. In this study, a quantitative Taqman PCR assay (QPCR) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species in the formation of the oral biofilm. In addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. With this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16S rDNA sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (ISR) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. Among the target organisms were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Micromonas micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Tannerella forsythensis, and Veillonella parvula. Primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. The relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. Brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. This new broad spectrum QPCR assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Eikenella corrodens in head and neck infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eikenella corrodens (E. corrodens) is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus that originally was thought to be an attenuated and indigenous bacterium. In recent years, a number of reports have documented that E. corrodens can be a potential pathogen not only in immunocompromised patients but also in hosts with normal immunity. We herein study E. corrodens infections of the head and neck encountered in our department. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients treated in our department for E. corrodens infections of the head and neck were retrospectively analyzed. Microbial specimens were subjected to light microscopic examination, aerobic culture using chocolate and sheep blood agar media, and anaerobic culture using Brucella HK agar medium. Cultured bacteria were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests by means of the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: There were 16 males and 6 females with an average age of 29.9 years. Two patients had malignancy, while the other patients had no particular risk factors or underlying diseases. Infected sites were the ear in 6 cases, pharynx in 12 cases (tonsil in 10 cases), paranasal sinuses in 3 cases, and salivary gland in 1 case. Seventeen patients suffered polymicrobial infections. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus were the most frequently detected pathogens coexisting with E. corrodens, and mixed infections of E. corrodens and Streptococcus milleri group bacteria were prone to form abscesses. Isolated E. corrodens was susceptible to third-generation cephems (MIC90 = 0.15-0.25 microg/ml), carbapenems (MIC90 < or = 0.15 microg/ml), and new quinolones (MIC90 < or = 0.15 microg/ml), and resistant to oxacillin (MIC90 > 8 microg/ml), cefazolin (MIC90 > 4 microg/ml), macrolides (MIC90 = 4-8 microg/ml), and clindamycin (MIC90 > 4 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: E. corrodens infections of the head and neck occur most frequently in the tonsil even in hosts with normal immunity. Coexistence with Streptococcus milleri group bacteria and the use of ineffective antibiotics can be exacerbating factors. First-choice drugs for E. corrodens infections should be third-generation cephems, carbapenems, or new quinolones.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
TI  - Thigh abscess caused by Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus intermedius: a case report.
AB  - A 35-year-old Chinese female has a large thigh abscess without a clear source. No underlying diseases were revealed in the patient. The combination of clindamycin and cefazolin or vancomycin was administered but without a clinical response. Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus intermedius were isolated from puncture drainage. Then, ceftriaxone was administered and a surgery of incision and further draining was carried. Eventually, the patient recovered. To our knowledge, this is the first case of thigh abscess in a previous healthy adult.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in atheromatous plaques by quantitative PCR.
AB  - This is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial DNA from ten species, including periodontal species and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We examined 129 samples of DNA extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from ten different species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola and C. pneumoniae. All determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods employing SYBR Green. Species from the Bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. Almost half of the samples contained DNA from A. a. and C. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. S. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. The proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic DNA. The data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. We conclude that DNA from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of C. pneumoniae to the inflammation may be minimal.
TI  - A new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. Most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' DNA-DNA hybridization method. METHODS: Fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). One diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. RESULTS: Twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). A significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, and Eikenella corrodens). Of the species in the new panel only Prevotella tannerae, Filifactor alocis, and Porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that P. tannerae, F. alocis, and P. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.
TI  - Causative microorganisms in surgically treated pediatric hand infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: The causative organisms in many pediatric musculoskeletal infections are distinct from their adult counterparts. We investigated the organisms found in surgically treated hand infections in the pediatric population. METHODS: We reviewed the hospital charts and computer records of all patients who had surgical intervention for infections of the forearm, wrist, and hand from 1996 through 2002 at The Children's Hospital of Boston. RESULTS: Thirty-eight surgical procedures were performed on 31 children for 32 different upper-extremity infections. One patient was treated for 2 separate infections. In the 32 primary procedures 7 cultures grew mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms, 19 grew aerobic organisms only, 6 grew no organisms, and 2 patients had no cultures. One culture from a secondary surgery was positive for Candida parapsilosis. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 15 of the primary cases and was the primary organism in 12. Five of 7 mixed infections were associated with paronychia; 2 of the paronychial infections were complicated by flexor tenosynovitis. Chronic nail biting caused 2 infections and 1 was associated with thumb sucking. CONCLUSIONS: In the adult population S aureus is the primary organism cultured in 50% to 80% of cases and anaerobic or mixed infection may occur in upward of 29% of patients. In this series S aureus was the primary organism in only 37%. Group A Streptococcus pyogenes was present in 20% of cases. The percentage of children with a mixed aerobic/anaerobic infection was similar to that found in adults; however, the presumed route of introduction was digital sucking/biting. Based on the number of anaerobic/mixed infections without predisposing factors we recommend a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen including anaerobic coverage as the initial antibiotic in the setting of pediatric hand infections.
TI  - Streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  - Previously, we reported that intracellular Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. In this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using the same double-labeling techniques to identify Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, oral Campylobacter species, Eikenella corrodens, Treponema denticola, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. All those species were found within buccal cells. In every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. Streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (G. adiacens). This is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.
TI  - Eikenella corrodens from a brain abscess.
AB  - A 2-year-old boy with underlying congenital cyanotic heart disease presented with seizures and fever and was found to have bilateral parietal cerebral abscesses. Drainage of the pus from the abscesses was done in stages; on the day of admission, four days after admission and 3 weeks after admission. Although the pus from the first drainage did not grow any organisms, the pus from the second drainage on the fourth day of admission yielded a mixed growth of Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus milleri. Following the second drainage of pus, the child was noted to have mild weakness (grade 3/5) and increased tone in the left upper limb. Three weeks after admission, due to recurring fever, further neurological signs and findings of an enlarging right cerebral abscess on a repeat CT scan, a third drainage was carried out. However no growth was obtained from this specimen. This patient was managed both surgically and with appropriate antibiotics. Over the next four months, serial CT scans revealed gradual resolution of the abscesses with disappearance of the surrounding oedema. The child showed gradual recovery of his left sided weakness with resolution of tone and reflexes to normal.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - [Brain abscess caused by Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus intermedius associated with bowel carcinoid tumour].
TI  - Tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian population.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. For each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Tannerella forsythensis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponoma denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and Streptococcus intermedius. Two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). RESULTS: The prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. At score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. The depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. When the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: No major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.
TI  - Effect of khat chewing on 14 selected periodontal bacteria in sub- and supragingival plaque of a young male population.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The habit of chewing khat (Catha edulis) for its amphetamine-like effects is highly prevalent in Yemen and east Africa, and has expanded to Western countries. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence and levels of 14 periodontal bacteria in gingival plaque of khat chewers and khat nonchewers, as well as of khat chewing sides and khat nonchewing sides. METHODS: A total of 408 sub- and supragingival plaque samples were collected from 51 young males (29 khat chewers and 22 khat nonchewers; age range 19-28 years) and analyzed using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical parameters were recorded for all teeth at six sites per tooth. RESULTS: Streptococcus intermedius and Veillonella parvula were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival plaque of chewers, which also showed significantly higher levels of V. parvula and Eikenella corrodens. Similar results were found for the subgingival plaque of the chewing sides compared to the nonchewing sides. However, there was a significantly higher prevalence and higher levels of Tannerella forsythia in the subgingival plaque of the nonchewing sides. No significant differences were observed for the supragingival plaque between the two study groups. There was a significantly lower prevalence of Capnocytophaga gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum in the khat chewing sides, and higher levels of V. parvula and Actinomyces israelii. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that khat chewing induces a microbial profile that is not incompatible with gingival health.
TI  - Periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (PLBW)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. There is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence PLBW infants. Recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for PLBW. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and PLBW by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. METHODS: Clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum. Subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. In all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. Thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. Statistical methods included Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). Mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than in the cases (p<0.05). The occurrence rates of P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and S. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). According to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, P. micros and C. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of PLBW (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while P. nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, P. micros and C. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for PLBW, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of PLBW. Further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and PLBW.
TI  - Differences in the subgingival microbiota of Swedish and USA subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. METHOD: One hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (N Sweden=79; USA=79) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, BOP, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=4345). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in Swedish than American subjects: Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); Streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); Eikenella corrodens (1.7, 1.0); Tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and Prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). Leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in American (5.5) than Swedish subjects (3.0). Cluster analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. Twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. Five clusters were dominated by American subjects and 2 clusters by Swedish subjects. Fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the Swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by high proportions of A. naeslundii genospecies 1, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythensis and P. melaninogenica. Other clusters were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces gerencseriae, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eubacterium saburreum, L. buccalis and Neisseria mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. The heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the American subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the American subjects sampled.
TI  - [Bite wound infections].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The lifetime risk of experiencing a bite wound, human or animal, is approximately 50%, and bite wounds account for approximately 1% of all visits to emergency departments. The majority of bite wounds are inflicted by dogs and cats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of bite wound infections is presented. RESULTS: The most common pathogens associated with bite wounds are Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus species, Pasteurella multocida, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and anaerobic bacteria. Sporadically other pathogens are isolated from bite wounds. Human bites differ from animal bites by higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and Eikenella corrodens. INTERPRETATION: It is important to be aware of the possibility of complicating infections following bite wounds, particularly after cat bites. Phenoxymethyl penicillin should be the drug of choice in treatment of infections associated with cat and dog bites. However, in case of slow recovery or no improvement, simultaneous lymphadenopathy or pneumonia, S. aureus or Francisella tularensis should be suspected; ciprofloxacin is recommended. For human bite infections the recommend treatment is phenoxymethyl penicillin in combination with penicillinase-stable penicillin.
TI  - Modified oligosaccharides as potential dental plaque control materials.
AB  - Metabolic acids produced by oral pathogens demineralize tooth surfaces, leading to dental caries. Glucosyltransferases are the key factor in this process. We synthesized various modified oligosaccharides and tested them for their inhibitory effects on glucosyltransferase activity. Oligosaccharides were produced using a mixed-culture fermentation of Lipomyces starkeyi and Leuconostoc mesenteroides and then further modified as iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides. Iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides reduced glucosyltransferase activity of Streptococci from 17% to 43% and prevented the formation of insoluble biomass on the surface of glass vials or stainless steel wires in the presence of sucrose. They also reduced the growth and acid productions of oral pathogens including S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcmitans.
TI  - Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following pleural empyema owing to Boerhaave's syndrome.
AB  - Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is reported in a 14-year-old male patient associated with a pleural empyema caused by an esophageal perforation. During the hospital course, the patient experienced an episode of cardiac arrest, raising the question of hypoxic-ischemic cerebral injury, but the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical course were most consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. After a course of methylprednisolone, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and bilateral chest tube placement, the patient recovered with only mild residual deficits, along with resolution of his MRI findings.
TI  - [Acute neurological symptoms in a 6-year-old patient with cyanotic congenital heart disease].
TI  - Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  - Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Antibody-based diagnostic for 'refractory' periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: About 10-15% of US adults are 'refractory' to therapy for chronic periodontitis. Recently, studies suggest that these patients have elevated lysine decarboxylase activity in the sulcular microbiota. The aim of this study was to determine whether an elevated IgG antibody response to lysine decarboxylase, alone or with antibody to other bacterial antigens and baseline clinical measurements, would predict 'refractory' patients with high accuracy. METHODS: Chronic periodontitis patients were treated using scaling and root planing (SRP) followed by maintenance SRP and 3-monthly re-examinations. If there was a loss of mean full mouth attachment or more than three sites appeared with > 2.5 mm new loss within a year, the subjects were re-treated (modified Widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline). If attachment loss as above recurred, the subjects were 'refractory'. Baseline clinical measurements and specific antibody responses were used in a logistic regression model to predict 'refractory' subjects. RESULTS: Antibody to a peptide portion of lysine decarboxylase (HKL-Ab) and baseline bleeding on probing (BOP) prevalence measurements predicted attachment loss 3 months after initial therapy [pIAL = loss (0) or gain (1)]. IgG antibody contents to a purified antigen from Actinomyces spp. (A-Ab) and streptococcal d-alanyl glycerol lipoteichoic acid (S-Ab) were related in 'refractory' patients (R2 = 0.37, p < 0.01). From the regression equation, the relationship between the antibodies was defined as linear (pLA/S-Ab = 0) or non-linear pLA/S-Ab = 1). Using pLA/S-Ab, pIAL and age, a logistic regression equation was derived from 48 of the patients. Of 59 subjects, 37 had 2-4 mm attachment loss and were assigned as 'refractory' or successfully treated with 86% accuracy. CONCLUSION: HKL-Ab facilitated an accurate prediction of therapeutic outcome in subjects with moderate periodontitis.
TI  - Stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. Noradrenaline and adrenaline, which are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. The aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. We established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees C. We assessed organism growth by optical density (OD(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. Test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. We observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. The most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in Actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), Actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), Eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and Campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). We also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for Porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and Bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). Responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. Individual organisms from different microbial complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. Such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16S ribosomal DNA bacterial genes from DNA isolated from advanced noma lesions of four Nigerian children were PCR amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. A total of 67 bacterial species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. Nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. Other known species that were detected included Achromobacter spp., Afipia spp., Brevundimonas diminuta, Capnocytophaga spp., Cardiobacterium sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., Gemella haemoylsans, and Neisseria spp. Phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera Eubacterium, Flavobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Porphyromonas and the related Streptococcus salivarius and genera Sphingomonas and TREPONEMA: Since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. Several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and Fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. However, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.
TI  - Potential hazard of wound licking.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in Sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the periodontal status of patients with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of SS patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. METHODS: 8 primary SS and 10 secondary SS patients were examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. All patients were diagnosed by the European Community Criteria. Control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. The comparison of clinical status was made in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. Microbiological assays of the subgingival dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (Periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (PA) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, Streptococcus oralis). RESULTS: The occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. No significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary SS patients for the PA test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. CONCLUSION: No significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or secondary SS patients compared with that of control subjects. The results of the present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with SS do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.
TI  - [Acute subdural abscess due to mixed infection of Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus].
AB  - Eikenella corrodens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod that frequently exists as part of normal human flora in the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract. Recently, E. corrodens is reported as a rare causative agent of empyematic lesion. We report a case of 10-year-old girl with acute subdural abscess. She developed a high grade fever, swelling of the left periorbital area, right sided partial seizure and hemiplegia. Brain CT and MRI showed left parietal subdural abscess. Because intravenous antibiotic therapy was not effective enough and her neurological symptoms progressed, surgical drainage was performed in order to decompress the brain and to determine the causative agents. Through careful bacterial cultures, E. corrodens and Streptococcus constellatus were detected from the subdural abscess. After the drainage operation and a three week course of appropriate chemotherapy, the abscess completely disappeared and no sequela remained.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical significance of the Streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  - Few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. Although Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. Few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. We studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000. The Streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by Eikenella corrodens (9.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and S. pyogenes (3.2%). The S. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of Streptococcus constellatus, S. intermedius, and S. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. These species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. To adequately culture the S. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. Since hemolytic patterns of the S. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. We found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. Although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the S. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. As antibiotics began being used widely, normal flora such as the S. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. STUDY DESIGN: Pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: The results of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 DNA probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. The number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). Eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one DNA probe. The most prevalent species found were: Bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); Porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); Streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), Prevotella intermedia (22.2%), Prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and Eikenella corrodens (18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.
TI  - Adrenomedullin expression in pathogen-challenged oral epithelial cells.
AB  - Adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide, is expressed by many surface epithelial cells and, previously, we have demonstrated that adrenomedullin has antimicrobial activity. The oral cavity contains an epithelium that is permanently colonized by microflora, yet infections in a host are rare. We exposed oral keratinocytes to whole, live cells from four microorganisms commonly isolated from the oral cavity, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Eikenella corrodens. There was upregulation of protein and gene expression in these cells in response to bacterial suspensions, but not with the yeast, Candida albicans. We propose there is a potential role for microbial products in enhancing mucosal defense mechanisms and that adrenomedullin participates in the prevention of local infection, thus contributing to host defense mechanisms.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. METHODS: The study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. Twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (AP), six localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. The samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. RESULTS: Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in AP and RPP patients, while Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens were associated with AP, LJP and RPP patients. The other bacterial species, including Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp. and Eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.
TI  - Optimisation of the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - This paper reviews currently established guidelines for the prevention and treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Endocarditis remains a life-threatening disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention of endocarditis, whenever possible, is therefore very important. In an individual with endocarditis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to good patient outcome. The guidelines discussed here are largely based on those issued by the American Heart Association. While most cases of endocarditis are not attributable to an invasive procedure, certain procedures are associated with bacteraemia by organisms commonly associated with endocarditis, and antibacterial prophylaxis is recommended before such procedures. Patient cardiac conditions are stratified into high, moderate and negligible risk categories based on potential outcome if endocarditis develops. For oral, dental, respiratory tract, and oesophageal procedures (most often associated with viridans streptococci) the standard antibacterial regimen is oral amoxicillin. For gastrointestinal and genitourinary procedures (most often associated with enterococci), parenteral antibacterials are most often recommended. For high-risk patients, intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin (or vancomycin and gentamicin in penicillin-allergic individuals) is recommended. For moderate risk patients, an option of oral amoxicillin or parenteral ampicillin is offered. Treatment of bacterial endocarditis is guided by identification of the causative micro-organism. Approximately 80% of cases of endocarditis are due to the gram-positive cocci: streptococci and staphylococci. Other gram-positive organisms include enterococci (predominantly Enterococcusfaecalis and E. faecium) and the HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus [Haemophilus] actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae). In general, for uncomplicated cases of endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci or Streptococcus bovis 4 weeks of benzylpenicillin (or ceftriaxone) is the preferred regimen for most patients aged >65 years. A 2-week course of treatment can be used when gentamicin is added, in patients at low risk for adverse events caused by gentamicin therapy. When endocarditis is caused by strains of viridans streptococci or S. bovis relatively resistant to penicillin, or by enterococci, both benzylpenicillin and gentamicin are recommended. For staphylococcal endocarditis on native heart valves, nafcillin or oxacillin with or without gentamicin is the preferred regimen. In prosthetic valve staphylococcal endocarditis, nafcillin (or oxacillin) with rifampicin and gentamicin is recommended. For all of the above situations, vancomycin is recommended for the patient allergic to penicillin (or methicillin). Finally, consideration of out-of-hospital therapy in selected patients is discussed.
TI  - Molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  - Fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. Bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. Fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. Type I fimbriae and P pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. Type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type II secretion system. Curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. Fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. Oral pathogens, such as Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. These fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens have Type 4-like fimbriae, whereas P. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. To date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. The putative major fimbrial subunits, FimA and FimP of A. naeslundii and Fap1 of S. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. The presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in Fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. Based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both S. parasanguis and A. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. The model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. Silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. Copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. In contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/mL produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (CFU)/mL or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. A silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/mL produced log10 reductions in CFU/mL of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against P. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket. These results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Increased susceptibility to gingival colonization by specific HACEK microbes in children with congenital heart disease.
AB  - It is well established that infective endocarditis (IE) involving the HACEK (Hemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacter, Eikenella, Kingella) group of microbes occurs in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD) and in those with prosthetic grafts. Dental caries and gingival disease have been presumed to be the focus of microbial shedding. The purpose of this study was to determine if children with CHD had a more severe gingival inflammatory condition and harbored the HACEK group of microbes to a greater extent than normal children. Two groups of 12 age and sex matched children were selected for this study. The experimental group consisted of twelve children with CHD, 1-1/2 to 8 years of age. The control group consisted of 12 healthy children 2 to 8 years of age. Each child had a gingival index score recorded as described by Massler. Subgingival cultures were obtained. Gingival samples were cultured for HACEK microbes and total Streptococcus (spp) using standard techniques. Fisher's exact test was performed with significance defined at P < 0.05. Children with CHD had more severe gingival inflammatory index than the control group (P < 0.05). 8/12 CHD patient had Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) as compared with 2/12 controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, all cyanotic CHD patients (4/4) had A.a. whereas, only 2/12 controls did (P < 0.05). 4/12 CHD patients harbored Eikenella corrodens (E.c.) compared to 1/12 controls (N.S.). There was no significant difference in colonization with E.c. or A.a. between cyanotic and acyanotic patients. No significant difference in total Streptococcus (spp) was found between the two groups. This study suggests that children with CHD have a more severe gingival inflammatory index and are colonized with specific HACEK microbes more so than normal children.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Testing meningococcal vaccines for mitogenicity and superantigenicity.
AB  - Proteins with intrinsic mitogenic properties are widely represented in prokaryotes, such as in different Streptococcus species (1-3), Candida albicans (4), and Eikenella corrodens (5). Specifically, several bacterial porins of Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and pathogenic Neisseria species have been shown to induce nonspecific proliferation of lymphocytes (6-12).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of GAR-936 against aerobic and anaerobic animal and human bite wound pathogens.
AB  - GAR-936 is a new semisynthetic glycylcycline with a broad antibacterial spectrum, including tetracycline-resistant strains. The in vitro activities of GAR-936, minocycline, doxycycline, tetracycline, moxifloxacin, penicillin G, and erythromycin were determined by agar dilution methods against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic strains of bacteria (including Pasteurella, Eikenella, Moraxella, Bergeyella, Neisseria, EF-4, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Actinomyces) isolated from infected human and animal bite wounds in humans, including strains resistant to commonly used antimicrobials. GAR-936 was very active, with an MIC at which 90% of the strains are inhibited (MIC(90)) of < or =0.25 microg/ml, against all aerobic gram-positive and -negative strains, including tetracycline-resistant strains of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, except for Eikenella corrodens (MIC(90), < or =4 microg/ml). GAR-936 was also very active against all anaerobic species, including tetracycline-, doxycycline-, and minocycline-resistant strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides tectum, and Peptostreptococcus spp., with an MIC(90) of < or =0.25 microg/ml. Erythromycin- and moxifloxacin-resistant fusobacteria were susceptible to GAR-936, with an MIC(90) of 0.06 microg/ml.
TI  - Identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  - The mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter junii and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria perflava/sicca and Neisseria mucosa and gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Three Streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, Kingella denitrificans, M. catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, N. perflava/sicca, and N. mucosa at similar frequencies. The mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
TI  - Infrarenal aortic rupture in association with a contiguous polymicrobial intraabdominal abscess including Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - Aortic rupture in association with a contiguous intraabdominal abscess is rare. We report an unusual case of aortic rupture in association with a polymicrobial abscess and review the related literature. Cultures grew Eikenella corrodens, a rare intraabdominal pathogen, as well as betahemolytic streptococcus and S. viridans. The patient was successfully managed by aortic ligation followed by an extraanatomic bypass.
TI  - Isolation of Eikenella corrodens from polymicrobial hepatic abscess: report of one case.
AB  - Eikenella corrodens is a rare cause of hepatic abscess. We report a case of a hepatic abscess caused by (1) Bacteroides fragilis, (2) Streptococcus constellatus and (3) E. corrodens, which illustrates potential problems of antibiotic coverage due to the presence of Eikenella species. The infection followed an episode of acute gastroenteritis and the clinical course appeared indolent evolving over one week. Besides empirical antibiotics, initial percutaneous aspiration was performed and yielded pus which grew E. corrodens concomitantly with Streptococcus species. E. corrodens was sensitive to penicillin but resistant to clindamycin and metronidazole. But B. fragilis was resistant to penicillin. So the antibiotics were switched to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Unfortunately fever persisted and the abscess increased in size. Therefore echo-guided percutaneous drainage with pigtail catheter was installed. Fever subsided 5 days later. After 21 days treatment of antibiotics, the patient was discharged in good condition despite having some sterile fluid in the residual abscess cavity. Two months after discharge the follow-up echogram confirmed complete resolution of the residual abscess. This patient shows us the existence of E. corrodens in pediatric patients, especially when the hepatic abscess is very likely from the spread of an oral or abdominal infection.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in Behcet's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. Recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with Behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with Behcet's disease than in controls (P <0.001-0.05). In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with Behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in Behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (II). Effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). Saliva samples as well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. All subjects received full mouth SRP and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. Saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. Control subjects were sampled at the same time points. Samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in PRAS Ringer's solution and plated on enriched Trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. Microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the Mann Whitney test and over time within each group using the Quade test. The mean % (+/-SEM) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to 25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. In saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. The % of resistant isolates did not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. For all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Streptococcus gordonii, Eikenella corrodens and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. Doxycycline resistant strains of these species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. Despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.
TI  - [Eikenella corrodens: five year experience in a general hospital].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eikenella corrodens is a Gram negative bacillus that colonizes oropharyngeal and digestive mucous membranes. It is difficult to isolate in the laboratory. This might be the reason why its implication in different types of infection is not well known. We report a five year experience in a general hospital. METHODS: Charts of 125 infections have been retrospectively reviewed. No selective medium was employed for the isolation. RESULTS: Infections were related to oral cavity in 68 patients (54%) and to gastrointestinal tract in 45 (36%); in 12 no clear source could be found. The prevailing infections were: postsurgical 32, apendiceal 22, abscesses 22, and traumatic wounds 12. Seventy two percent of the patients were adults and 93% were hospitalized. Eighteen patients had a neoplasia, 6 were diabetic, and 3 had some kind of immunodeficiency. Etiology was polymicrobial in 91% of the cases, the prevailing association being with Streptococcus spp. (74%). Only 15 patients had a pure culture, 11 of which had received previous antibiotic treatment. The most serious infections were a subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis, a mediastinitis following a mouth floor abscess, and a peritonitis with pleural empyema preceded by an hepatic abscess. The three were polymicrobial. Outcome was always satisfactory with no associated death. CONCLUSIONS: The origin of these infections is almost always clearly related with its habitat, but their spectrum is wide. Polymicrobial condition of most of them makes diagnosis as well as interpretation of its clinical meaning difficult. Nevertheless, association of E. corrodens with serious or slow healing infections fully justifies the efforts towards its isolation and the choice of antibiotics to which it is susceptible.
TI  - Characterization of gram-positive tellurite resistance encoded by the Streptococcus pneumoniae tehB gene.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium which is naturally resistant to tellurite. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a homologue of the Escherichia coli tellurite resistance gene tehB from S. pneumoniae. It encoded a protein of 284 amino acids which is 86 residues longer than E. coli TehB, but similar in size to Haemophilus influenzae TehB and Eikenella corrodens hemagglutinin (Hag1) as well as homologues from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. The S. pneumoniae TehB displayed 46-58% identity (52-68% similarity) to these proteins. The results in this study showed that the S. pneumoniae tehB alone not only conferred on E. coli high level resistance to tellurite, but also caused filamentous morphology in E. coli.
TI  - Neutrophil response and microbiological findings around teeth and dental implants.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. The 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. Crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and 3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. All sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. The samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. The elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. The antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. Gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. Edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. No correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. This study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.
TI  - Microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  - Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. Aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (AST) is one of the components of GCF that is released as a result of cell death. In this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (EOP) patients were first examined for the AST levels in GCF by the Periogard periodontal tissue monitor. To be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 AST positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (AST+, CIC+) and 1 AST negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (AST-, CIC-). In 15 EOP patients who met the entry criteria, 30 AST+, CIC+ sites (1st group) and 19 AST-, CIC- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. Certain microbial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as Actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. Parallel to the AST levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). Within the scope of this study, AST activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. These findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of the AST test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those that are inflamed, but not progressing.
TI  - Benign superior vena cava syndrome due to suppurative mediastinal lymphadenitis:  anterior mediastinoscopic management.
AB  - The benign superior vena cava syndrome is an uncommon medical emergency. We describe a case of the superior vena cava syndrome caused by suppurative mediastinal lymphadenitis. The organisms isolated from various cultures were group C beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Fusobacterium species, Corynebacterium species, Eikenella corrodens, and Streptococcus milleri. These anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract and the oral cavity. Anterior mediastinoscopy through the right parasternal approach was used to drain the anterior mediastinal abscess and to establish the etiologic factor.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profile of Papillon-Lefevre patients assessed by DNA-probes.
AB  - The prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridisation in a group of 12 Saudi-Arabian adolescents with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. A total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. The patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. All 12 patients harboured the putative bacterial pathogens P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. micros and S. intermedius while T. denticola, B. forsythus, P. nigrescens, E. corrodens, S. noxia and C. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. P. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for A. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. A number of the investigated species (B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. intermedia, C rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. On the other hand, bacteria such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were infrequently encountered at high levels in these subgingival samples. In conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a PLS-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  - This study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. Microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA-based PCR identification methods. Streptococcal and Actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. In decreasing order of prevalence, Fusobacterium, enteric rods, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga, Propionibacterium, yeasts, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. The cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. PCR detection showed C. rectus and Eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. In decreasing order of prevalence, PCR identified Treponema denticola, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. Tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. It appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.
TI  - "Checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The present study compared the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect to the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled DNA probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial test panels. We found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data. If the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. The use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87. The checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. It was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.
TI  - [Misunderstood symptoms in patients with infectious endocarditis].
AB  - Infectious endocarditis was diagnosed in four patients, men aged 18, 44, 35 and 22; the bacteria involved were Streptococcus viridans, Eikenella corrodens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, respectively. In all patients mycotic aneurysms were observed which had led to seemingly unrelated neurological or abdominal complaints. In one patient an aneurysm of the A. cerebri media resolved in two years, another patient died following fatal bleeding of a ruptured aneurysm in the A. hepatica propria. Mycotic aneurysms may be found in all parts of the body. This complication is often diagnosed too late because it is not considered.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. There are three myeloperoxidase isoforms: MPO I, MPO II and MPO III. We examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Streptococcus sanguis. Isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-A-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. Most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in MPO I and diminished in MPO III. Exceptionally, serum-opsonized A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. Because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests based upon myeloperoxidase.
TI  - Chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - In children, sinusitis is a common, generally uncomplicated, and self limiting disease which drops with age. The diagnosis is difficult because of relatively non specific signs and symptoms that overlap with viral upper respiratory infection and allergy. Plain paranasal sinus radiographs are not adequate, in determining the extent of involvement in recurrent or chronic sinusitis and so CT scan has become the standard. Viral illness appears to be the most common predisposing factor. Immune defects (mainly IG2 and IGA) may exist in a significant percentage of children. The role of allergy seems less important. With advances in the genetic field of cystic fibrosis, genetic factors are advocated in chronic or recurrent sinusitis. The most common bacterial pathogens in pediatric sinusitis patients are SP (Streptococcus Pneumoniae), HI (Hemophilus Influenza) and MC (Moraxella Catarrhalis). Other less frequent bacterial species include group A streptococcus, group C streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus, moraxella species and Eikenella corrodens. Respiratory anaerobes are not common. Antibiotics resistant to the action of the beta-lactamase are the cornerstone in medical treatment. In recurrent acute sinusitis prophylactic antimicrobials may be helpful. The indication for surgery remains controversial. To date, we have no prospective studies comparing surgical to medical therapy in order to guide us in deciding surgical indication. It is therefore recommended to follow a conservative track and to limit surgical procedures in children with suppurative complications, nasal obstruction from polyposis or refractory sinusitis aggravating chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma.
TI  - Deep neck infections.
TI  - Hepatic abscess due to Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus milleri: implications for antibiotic therapy.
AB  - We report a case of intrahepatic abscess involving infection with Eikenella corrodens. The organism proved difficult to isolate and would not have been covered by some empirical regimens used in penicillin-allergic patients.
TI  - Interactions between Eikenella corrodens and 'Streptococcus milleri-group' organisms: possible mechanisms of pathogenicity in mixed infections.
AB  - Interactions between the 'Streptococcus milleri-group' organisms (SMG; S. intermedius, S. constellatus and S. anginosus) and Eikenella corrodens were investigated. Coaggregation reactions occurred frequently between S. anginosus (83% of strain combinations) or S. constellatus (87%) and E. corrodens isolates, but were infrequent between S. intermedius and E. corrodens (28%). No enhancement of enzyme activities against lipid, phosphate, peptide and saccharide substrates tested were detected with combinations of species in comparison to the species alone. Exponential growth of S. constellatus and S. intermedius, in mixed culture with E. corrodens, occurred within 6h post inoculation, in comparison to 25h without E. corrodens. No growth stimulation of S. anginosus was observed. It is concluded that both coaggregation and growth stimulation occur between E. corrodens and SMG isolates, and may be important mechanisms in the establishment of mixed infections involving these bacteria.
TI  - An Eikenella corrodens toxin detected by plaque toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Bacterial plaque from the gingival region of teeth contains cytotoxic agents which lyse undifferentiated human HL60 cells. A small panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was found to abrogate much of this activity and to detect antigens in certain strains of Streptococcus mitis and Eikenella corrodens. The aim of this study was to determine whether these bacterial antigens might be involved in HL60 cells cytolysis. Saline extracts were obtained by homogenizing washed, stationary-phase cells in 65 mM NaCl with a tight-fitting Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The extracts of E. corrodens were toxic to HL60 cells, whereas similar extracts of S. mitis were nontoxic. Adding plaque toxin-neutralizing MAb 3hE5 blocked the toxic effect of E. corrodens extract S. mitis extracts contained a single, strongly reactive antigen of 140 kDa (s140K antigen) detected on Western blots (immunoblots) by three MAbs from the panel. Rabbit antibodies raised to this antigen excised from the gel (anti-s140K serum) detected larger antigens in addition to s140K. E. corrodens extracts contained a number of antigens detected by the MAbs. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from anti-s140K serum by passage through DE52 cellulose. A 100-fold excess (by weight) of the purified IgG to E. corrodens protein specifically cross-precipitated an 80-kDa antigen plus a nonantigenic 16-kDa protein, presumably attached noncovalently. The remaining supernatant fraction had no toxic activity. A similar ratio of control IgG (from nonimmunized rabbits) did not precipitate these proteins, and the supernatant fraction had the same activity as the extract not treated with IgG. The proteins of 80 and 16 kDa were also detected in the anti-s140K immunoprecipitate by rabbit IgG antibodies to E. corrodens whole cells. The 80-kDa antigen, alone or complexed with the 16-kDa protein, may be involved in mediating the toxic activity in E. corrodens and plaque extracts.
TI  - Rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  - Eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate tests. Identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. Characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five Porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting Prevotella species, Bacteroides forsythus, three Capnocytophaga species, six Actinomyces species, four Propionibacterium species, and eight Streptococcus species. Two mannoside isomers differentiated Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae. In addition to Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus, and Capnocytophaga species, Fusobacterium alocis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces meyeri, and Bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. Fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. The method was ideal for rapidly obtaining presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as SDS-PAGE.
TI  - [Various new pathogens in pneumonia].
AB  - The table summarizes the many newly recognized agents causing lower respiratory tract infections: gram + cocci, Streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci; gram-rods, acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Eikenella corrodens; Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs, intracellular organisms and viruses. Some details are given in four chapters: Pneumococci resistant to penicillin G which must be detected and impose new therapeutic strategies; Chlamydia pneumoniae with its difficulties for the diagnosis and the absence of standardized therapeutic trials; Streptococcus pyogenes with a recrudescence of severe and invasive infections, TSS and virulence factors; the pulmonary Hantavirus syndrome with 105 patients recognized (mortality 52%) in the USA and Canada, the homeland of the deermouse (Peromiscus maniculatus).
TI  - Growth differences of Capnocytophaga canimorsus strains and some other fastidious organisms on various Columbia-based blood agar media.
AB  - Three human isolates of Capnocytophaga canimorsus from blood cultures showed no growth when cultivated on sheep blood agar plates based on BBL Columbia agar base, whereas the same three strains grew excellently on sheep blood agar plates based on Difco Columbia agar bases No. 2 or EH. Two of the three strains also grew well on blood agar plates based on bioMerieux Columbia agar. Strains that grew better on either Difco or bioMerieux Columbia based blood agar plates were found among Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Kingella kingae, Lactobacillus sp., and Streptococcus adjacens, but these strains were never lost when cultivated on BBL Columbia agar plates. One strain of Lactobacillus failed to grow on Difco Columbia No. 2 agar and showed best growth on bioMerieux Columbia agar. Strains of Corynebacterium G 2, Corynebacterium afermentans and Streptococcus adjacens showed poor growth on chocolate agar when compared to blood agar media. Microbiologists should be aware of the importance of media formulations for optimal recovery of fastidious organisms.
TI  - Cross-reactivity between human sialyl Lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of sialy-Lewis(x) (sLe(x); Neu5Ac alpha 2-3 Gal beta 1-4) (Fuc alpha 1-3) GlcNAc-R) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sLe(x) monoclonal antibody SNH-3 (mAb SNH-3; IgM class). mAb SNH-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of Streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. Our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sLe(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. We propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sLe(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events leading to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  - A total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% Gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. A subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. Subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. At baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2) select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. There were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters measured at the 7 different time points. The control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable Neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of P. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. After 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. Analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly Veillonella dispar. This study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Outpatient treatment of endocarditis in a clinic-based program in Argentina.
AB  - The major cost in the treatment of infective endocarditis (IE) is the length of hospitalization required for the administration of intravenous antibiotics. This can be reduced by substituting shorter regimens and by the introduction of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT). Careful selection of patients is vital for the success of OPAT in IE. The patients should be hemodynamically stable and without clinical complications. The delivery of OPAT for IE followed a clinical and home-based program involving an endocarditis team whose members included an infectious diseases physician, a microbiologist, a cardiologist and a nurse trained in intravenous techniques. Among the antimicrobial agents used in OPAT of IE, single-agent ceftriaxone for four weeks followed by a short course of amoxicillin or ceftriaxone in combination with an aminoglycoside for two weeks (short course) are effective modes of treatment for streptococcal endocarditis, the most common cause of IE. This treatment is also effective for carefully selected patients with other types of endocarditis, such as those due to the HACEK group (Haemophilus aphrophilus/paraphrophilis, Actinobacillus actinomycetem comitans, Caradiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella kingae). Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and late prosthetic valve endocarditis associated with a streptococcus may also be treated on an outpatient basis after stabilization (approximately 2 weeks). As a result of their need for prolonged treatment periods, these patients are also very good candidates for OPAT. In conclusion, new regimens utilizing ceftriaxone once daily and short-term therapy on a clinical or home basis offer the potential benefits of cheaper safer and more convenient treatment for patients with IE.
TI  - Coaggregation between Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - To elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including Treponema denticola in vitro. Coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. P. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of T. denticola and Treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with T. socranskii subspecies buccale, T. socranskii subspecies paredis, Treponema vincentii, or Treponema pectinovorum. The extracted hemagglutinin from P. gingivalis was active agglutinating T. denticola cells. Addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. Heat treatment of T. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of P. gingivalis cells eliminated it. Growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. Strains of T. denticola ATCC 35404 and 35405 and T. vincentii inhibited the growth of some P. gingivalis strains, but not others. No strain of Treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. The coaggregation observed between P. gingivalis and T. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils and essential oil components towards oral bacteria.
AB  - A method for reproducibly determining minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of plant extracts towards fastidiously and facultatively anaerobic oral bacteria, predicated upon measurements of optical densities in microtitre plate wells, was devised. The antimicrobial properties of some botanical oils were surveyed; of these, Australian tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and sage oil proved to be the most potent essential oils, whereas thymol and eugenol were potent essential oil components.
TI  - Needle licker's osteomyelitis.
AB  - Eikenella corrodens, a fastidious, slow-growing, gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacillus may be encountered in wounds exposed to human saliva, especially human bites and head and neck infections. An unusual case of a mixed flora E corrodens and Streptococcus septic arthritis with adjacent osteomyelitis secondary to saliva contamination from licking an intravenous (i.v.) needle is presented. A literature search showed 53 previous cases of E corrodens infections in i.v. drug users. However, none of these infections affected bones or joints. The microbiology and unusual antibiotic sensitivity are presented. Recommendations for treatment include penicillin or ampicillin. Tetracycline is recommended in the penicillin-allergic patient. This is the first case that draws attention to the connection between E corrodens, i.v. drug use, and septic arthritis and osteomyelitis.
TI  - [Bite wound infections: study of 22 hospitalized patients].
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the characteristics of bite wounds with unfavorable evolution, developing infectious complications that requires hospital admission. METHODS: The data from 22 patients admitted to the Ciudad Sanitaria Vall d'Hebron hospital for the above mentioned reason over the last 5 years were reviewed. RESULTS: The patients (8 males, 8 females and 6 children) were bitten by 10 dogs, 6 cats, and 6 men with predominance of the wound site being in the upper limb (10) followed by the lower limbs (6), head or face (5) and exceptionally on the breast (1). The most frequent clinical manifestation was abscess and/or cellulitis (13) and adenopathies or lymphangitis (4); 5 patients presented osteoarticular involvement including 3 bone fractures due to human aggression. With regard to the etiology of infection, the common bucal flora bacteria were isolated in all the cases; Pasteurella multocida in 15/16 animal bites, Eikenella corrodens associated to streptococcus in 5/6 human bites, Fusobacterium spp. (5), Bacteroides spp. (3) and Peptococcus sp. (1). The most frequently administered antibiotics were gentamycin (15), penicillin (13), cloxacillin (5) and clindamycin (4). The evolution was favorable, although slow in many cases, with sequelae in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: It is very difficult to foresee in which cases infectious complications will develop in bite wounds. According to the authors' experience, in the case of deep wounds the bacteria implied come from the mouth of the aggressor. Careful cleansing, rapid administration of an adequate antibiotic and clinical control being the most recommendable procedure.
TI  - Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against bacterial lectin of Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - A lectin-like substance (EcLS) was purified from the Eikenella corrodens 1073 cell and monoclonal antibodies were produced against it to confirm the role of EcLS in adhesive properties of E. corrodens such as hemagglutination and coaggregation with oral bacteria. Four hybridoma clones were selected. Two of the antibodies were of the IgG1 isotype and the others were of the IgG2b isotype. These monoclonal antibodies inhibited both the hemagglutination of E. corrodens and the coaggregation with Actinomyces viscosus or Streptococcus sanguis. The reactivity of the monoclonal antibody to E. corrodens 1073 was significantly higher than that to E. corrodens 1080 of which adhesive activity was weaker than that of E. corrodens 1073. These findings suggest the difference in adhesive properties is due to the difference in the amount of EcLS expressed on the cell surface. The immunoelectron microscopic study revealed that EcLS of E. corrodens 1073 was localized in the outer space of outer membrane, not in cell surface appendages such as fimbriae where bacteria possessed adhesin. These results suggest that coaggregation of E. corrodens with A. viscosus or S. sanguis was mediated by EcLS.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
TI  - Abscesses of the upper extremity from drug abuse by injection.
AB  - A 4-year retrospective review of 59 consecutive upper extremity abscesses associated with drug abuse by injection is reported. There were 57 patients, with the most common location being the forearm. All abscesses were treated with incision, drainage, and intravenous antibiotics. Seventeen patients required more than one debridement; nine were complicated by fasciitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or septic tenosynovitis. Thirty-one patients had human immunodeficiency virus testing, and nine results were positive. Bacteriology showed the most common organisms to be streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Eikenella corrodens. Nineteen percent of the abscesses had anaerobes cultured. Most of the organisms cultured were common oral or skin flora.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - Microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in Malaysia.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. Seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period January 1985 to December 1988. More than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. Chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. Approximately 25% of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections. Pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. Streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being Streptococcus milleri. Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putrifaciens and Bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. Streptococcus milleri, Bacteroides sp and Eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. In patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. Anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. Culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the detection of the anaerobes. Based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - Bacteria reactive to plaque-toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are related  to the severity of gingivitis at the sampled site.
AB  - Certain monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) neutralize the inhibition of HL60 cell growth by bacterial plaque extracts. The aim of this study was to enumerate and identify the bacteria reactive to these Mabs at sites where periodontal disease was measured by gingival index, pocket depth and attachment loss. The bacterial colonies were grown on blood agar and the colonies counted directly and after immunoblotting. Sites that bled on probing (n = 15) had a mean of 3.35% Mab-positive colonies (SEM = 0.52%) and sites that did not bleed (n = 9) had a mean of 1.61% (SEM = 0.41%). The percentage of Mab-positive colonies also correlated with gingival index but not with the total number of colonies sampled, attachment loss or pocket depth. Antigen was expressed by 4 genera: strains of Streptococcus sanguis and/or Eikenella corrodens (8 sites), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4 sites) and Corynebacterium minutissimus (1 site). The results suggest that the antigens detected on these bacteria by the Mabs may be processed to form toxins and maintain gingivitis by irritating the surrounding cells.
TI  - An analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. A further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. A total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 Ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. The samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. The periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. The results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for Campylobacter rectus, 80% for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for Streptococcus sanguis, 72% for Streptococcus mitis, 66% for Eikenella corrodens, 58% for Prevotella intermedia, 32% for Capnocytophaga, 27% for Selenomonas, 25% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for Porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for Streptococcus mutans. Small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring P. gingivalis, A. actinomytecomitans or > 5% P. intermedia and the rest of the sample. Similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of green tea extract, flavono flavor and copper chlorophyll  against oral bacteria.
TI  - Association between Eikenella corrodens and streptococci.
TI  - Sub-gingival microflora in Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  - The Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. This report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in M. mulatta monkeys. Three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. Plaque samples were obtained from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. Several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. The major microbial groups were Haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (TAC): 21-51), Peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), Actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (BPAR) (80%, 0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). Microbial groups detected less often were Wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), Capnocytophaga sp. (30%), Eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), Campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). Seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. The gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the Actinomyces sp., P. micros and BPAR; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to pre-scaling levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (Bacteroides, gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Eikenella corrodens) and two control species (Streptococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) aqueous solution in vitro. The PVP-I solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. The strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. Based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous PVP-I for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.
TI  - Orbital cellulitis caused by Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - Eikenella corrodens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacillus with specific culture and growth requirements and unusual antibacterial susceptibilities. It has only recently been recognized as a human pathogen. Ocular and adnexal infections with this organism are rare especially in children. We treated two children with orbital cellulitis caused by E. corrodens. One was an 8-year-old boy; the other was an 11-year-old girl. Orbital cellulitis in both patients occurred after an upper respiratory tract infection. Sinusitis and a subperiosteal abscess were present in both patients. Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus viridans were isolated from the boy; E. corrodens was the sole isolate in the girl. Intravenous ampicillin, prolonged hospitalization, and surgical drainage of the orbit were required to control the infection in both patients. Eikenella corrodens must be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital cellulitis in children, and ophthalmologists must become familiar with the characteristics of this peculiar organism.
TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. Periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. Only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. The antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to Actinobacillus sp., P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia in that order. In general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. However, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. In addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. These findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. Differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. These included high levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 in LJP and RPP subjects and to A. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in LJP and GJP subjects.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of azithromycin, macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin and spiramycin) and streptogramin RP 59500 against oral organisms.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of azithromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin and RP 59500  were compared with erythromycin against a wide range of oral organisms which have been implicated in oral infections and/or endocarditis (clindamycin was included for oral streptococci). All compounds tested showed good activity against many of these organisms, although some variation was observed with different species. Clarithromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against Gram-positive anaerobes, including Actinomyces spp., Propionibacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium dentium. Azithromycin was slightly less active than erythromycin against these species. In general, RP 59500 had higher MICs than the macrolides, other than spiramycin, against these organisms, but was superior in activity against Peptostreptococcus spp., inhibiting all isolates at 2 mg/L. Azithromycin was, in general, the most active antibiotic tested against the Gram-negative anaerobes: Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Wolinella spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Selenomonas spp. and Mitsuokella multiacida, including those isolates which were insusceptible to erythromycin. Clarithromycin showed similar activity to erythromycin against most Gram-negative species, but was superior against Capnocytophaga ochraceus and Eikenella corrodens. RP 59500 was less active than the macrolides against most Gram-negative anaerobes, but was superior to erythromycin and clarithromycin against Fusobacterium spp. and Leptotrichia buccalis, some strains of which were moderately resistant to erythromycin. The macrolides and clindamycin were about equally active against the oral streptococci, whereas RP 59500 showed lower inhibitory activity. The in-vitro results suggest that azithromycin and clarithromycin may be of value in the treatment of dental sepsis and the prophylaxis of endocarditis. RP 59500 showed useful activity against Gram-positive anaerobes and, because of its bactericidal activity against oral streptococci, may also prove to have a role in these areas.
TI  - Humoral IgG antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. Their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. The etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral IgG antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years, who were at risk for root-surface caries. Antibody activity to Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt, S. mutans/S. sobrinus GTFs, S. faecalis strain 19433, Actinomyces viscosus strain WVU 626, Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, Lactobacillus casei, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, Eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and Wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by ELISA. Pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. IgG antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject DMF scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between DMF scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. Further relationships between levels of S. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. Numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. Although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. Adherence of PMNs to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. In this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on PMN activation using an in vitro method of measuring PMN adherence to Dacron fibres. Most of the bacteria investigated increased PMN adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of PMN lysosomal enzymes and other products. In contrast, Bacteroides species suppressed PMNs, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. The modulatory effects of oral bacteria on PMN activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - Eikenella corrodens and group C streptococci.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Minocycline slow-release formulation effect on subgingival bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the microbiological efficacy of an adjunctive minocycline periodontal formulation delivered subgingivally. Subjects were systemically healthy but exhibited severe periodontitis; i.e., probing depths greater than 6 mm. The two study groups included individuals who received minocycline or a placebo periodontal formulation after root planing. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained at baseline; prior to treatment; and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Plaque was evaluated by darkfield microscopy and further analyzed for total dark-pigmented Bacteroides species, P. intermedia, P. gingivalis and Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Eikenella, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, and Fusobacterium species using cultivable flora techniques. In addition, plaque was evaluated for yeast on a selective agar medium. When compared to the placebo, the minocycline group had significantly lower proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months and lower proportions of motile rods at 3 months. Furthermore, when compared to the placebo group, the minocycline patients had lower mean proportions of dark-pigmented Bacteroides spp. and P. intermedia at 1 and 3 months as well as lower proportions of E. corrodens at 1 month. The minocycline group had significant decreases in proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months, motile rods at 1 and 3 months, and increases in cocci at 1, 3, and 6 months when compared to baseline. In the placebo group, root planing was also effective at decreasing spirochetes at 1, 3, and 6 months, but with significant differences seen only at 3 and 6 months. However, the degree of reduction in spirochete proportions was greater in the minocycline group when compared with the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological characteristics of subjects with "refractory" periodontal disease.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between attachment loss and clinical, microbiological, and immunological parameters in a group of 21 human subjects exhibiting poor response to previous periodontal therapy. All had been treated with periodontal surgery, tetracycline, and subsequent maintenance recalls to periodontists who, upon detection of disease progression, referred the subjects to our clinic. In our clinic, each subject received oral hygiene instruction and a thorough subgingival scaling and root planing utilizing as many appointments as necessary. Clinical indices, including gingival index, bleeding on probing, suppuration, plaque index, pocket depth, and duplicate measurements of attachment level from an acrylic stent, were collected at monthly intervals. Probing measurements were performed using the Florida Probe. When significant attachment loss (0.8-1.2 mm) was detected in at least 1 site, a bacterial sample was taken from that site and from a comparably deep, but non-progressing, control site. Microbial samples were enumerated by darkfield microscopy, on selective and non-selective media, and by predominant cultivable technique. Blood samples were also collected to determine antibody levels against potential pathogens. There was no difference in the amount of plaque present in sites gaining or losing attachment, but losing sites exhibited more bleeding and suppuration. 20 of the 21 subjects were tested; of these, 17 exhibited elevated serum antibody against one or more of the following microorganisms: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides, gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens. However, few, if any, of the "classical" pathogens were detected in the plaque samples obtained at the time progressive disease was diagnosed. The only exception was Streptococcus intermedius, which occurred in slightly higher numbers in active sites.
TI  - Parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
AB  - The medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Eikenella corrodens. No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients. Twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication. A thickened pleural "peel," scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural pH and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management. A scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease. In patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs. 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs. 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (P less than 0.001).
TI  - Microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  - Animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. The rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. Furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues with ligatures. Experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium nucleatum). The studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like Streptococcus sobrinus and Actinomyces viscosus are associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. Studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. Studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. However, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. In the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.
TI  - [A case with acute suppurative thyroiditis due to Eikenella corrodens and alpha-Streptococcus].
AB  - A 6-year-old girl with acute suppurative thyroiditis is reported. She suffered from suppurative thyroiditis twice, and E. corrodens and alpha-streptococcus were grown from the abscess each time. They were sensitive to antibiotics used, but surgical drainage was necessary to cease to inflammation each time. E. corrodens seemed to be a causative organism with or without another organism in compromised patients and/or patients with anatomical abnormalities. The presented patient was supposed to have some anatomical abnormality such as an internal fistula from the piriform sinus connecting the perithyroidal space, however, no abnormalities were detected during these episodes.
TI  - [Eikenella corrodens as part of the polymicrobial flora in infectious endocarditis].
AB  - The authors describe a case of polymicrobial endocarditis in a 24-year-old patient with immunodeficiency and a damaged heart (mitral valve affection, septal defect). Among the mixed flora, comprising Streptococcus intermedius and two types of the genus Bacteroides, in the haemoculture also a microaerophil potentially pathogenic type Eikenella corrodens was cultivated. The authors describe the properties of Eikenella corrodens, its occurrence in man and its ability to produce an infectious process in primarily damaged organs (in particular the endocardium) in weakened subjects and drug addicts. The authors mention the diagnostic criteria for assessment of Eikenella corrodens and how to cultivate it from infectious material.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethanol/chlorhexidine combinations.
AB  - A total of 57 bacterial strains (26 different species) which may be isolated from subgingival plaque were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to phenoxycthanol, a commonly-used antiseptic and preservative. Ninety-five percent of the strains, including those associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease, were susceptible to concentrations of phenoxyethanol used topically (2% w/v). Phenoxyethanol at a concentration of 1% (w/v) was also found that to have a rapid bactericidal effect achieving a 99.9% kill in 5 minutes or less for species such as Bacterodides gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, and Wolinella recta. Addition of chlorhexidine to phenoxyethanol resulted in a mixture with increased antibacterial activity. For most bacterial strains, the presence of chlorhexidine resulted in at least a four-fold decrease in the concentration of pheoxyethanol required for inhibition of growth. These results imply that phenoxyethanol may be useful in the treatment of chronic inflammatory periodontal disease either by itself or in combination with chlorhexidine.
TI  - Evaluation of the activity of four antimicrobial agents using an in vitro rapid micromethod against oral streptococci and various bacterial strains implicated in periodontitis.
AB  - The activity of various antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, josamycin, doxycycline and metronidazole) was established in vitro using a rapid micromethod. The activity of these agents, which are widely used in oral medicine, was evaluated against microorganisms responsible for periodontitis and bucco-dental infections. Their action against alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including pneumococci) which make up the majority of the indigenous oral flora was also tested. Amoxicillin was found to be effective against all the strains tested. Doxycycline was active against periodontal bacteria, but not against 50% of the streptococcal flora. Josamycin was found to be effective against streptococci, but appeared without effect on Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Metronidazole, inactive against streptococci, displayed greater activity towards the strict anaerobes. The use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bucco-dental infections, especially periodontitis, is discussed. For periodontitis and periodontal suppurations, antimicrobial agents present a valuable adjunct to local treatments such as scaling or rootplaning. This may prevent more serious infections such as endocarditis that can develop after tooth extraction.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  - Chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. The controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. The effect on the following bacteria was studied: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Wolinella recta, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. Chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. The plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. Distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. Thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
TI  - Species-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes for the identification of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were developed for identification of the periodontal  bacteria Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, B. intermedius types I and II, B. forsythus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Wolinella recta. Probes were designed by sequencing the 16S rRNA for each bacterium, identifying hypervariable regions, and chemically synthesizing species-specific probes. These probes were specific when tested against a panel of nucleic acids from closely related bacteria.
TI  - Eikenella corrodens infection of the oral cavity as a cause of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - The authors describe the case of a 24-year-old woman with valve disease. After a  bout of respiratory tract infection, she was diagnosed to have bacterial endocarditis associated with mitral valve disease. The causative agents isolated included Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides bivius. At the same time, the patient was found to have developed IgA immunodeficiency. A complication accompanying the cardiac disease was spontaneous pneumothorax. Since antibiotic therapy had failed, the mitral valve was replaced by a prosthetic one. After the procedure, the patient had her teeth examined. The examination revealed complete destruction of tooth 36, thick layers of calculus and chronic gingivitis. E. corrodens was isolated also after microbiological examination of the patient's oral cavity. The reason for reporting on what we regard as an interesting case is that bacterial endocarditis with E. corrodens implicated as the causative agent is relatively rare; to date, polymicrobial endocarditis due to E. corrodens and other microorganisms has been described in intravenous drug addicts only.
TI  - Eikenella corrodens cellulitis and arthritis of the knee.
AB  - Severe cellulitis and septic arthritis due to Eikenella corrodens and a viridans  group streptococcus developed following dental manipulation in a patient with a history of hemarthrosis. Correct diagnosis was achieved by recognition of E. corrodens on a culture of a knee aspirate. Antimicrobial (ampicillin) therapy resulted in a therapeutic response.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of crevicular epithelial cells.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the composition of the predominant cultivable microbiota associated with gingival crevicular epithelial cells with that of the unattached microbiota recovered from the same site. Samples were taken from 2 diseased sites from 8 periodontal patients, by scraping the epithelial lining of the pocket with a curette. The epithelial cells were separated from the unattached subgingival bacteria by centrifugation in a reduced 50% Percoll density gradient. Epithelial cells formed a band at the top of the gradient and were removed separately from the unattached bacteria located at the base. Each layer was dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood and 50 isolates were characterized from each sample. The microorganisms associated with the epithelial layer harbored 5- to 20-fold higher mean percentages of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius and Peptostreptococcus micros. The layer of unattached organisms exhibited 4- to 10-fold higher mean percentages of Streptococcus uberis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens and Veillonella parvula.
TI  - The comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (SE) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) was compared. Equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of SE were used to challenge HGF cultures. The cytotoxic potential of each SE was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit HGF proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation in HGF cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. The highest concentration (500 micrograms SE protein/ml) of any of the SEs used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the HGFs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. At the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms SE protein/ml); only SE from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the HGFs as determined by any of the criteria employed. SE from Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, or Wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. The SE of the three other organisms tested (Actinomyces odontolyticus, Bacteroides intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. The data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
TI  - Coaggregation of Eikenella corrodens with oral bacteria mediated by bacterial lectin-like substance.
TI  - Frequency distributions of periodontal attachment loss. Clinical and microbiological features.
AB  - The present investigation attempted to determine if the pattern of past periodontal destruction could be concisely summarized, and related to other clinical and microbiological parameters. 61 subjects between the ages of 12 and 61 years with destructive periodontal disease were evaluated at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. The frequency distribution of baseline attachment level measurements was computed for each individual. A curve fitting algorithm was used to fit the frequency distribution to 1-, 2-, and 3-term normal distributions. The parameters of the fit could be used to summarize concisely all of the frequency distributions. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished. Pattern I required a two-term distribution with localized destruction at less than 34% of sites and was further divided into 3 groups, depending on average attachment loss at diseased sites. The means of the second peak for the subgroups were 2.7, 5.3, and 8.6 mm, respectively. Pattern II exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with multiple peaks in the frequency distribution requiring a 3-term distribution for satisfactory fit. However, a significant proportion of sites was not affected. Pattern III exhibited a single-peaked normal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. Mean attachment levels of the peaks in this group ranged from 2.7 to 8.4 mm. 23 of the 61 subjects showed significant attachment loss at 1 or more sites during the course of bi-monthly monitoring, as determined by the tolerance method of analysis. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these active sites and matched with control sites prior to therapy. The proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius, and Eikenella corrodens were significantly elevated in active and control sites of subjects in groups II and III combined (the widespread disease groups), and proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Propionibacterium acnes were elevated in active and control sites of the more localized disease group I subjects. Group I subjects showed a 13- to 15-fold decrease in hazard rates of periodontal sites after Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline, whereas groups II and III subjects showed 2-to 6-fold decreases.
TI  - Attachment level changes in destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - The present communication attempts to summarize some of the features of attachment loss which are of interest to the clinician and the statistician analyzing data from clinical trials. These include the measurements employed to detect changes in attachment level, the nature of the destructive disease process and the effects of therapy on the attachment level measurements. Although there are several difficulties associated with the attachment level measurement, at the present time it appears to be the best estimator of periodontal attachment available. The overall standard deviation of this measurement in greater than 46,000 replicate measurements at periodontal sites in 58 subjects was 0.78 mm (range 0.4 to 1.2 mm). In the periodontally healthy subject, the length of the attachment measured around 28 teeth is approximately 700 mm. Therefore, there are approximately 1400 adjacent points along the periodontal attachment where a measurement could be made using a periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip. If 6 measurements were recorded per tooth, then approximately 12% of the possible probable points would be evaluated. Recent data indicate that destructive periodontal diseases progress with acute bursts of activity rather than as slowly progressive, continual processes. Such findings suggest new models of attachment loss progression. In one likely model, destructive periodontal diseases would progress by asynchronous bursts of activity at individual sites which occur with greater frequency during a finite period of time in an individual's life. 3 major patterns of attachment loss could be distinguished when frequency distributions of attachment level measurements were constructed for 61 destructive periodontal disease subjects. Pattern I (30 subjects) exhibited a bimodal distribution with localized destruction occurring at less than 34% of sites. Pattern II (14 subjects) exhibited more widespread disease (greater than 33% of sites affected) with a trimodal frequency distribution. Pattern III (17 subjects) exhibited a unimodal distribution in which virtually all sites were affected. The proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus intermedius and Eikenella corrodens in subgingival plaque samples were significantly elevated in sites of subjects with patterns II and III (the widespread disease groups). Bacteroides intermedius, Streptococcus uberis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in sampled sites of localized disease subjects (pattern I). The effects of therapy by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline were examined by several statistical analyses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities of periodontal bacteria. In vitro susceptibilities to eight antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 369 to 966 bacterial isolates from periodontal lesions to eight antibiotics were determined by agar dilution technique as a means of determining which antimicrobial agents were inhibitory for bacteria frequently associated with destructive periodontal diseases. Although most bacteria were relatively susceptible to the penicillins, greater activity was generally noted with amoxicillin than with either penicillin or ampicillin with the exception of Selenomonas sputigena and Peptostreptococcus. Antibacterial activities obtained with minocycline were significantly higher than with tetracycline for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus but comparable for most other taxa. Clindamycin and metronidazole both demonstrated excellent activity against the anaerobic Gram-negative rods but were less effective against some of the capnophilic and facultative organisms. Eikenella corrodens was exceptionally resistant to both of these drugs; and A. actinomycetemcomitans was generally resistant to clindamycin but relatively susceptible to metronidazole. Erythromycin was considerably less active than the other antibiotics against the majority of the periodontal bacteria. No single antibiotic, at concentrations equivalent to those achieved in body fluids, was uniformly effective in inhibiting all bacteria currently implicated or suspected as etiologic agents of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Survival analysis of periodontal sites before and after periodontal therapy.
AB  - Periodontal diseases appear to progress with bursts of destructive activity at individual sites. One effect of treatment might be to diminish the frequency of such bursts. Survival analysis was employed to seek such effects on the periodontal sites of 16 individuals with prior evidence of destructive periodontal disease. The subjects were monitored at bi-monthly intervals and actively breaking down sites were detected using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis. When active sites were detected, control sites of equal pocket depth and attachment loss were selected and microbiological and immunological samples were taken. The subjects were treated by modified Widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. On completion of therapy, bi-monthly monitoring was reinstituted. Life tables were constructed for periodontal sites in each of the 16 subjects prior to and after therapy. A site losing more than 3 mm of attachment at any time interval was considered to have relapsed or "died". Survivor functions were calculated for each time period indicating the % of sites which survived at any time. The subjects were divided into 3 categories on the basis of post-therapy survivor functions. The annual hazard rate in 9 good treatment response subjects (group 1) was reduced from 0.10/year to 0.01/year. The hazard rate of 5 intermediate treatment response subjects (group 2A) was reduced from 0.16/year to 0.04/year and that of 2 poor treatment response subjects (group 2B) from 0.15/year to 0.07/year. Group 2A and 2B individuals were combined and differences were sought in clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters between the good and poor treatment response groups. 5 out of 7 of the poor responding individuals showed elevated humoral antibody responses to 3 or more gram-negative subgingival species tested. Many of the elevated responses in this group were to organisms which are widely distributed and return quickly after therapy such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides intermedius and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The predominant cultivable microbiota in subgingival samples taken prior to therapy from the good responding group had significantly greater proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea and B. intermedius than the poor responding group. The latter group showed significantly elevated proportions of F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros and Streptococcus intermedius.
TI  - Efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  - Imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. The mean duration of treatment was 29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. Causative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, S. aureus plus group B Streptococcus in one, viridans group Streptococcus in two, Neisseria subflava, Eikenella corrodens, and group G Streptococcus in one patient, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Hemophilus aphrophilus, and Enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. The minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04 micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against H. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against E. aerogenes. The site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. The mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. All patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. Adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on Day 26 of therapy. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.
TI  - Bacteriology in juvenile periodontitis. A review.
TI  - The relationships between streptococcal species and periodontopathic bacteria in  human dental plaque.
AB  - The existence of antagonistic and commensal relationships between microorganisms  was investigated. The predominant cultivable flora in 172 plaque samples from active and non-active sites in 32 human subjects with destructive periodontitis was determined. The presence of putative periodontopathic organisms (Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Wolinella recta, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Eikenella corrodens) in a site was correlated with the absence of certain viridans streptococci (Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus intermedius), and vice versa. A strong commensal relationship was found between B. gingivalis and Strep. intermedius. The second study involved 3 subjects with intractable periodontitis whose plaque harboured large numbers of one or more of these periodontopathic organisms. This plaque contained fewer organisms capable of inhibiting the growth of the periodontopathic strains in vitro when compared with a clinically-healthy control subject. Intermediate levels of inhibitors were found in plaque taken from non-active lesions. The majority of inhibitors in plaque from the healthy control were viridans streptococci. Hydrogen-peroxide production by these organisms appears to be the principal mechanism of growth inhibition for periodontopathic organisms. Bacterial interactions may thus be causally related to both periodontal health and disease.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. The subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. Using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. Active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. The control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. Bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. Similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. The proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of Bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. sputigena and Eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of B. intermedius and E. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species had increased. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. The proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis II and Campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. Humoral antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena significantly increased in a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. Antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. Crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  - The detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating Streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. It is also useful in identifying Eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Bacillus. Currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. Starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. A 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. The reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees C. When dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees C for 4 weeks.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of Yersinia enterocolitica, Eikenella corrodens, and penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam and alternative antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 14 strains of Yersinia enterocolitica, 28 strains of Eikenella corrodens, 10 strains of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 10 strains of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae. Y. enterocolitica was found to be susceptible to the aminoglycosides tested and to chloramphenicol, moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime but resistant to ampicillin and variably susceptible to carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. On a weight basis, cefotaxime and moxalactam were the most active agents against E. corrodens. Most strains of E. corrodens were resistant to the aminoglycosides tested: gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. Penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was most susceptible to cefotaxime and moxalactam. Cefotaxime was consistently active against all tested strains of Y. enterocolitica, E. corrodens, and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, three unusual but clinically significant pathogens.
TI  - Polymicrobial endocarditis in a drug addict; therapeutic and epidemiologic implications.
TI  - Ultrasonic dispersion of pure cultures of plaque bacteria and plaque.
AB  - This study compared the sonic sensitivity of 12 Gram-negative and two Gram-positive bacteria commonly encountered in plaque associated with periodontal diseases. Pure bacterial cultures were grown to standard turbidity, diluted in 1/4 strength prereduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, and aliquots dispersed for 0-180 s, using an MSE sonic oscillator at 6 micron under 80% N2, 10% H2 and 10% CO2. Viable recoveries were determined on anaerobically cultured trypticase soy 5% blood agar plates. Breakage of T. denticola was assessed by electron microscopy. Gram-positive organisms tolerated sonication better than Gram-negative. A. viscous was more resistant than Strep sanguis. Gram-negative bacteria could be divided into groups according to their sensitivity. Eikenella corrodens was most resistant, followed by F. nucleatum B asaccharolyticus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, A actinomycetemcomitans, a strain (2097) of Group IV Bacteroides, and B melaninogenicus ss intermedius resisted sonication better than "corroding' Bacteroides and oral Campylobacter. T. denticola, Selenomonas sputigena and Wolinella were most sensitive with viable counts which declined after sonication for 5-10 s. Recoveries from plaque taken from five patients with periodontal diseases increased with sonication time, reaching higher values for suprangingival than for subgingival samples.
TI  - Polymicrobial endocarditis involving Eikenella corrodens.
AB  - Two amphetamine abusers had polymicrobial endocarditis involving Eikenella corrodens as one of the infecting organisms. A 26-year-old woman with left-sided endocarditis due to S. aureus and Eikenella corrodens was treated successfully; however, severe mitral regurgitation resulted from the infection. In the second patient, a 29-year-old man with right-sided endocarditis, three organisms were isolated: a hemolytic Streptococcus, a non-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Eikenella corrodens. This is the first report of polymicrobial endocarditis involving Eikenella corrodens, and emphasizes the importance of this organism parenteral amphetamine abusers. Pitfalls in the diagnosis of polymicrobial endocarditis are discussed, with particular reference to the difficulties in the recognition and management of Eikenella valve infections.
TI  - Lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  - We assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. When the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. The Actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas Streptococcus sanguis, Campylobacter, and Eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. The response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. However, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. These results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease states.
TI  - Polymicrobial endocarditis due to Eikenella corrodens and group B beta-hemolytic  streptococcus.
TI  - An unusual organism causing orbital cellulitis.
AB  - Bacterial orbital cellulitis is a feared complication of paranasal sinus infection. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species are the commoner pathogens involved in these cases. However, anaerobic bacteria and unusual Gram-negative organisms should be suspected as well. We treated a case of bacterial orbital cellulitis due to foci of infected paranasal sinuses caused by Eikenella corrodens, a Gram-negative rod. The patient was managed with intensive antibiotic coverage and surgical intervention.
TI  - Deep fasciitis of the biceps region.
AB  - An infection of the biceps fascia, later myositis, and spreading to the pectoralis is described in six patients. The majority were synergistic infections with an anaerobic Peptococcus, Eikenella, or Bacteroides and an aerobic Streptococcus. Five of the patients were drug abusers. Excision of the biceps and portions of the pectoralis major was necessary in four patients.
TI  - Eikenella corrodens in human bites.
AB  - Eikenella corrodens, a gram negative rod, was cultured in about one third of 24 patients with human bite wounds. The organism was sensitive to penicillin but not to methicillin. Clinically the infections in which Eikenella corrodens were found were not different from other infections. Because of the variety of possible pathogens in human bite infections, we start the patients on a broad spectrum antibiotic while awaiting the results of the culture and sensitivity. However, antibiotics alone are not sufficient treatment in HBI; 20 of 24 patients in this series required surgical drainage. Surgical treatment consists of thorough exploration, exteriorization and excision of devitalized tissues. Complications were more frequent in sutured wounds, or when surgical drainage was delayed.
TI  - Liver abscess: eikenella corrodens and streptococci.
TI  - A Trichomonas species in a mixed microbial meningitis.
TI  - Initial colonization of teeth in monkeys as related to diet.
AB  - The initial phases of plaque development on nonretentive tooth surfaces were studied bacteriologically in Macaca irus monkeys fed by stomach tube and provided with various oral supplements. Except for the oral implantation of Streptococcus mutans in some of the animals, the oral flora was not changed prior to the studies. Dental plaque was allowed to develop on initially cleaned tooth surfaces for 3 to 5 h. Plaque samples were collected and cultured on a number of selective and nonselective agar media, and several hundred isolates from each sample were isolated and identified. The numerically predominant organisms in initial plaque were S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Actinomyces viscosus. Additional organisms regularly found, but usually in smaller numbers, were Streptococcus mitior and a group of fastidious gram-negative rods including Haemophilus species, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans. The colonization of S. mutans was dependent on sucrose and occurred at the expense of S. sanguis. In these experiments S. mutans accounted for 25 to 65% of the primary plaque formers. All other species encountered colonized the teeth irrespective of the diet. It is postulated that the early sucrose-dependent establishment of S. mutans directly on the enamel pellicle plays a key role in the development of a cariogenic plaque.
TI  - Some observations on the effects produced in white mice following the injection of certain suspensions of corroding bacilli.
AB  - Strictly anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic strains of "corroding bacilli" failed to produce any pathological symptoms when injected into white mice and no viable organisms could be recovered after 7 days. However, when these same strains were coupled with certain other living bacteria or certain sterile bacterial extracts, lesions developed from which corroding bacilli could be isolated even after 21 days.
