TI  - Destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  Raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. Raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. However, before Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic identification. Prior to the isolation, a liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture Pronase E is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. The extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with 6.107 to 6.104 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus. The compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a Raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A classification of single-cell Raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. Graphical Abstract Development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by Raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.
TI  - [Epidemiology of neonatal purulent meningitis in Hebei Province, China: a multicenter study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and main pathogenic bacteria, and outcomes of neonatal purulent meningitis. METHODS: A prospective epidemiological study was conducted in neonates with purulent meningitis admitted to 23 cooperating hospitals between 2013 and 2014. Clinical data were collected and clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 301 neonates with purulent meningitis from the 23 cooperating hospitals were included. Neonatal pneumonia was the most common primary disease (167 cases, 55.5%). Fever was the most common manifestation (214 cases, 71.1%). Blood culture findings were positive in 72 patients (23.9%), with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. Positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was found in 36 patients (36/264, 13.6%) , with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common bacteria. The median of CSF WBC counts was 80/mm(3) (range: 0-9 2500/mm(3)), and 11 cases (3.7%) had CSF WBC counts of <20/mm(3) and 154 cases (51.2%) had CSF WBC counts of >100/mm(3). There were 258 patients (85.7%) who were cured or improved at discharge and 15 deaths (15/298, 5.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common primary disease of neonatal purulent meningitis is neonatal pneumonia in this area. The patients with neonatal purulent meningitis most often present with fever. Escherichia coli is the leading pathogenic bacteria causing neonatal purulent meningitis. A normal CSF WBC count can barely be used to exclude the possibility of this diosorder.
TI  - Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne Essential Oil.
AB  - Eyebright, Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne (Scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. Some Euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. However, the composition and bioactivity of E. rostkoviana oil are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). The essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The best activity was observed against all Gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition of E. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Metabolic pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic airway infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (CF) patients. Complex interplays between P. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia sp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. METHODS: We generated a library of PA14 transposon insertion mutants to identify P. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with S. aureus, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and K. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Whereas wild-type PA14 inhibited S. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsC and carB, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. PqsC is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carB is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. The carB mutant was also unable to grow in the presence of B. cepacia and K. pneumoniae but not Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. We further identified a transposon insertion in purF, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. This mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of Gram-negative but not of Gram-positive bacteria. We identified a beneficial interaction in a bioA transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. This growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of K. pneumoniae or E. coli. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing CF-lungs. This work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between P. aeruginosa and three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. Manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma technology.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (MB) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, MB/light treatment and MB filtration. Virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. RESULTS: Leucocyte filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than 4 logs (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of detection (LOD) (>/= 4.8 logs; Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae). MB/light and MB filtration further reduced Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to below the LOD. The small bacterium Brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the LOD by additional MB/light treatment and MB filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). Suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by THERAFLEX MB-Plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. CONCLUSION: THERAFLEX MB-Plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. Its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.
TI  - Validation of sterility testing of cord blood: Challenges and results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sterility testing for cord blood (CB) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. Here, the automated BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in CB units processed at the Canadian National Public Cord Blood Bank. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-phase validation was developed. CB units were prepared with pentastarch (Phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (Phase 3). In Phase 1, CB was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Candida albicans. Plasma (8 mL) and buffy coat (BC; 0.5 and 8 mL) were inoculated into culture bottles. In Phases 2 and 3, a mix of red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma (4 mL each) was used as the inoculant. In Phase 3, Aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product RBCs and plasma were determined. The BC fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. RESULTS: In Phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in CB units containing antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. C. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of RBCs and plasma, all organisms were detected. The use of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. C. albicans and A. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in RBCs and BC. Cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during CB processing. CONCLUSIONS: A mix of plasma and RBCs is appropriate for CB sterility testing. Interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. The clinical significance of the bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in CB merits further investigation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial analysis of aqueous humor after topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous humor in patients who had preoperative topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Twenty-nine eyes from 29 cataract surgery patients were included in this study. In the study group (n = 15 eyes), 3 topical applications of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% were administered preoperatively; in the control group (n = 14 eyes), no topical applications were administered. Aqueous humor samples were collected and stored in sterile microtubes at -80 degrees C until analysis. Antimicrobial analysis was performed using standard strains with standard sterile filter paper disks. Inhibition halos were measured in millimeters, and both bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects were analyzed. RESULTS: Inhibition halos were observed on most of the study group plates except those with Streptococcus pneumoniae: Escherichia coli (13.93 mm +/- 0.64 [SD]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.63 +/- 0.61 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (7.47 +/- 0.68 mm), and S epidermidis (4.20 +/- 3.33 mm) The differences between the mean inhibition halo diameters were statistically significant (P < .0001) in all samples. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: After topical application of moxifloxacin 0.5%, aqueous humor showed bacteriostatic effect against E coli, K pneumoniae, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms evaluated. No antimicrobial effect against S pneumoniae was observed. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oils from flower, leaf and stem of Ferula cupularis growing wild in Iran.
AB  - CONTEXT: Ferula cupularis (Boiss.) Spalik et S. R. Downie (Apiaceae) is a common  plant in Iran that grows in the foothills of Dena Mountain. In traditional folk medicine, this plant has different applications, but there are no studies proving their uses. OBJECTIVE: This study is the first attempt to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial effect of the essential oils of F. cupularis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oils from flower, leaf, and stem of F. cupularis were analyzed by using GC and GC-MS. Antibacterial activity of essential oils was determined by microdilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The essential oil from flower of F. cupularis contained 15 monoterpene, 13 oxygenated monoterpene, and 2 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The leaf essential oil contained 12 monoterpene, 13 oxygenated monoterpene, 2 sesquiterpene, 6 oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and 3 non-terpenoid components. Stem essential oil contained one monoterpene, 23 oxygenated monoterpene, 2 sesquiterpene, and 6 oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The MIC value of stem essential oil was 2.85 mg/mL against both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa which was inhibited at 22.75 mg/mL. The MIC values of leaf and flower essential oils were higher than 5.69 and 22.75 mg/mL, respectively. DISCUSSION: This study highlighted the strong antibacterial effect of Ferula cupularis's essential oil which might be due to its high content of oxygenated monoterpene hydrocarbons. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that this plant may be a good candidate for further biological and pharmacological investigations.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Essential oil of Eucalyptus gunnii hook. As a novel source of antioxidant, antimutagenic and antibacterial agents.
AB  - The present study describes radical scavenging capacity (RSC), antimutagenic and  antibacterial properties of the essential oil (EO) of the leaves of Eucalyptus gunnii Hook. (Southern Montenegro). Chemical composition was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In oil, 1,8-cineole (67.8%) and alpha-pinene (14.12%) were the major compounds comprising almost 82% of total EO. EO exhibited moderate DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity, with IC50 value of 7.19 microL/mL. The antimutagenic properties were assayed against the spontaneous and t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli IC202 oxyR mutant strain, deficient in removing radical oxygen species (ROS). Reduction of the spontaneous mutagenesis in the presence of E. gunnii EO was only slight, up to 12% at the highest concentration tested. However, when the oxidative mutagen was used, EO displayed more significant reduction of mutagenesis (maximum 23%) in a concentration dependent manner. Antibacterial activity was tested against the selected strains from ATTC and NCIB collections: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the two Escherichia coli strains from our laboratory collection (SY252 and IB112) using both the disk-diffusion and MIC assays. The greatest sensitivity was shown by M. flavus, K. pneumoniae and E. coli lpcA (MIC = 0.83 mg/mL), while the highest resistance was shown by E. coli (ATTC 25922) and S. epidermidis. This study represents the first report on chemical composition and biological activity of the Eucalyptus gunnii in the South Balkan region and beyond.
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in pediatric hematology/oncology patients after anticancer chemotherapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology and oncology represent a  major problem worldwide, but this has not been studied in Qatar. In this study, we investigated the burden of infection and the resistance pattern in the bacterial etiology, in the only tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology center in Qatar. METHODS: All pediatric cancer patients (n=185) were evaluated retrospectively during the period 2004-2011; a total of 70 (38%) patients were diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Bacterial etiology was determined, along with their susceptibility patterns. Neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, fever, duration of fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (38%) were diagnosed with acute leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, or brain tumors; those patients experienced 111 episodes of bacteremia. The most common Gram-positive (n=64 [55%]) isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26), Staphylococcus hominis (n=9), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=7), and the common Gram-negative (n=52 [45%]) isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), and Escherichia coli (n=7). There was a significant association observed between fever with positive blood culture and different types of cancer (P=0.035). The majority of bacteremia (n=68 [61.3%]) occurred in nonneutropenic episodes. Elevated values of CRP (>/=5 mg/L) were detected in 82 (95.3%) episodes and were negatively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (r=-0.18; P=0.248) among all cases. However, the infection-related fatality rate was 2.2% (n=4), with three caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Multidrug resistant organisms were implicated in 33 (28.4%) cases and caused three of the mortality cases. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant organisms cause mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the surveillance and quality of pediatric malignancy care.
TI  - Three-year study of health care-associated infections in a Turkish pediatric ward.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) can cause an increase in  morbidity, mortality and costs, especially in developing countries. As information on the epidemiology of HCAIs in pediatric patientsinTurkey is limited, we decided to study the annual incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns in our pediatric ward at Marmara University Hospital. METHODOLOGY: All hospitalized patients in the pediatric ward were assessed with regard to HCAIs between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. Data was prospectively collected according to standard protocols of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NosoLINE). RESULTS: A total of 16.5% of all hospitalized patients developed HCAIs in the three years studied. The most frequent HCAIs were urinary tract infections (UTI) (29.3%), bloodstream infections (27%) and pneumonias (21%). While the most frequent agent isolatedfrom UTI was Escherichia coli (26%), the most common agent in blood stream infections was Staphylococcus epidermidis (30.4%). Vancomycin resistance was found in 73.3% of all Enterococcus faecium strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was detected in 58.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Continual HCAI surveillance is important to determineits rate. Knowledge of the HCAI incidence can influence people's use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and encourage antibiotic rotation. Moreover, the knowledge of HCAI incidence may support the infection control programmes, including education and isolation methods which ultimately may help to reducethe rate of the HCAIs.
TI  - Etiologic diagnosis and clinical treatment of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia after neurosurgery.
AB  - Our objective is to analyze the etiology and antibiotics resistance rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia from Neurosurgery Department, providing a reference for clinical treatment. Sputum of 372 elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) from Neurosurgery Department was collected for sputum culture and drug sensitivity test, and pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance rate of antibiotics were discussed. Among 372 pathogenic bacteria, there were 95 cases with Gram-positive cocci, the percentage was 15.32 %; there were 277 cases with Gram-negative bacilli, the percentage was 59.95 %; there were 54 cases with fungus, the percentage was 14.51 %; the common Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with percentages of 15.32 %, 2.96 % and 4.30 % respectively; the common Gram-negative bacilli included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with percentages of 23.92 %, 14.25 % and 9.95 % respectively; the highest drug resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus were 100.00 % to penicillin, erythrocin and oxacillin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 87.50 % to erythrocin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus was 100.00 % to penicillin and erythrocin, the lowest drug resistance rates of three Gram-negative bacilli were 0 % to teicoplanin and vancomycin; the highest drug resistance rates of Escherichia coli were 100.00 % to ceftriaxone and ticarcillin, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 11.32 % to ciprofloxacin; the highest drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100.00 % to ceftriaxone, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 22.47 % to imipenem; the highest drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 81.08 % to aztreonam, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 0.00 % to imipenem. Stroke-associated pneumonia is common clinically in elderly patients from Neurology Department, the early-stage and rational use of antibiotics should be applied according to the etiologic distribution and drug resistance characteristics. Meanwhile, prevention measures should be applied.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological characteristic of infectious purulent complications in patients after related renal transplantation].
AB  - We investigated the frequency and characteristics of infectious purulent and non-infectious complications in living related renal transplant recipients in early postoperative period. It was identified the prevalent microorganisms in urinary tract infections and its antibiotic sensitivity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans. 182 strains of bacteria and Candida were isolated from urine of renal graft patients in early postoperative period (from 2 days to 3 months). The prevention and treatment schemes, antimicrobial drugs dosing regimen were developed. It leads to decrease the infectious complications rate.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fermented Theobroma cacao pod husk extract.
AB  - Theobroma cacao L. contains more than 500 different chemical compounds some of which have been traditionally used for their antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, immunomodulatory, vasodilatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities. Spontaneous aerobic fermentation of cacao husks yields a crude husk extract (CHE) with antimicrobial activity. CHE was fractioned by solvent partition with polar solvent extraction or by silica gel chromatography and a total of 12 sub-fractions were analyzed for chemical composition and bioactivity. CHE was effective against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the basidiomycete Moniliophthora perniciosa. Antibacterial activity was determined using 6 strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella choleraesuis (Gram-negative). At doses up to 10 mg/mL, CHE was not effective against the Gram-positive bacteria tested but against medically important P. aeruginosa and S. choleraesuis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5.0 mg/mL. Sub-fractions varied widely in activity and strongest antibacterial activity was seen with CHE8 against S. choleraesuis (MIC of 1.0 mg/mL) and CHE9 against S. epidermidis (MIC of 2.5 mg/mL). All bioactive CHE fractions contained phenols, steroids, or terpenes, but no saponins. Fraction CHE9 contained flavonoids, phenolics, steroids, and terpenes, amino acids, and alkaloids, while CHE12 had the same compounds but lacked flavonoids.
TI  - Functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; PL-5, PL-31, PL-32, PL-18, PL-29 and PL-26), alone or in combination, against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and PL-5 against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. Traditional antibiotics and AMPs showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. A strong synergistic effect in the PL-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against Staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of AMPs and traditional antibiotics. The combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
TI  - The influence of urinary pH on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of pH on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. Numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including pH. Because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (pH 4.5) to alkaline (pH 8) conditions and can be easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of pH in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) over the range of pH 5-8. Standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. One-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (P <.05). RESULTS: For 18 of the 24 agents, pH was shown to play a significant role in overall inhibitory activity. Although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed pH-dependent effects against certain organisms. The fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline pH, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. Sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by pH. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the urinary pH of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. Future clinical investigations examining urinary pH and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.
TI  - Quantification of polyphenols and evaluation of antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Vast numbers of plant species from northeastern Brazil have not yet been phytochemically or biologically evaluated. AIM OF THE STUDY: The goal of this work was to obtain, characterize and show the antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Libidibia ferrea, Parapiptadenia rigida and Psidium guajava. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant material (100g) was dried, and the crude extracts were obtained by using turbo-extraction (10%; w/v) with water or acetone:water (7:3, v/v) as the extraction solvent. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were used to screen the crude extracts for hydrolysable tannins (gallic acid) and condensed tannins (catechins). The antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar-diffusion and microdilution methods against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis INCQS 00016, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) as well as Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Salmonella enteritidis INCQS 00258, Shigella flexneri and Klebsiella pneumoniae). To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity, a leukocyte migration model was used. Analgesic activity was determined by the hot plate test and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Parapiptadenia rigida presented the highest amount of total polyphenols (35.82 +/- 0.20%), while the greatest catechin content was found in the acetone-water extract of Psidium guajava (EAWPg; 1.04 mug/g). The largest amounts of catechins were found in the aqueous extract of Libidibia ferrea (EALf; 1.07 mug/g) and the acetone-water extract of Parapiptadenia rigida (EAWPr; 1.0 mug/g). All extracts showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The aqueous and acetone-water extracts of Psidium guajava showed the greatest inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests. In the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the most susceptible Gram-positive bacterium was Staphylococcus epidermidis and the most susceptible Gram-negative bacterium was Shigella flexneri. EAPg and EAWPg showed the greatest MIC values. All extracts were significant inhibitors of leukocyte migration (p<0.05). Using the writhing test, significant analgesic activity was found for EAPr (50 mg/kg), EAWPr (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and EAWPg (50 mg/kg) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the appropriate extraction procedure preserves the chemical components such as gallic acid and catechin, and showed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.
TI  - Highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an Iraqi burn care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. Increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. We describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in Iraq. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between July 2008 and September 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in Iraq who developed sepsis. RESULTS: In 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. Sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% CI 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. The most commonly isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), Staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and Enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). A high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and S. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. For gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burn patients with sepsis in Iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. Effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of Iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria via photosensitization of vitamin K3 by UV-A light.
AB  - This study investigated inactivation of bacteria with ultraviolet light A irradiation in combination with vitamin K3 as a photosensitizer. Six bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli suspended in vitamin K3 aqueous solution were exposed to ultraviolet light A. Five of six bacteria, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were reduced by eight logs with 1600 muM of vitamin K3 and 5.8 J cm(-2) UV-A irradiation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by four logs under these conditions. Reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical were generated in vitamin K3 aqueous solution under UV-A irradiation. These results suggest that vitamin K3 and UV-A irradiation may be effective for bacterial inactivation in environmental and medical applications.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial effect of S53P4 bioactive glass and gentamicin impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads.
AB  - Osteomyelitis is a disease that is still difficult to treat, with considerable morbidity and associated costs. The current "gold standard" in treatment - debridement and implantation of antibiotic impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads - presents the disadvantage of a second surgical intervention required for the removal of the beads. We comparatively investigated the in vitro antibacterial effect of S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) and gentamicin impregnated PMMA beads. Bacterial viability was assessed hourly by Standard Plate Count during 24 hours of incubation, by determining the number of colony forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both tested materials showed an antibacterial effect on all studied bacteria. In case of S. aureus, BAG granules were almost as effective as gentamicin impregnated PMMA beads, with no statistically significant differences. In contrast, PMMA beads had a superior antibacterial effect on S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae. The antibacterial effect of BAG was greatly influenced by granule size and contact time. There was a statistically significant correlation between pH values and the number of CFU in the case of S53P4 BAG granules. As a biocompatible and biodegradable bone substitute, S53P4 bioactive glass can be a good alternative in the local management of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Anti-biofilm activity: a function of Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - Competition and cooperation phenomena occur within highly interactive biofilm communities and several non-biocides molecules produced by microorganisms have been described as impairing biofilm formation. In this study, we investigated the anti-biofilm capacities of an ubiquitous and biofilm producing bacterium, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cell-free supernatant from K. pneumoniae planktonic cultures showed anti-biofilm effects on most Gram positive bacteria tested but also encompassed some Gram negative bacilli. The anti-biofilm non-bactericidal activity was further investigated on Staphylococcus epidermidis, by determining the biofilm biomass, microscopic observations and agglutination measurement through a magnetic bead-mediated agglutination test. Cell-free extracts from K. pneumoniae biofilm (supernatant and acellular matrix) also showed an influence, although to a lesser extend. Chemical analyses indicated that the active molecule was a high molecular weight polysaccharide composed of five monosaccharides: galactose, glucose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid and glucosamine and the main following sugar linkage residues [--> 2)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -->]; [--> 4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1 -->]; [alpha-D-Galp-(1 -->]; [--> 2,3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1 -->]; [--> 3)-beta-D-Galp-(1 -->] and, [--> 4)-beta-D-GlcAp-(1 -->]. Characterization of this molecule indicated that this component was more likely capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and precoating of abiotic surfaces with CPS extracts from different serotypes impaired the bacteria-surface interactions. Thus the CPS of Klebsiella would exhibit a pleiotropic activity during biofilm formation, both stimulating the initial adhesion and maturation steps as previously described, but also repelling potential competitors.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Phyllanthus wightianus Mull. Arg.: a potential source for natural antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phyllanthus wightianus belongs to Euphorbiaceae family having ethnobotanical importance. The present study deals with validating the antimicrobial potential of solvent leaf extracts of P. wightianus. 11 human bacterial pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens) and 4 fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor racemosus, and Aspergillus niger) were also challenged with solvent leaf extracts usingagar well and disc diffusion methods. Further, identification of the active component present in the bioactive extract was done using GC-MS analysis. Results show that all extracts exhibited broad spectrum (6-29 mm) of antibacterial activity on most of the tested organisms. The results highlight the fact that the well in agar method was more effective than disc diffusion method. Significant antimicrobial activity was detected in methanol extract against S. pneumoniae (29 mm) with MIC and MBC values of 15.62 mug/mL. GC-MS analysis revealed that 29 bioactive constituents were present in methanolic extract of P. wightianus, of which 9,12-octadecaenioic acid (peak area 22.82%; RT-23.97) and N-hexadecanoic acid (peak area 21.55% RT-21.796) are the major compounds. The findings of this study show that P. wightianus extracts may be used as an anti-infective agent in folklore medicine.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of alcohol solution in community hospital and health centers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bactericidal efficacy of alcohol solution during actual use and typical storage conditions in community hospital and health centers. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The alcohol samples were collected immediately after the first bottle-opening (day 0) and on day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 30 from 10 stations in hospital and community health centers in Pone-na-kaew district, Sakon Nakhon province, Thailand, during May-July 2011. Bactericidal efficacy of these samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae was evaluated. Ethanol concentration was quantified by a gas chromatography method. RESULTS: Bactericidal efficacy of the alcohol samples still remained on day 30 with ethanol concentration range of 60.91-65.99% v/v. CONCLUSION: This finding should be considered as a cost-benefit model for using alcohol solution in community hospital and health centers.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. Antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. We sought to determine an effective antibiotic in PMMA beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. METHODS: PMMA beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. Antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. Beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. RESULTS: Daptomycin alone was not active against K. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). Tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. Meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. The addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. The presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic PMMA beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. The addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. Further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - Biofilms on indwelling urologic devices: microbes and antimicrobial management prospect.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms (BFs) are a potential source of highly resistant infections, frequently formed on devicesand pose problems for management. AIM: This study was to develop rational approach for prevention of indwelling urologic device associated biofilm colonization. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From randomly selected patients visiting Department of Urology of a tertiary hospital in India 150 uro catheters and 31 used ureteric stents, in-situ for > 30, were collected aseptically. The organisms were isolated and identified from washed devices dipped in broth. Evidence of bacteriuria in each case was checked by semi-quantitative method of urine culture, on day 0 and 14 of device use. The BF statuses of the device-adhered organisms were confirmed by modified method of Christensen. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion method. Data were analyzed using the Graphpad Prism version 5 statistical software. RESULTS: Both single and multi-species BFs were formed on catheters, whereas mono-bacterial BFs were exclusive on stents. Predominant organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.67%,69/225,) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15.11%, 34/225), Escherichia coli (13.78%, 31/225), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%, 27/225), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.44%, 19/225). Of all strains, (89.33%, 201/225) were found to be BF positive and their colonizations were early indicated by the presence of insignificant bacteriuria in follow-up urine samples. All BF isolates were resistant to at least three antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: BF colonization was almost inevitable in prolonged used urinary devices and the most frequent organisms were Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia spp. Their colonizations usually were indicated by insignificant bacteriuria from follow-up samples. Such BF dislodged organisms were multidrug resistant and could be a source of disseminated infection, yet were in-vitro preventable by many drugs.
TI  - Rapid detection of contaminant bacteria in platelet concentrate using differential impedance.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current FDA-approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrate (PC) can yield false-negative results attributed to Poisson-limited sampling errors incurred near the time of collection that result in undetectable bacterial concentrations. Testing PC at the point of issue (POI) extends the incubation period for any contaminant bacteria increasing the probability of detection. Data are presented from time-course experiments designed to simulate POI testing of bacterially contaminated PCs at different stages of growth using differential impedance sensing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole-blood-derived PCs were typically spiked with low numbers of bacteria (approximately 100 CFU/ml) and incubated under standard PC storage conditions. Each infected unit was evaluated every two hours over a 12-h period. All samples were treated with a chemical compound that induces stress in the bacterial cells only. The development of any bacterial stress was monitored by detecting changes in the dielectric properties of the PC using differential impedance. RESULTS: Differential impedance measurements and corresponding cell counts at the different time-points are presented for six organisms implicated in post-transfusion-septic reactions. All infected PCs were detected once contaminant bacteria reached concentrations ranging between 0.6 x 10(3) and 6 x 10(3) CFU/ml irrespective of the phase of growth. Results were obtained within 30 min after the start of the assay and without the need for cell lysis or centrifugation. CONCLUSION: Differential impedance sensing can detect bacterial contamination in PC rapidly at concentrations below clinical thresholds known to cause adverse effects.
TI  - Next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  - Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - Microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (VLBW, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. We hypothesize the built environment (BE), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature VLBW infants. Here, we present the first matched fecal-BE time series analysis of two preterm VLBW neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) over the first month of life. RESULTS: Fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 device. For each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each NICU room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). Swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (EMIRGE) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16S rRNA amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an Illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. Over 24,000 full-length 16S rRNA sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. Dominant gut taxa, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. Reconstructed genomes from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the NICU environment. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. The approach enabled identification of discrete ICU reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.
TI  - Antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of DispersinB(R)-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  - The medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. As the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of DispersinB((R)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum KSL-W antimicrobial peptide. The combination of DispersinB((R)) and KSL-W peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), and Acinetobacter baumannii. In addition, the wound gel formulation comprising DispersinB((R)), KSL-W peptide, and a gelling agent Pluronic F-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. Furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel Silver-Sept, DispersinB((R))-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded MRSA, S. epidermidis, CoNS, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05). Thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial DispersinB((R))-KSL-W wound gel in chronic wound management.
TI  - Current pattern of antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates among conjunctival  swabs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the etiological agent in bacterial conjunctivitis and to  determine the antibiogram of bacterial isolates. METHODOLOGY: This observational study was conducted at Dr. Essa's Laboratory over a period of 12 months ending in March 2012. Two hundred samples taken from conjunctiva of patients with conjunctivitis were cultured on routine medium and the antibiograms of bacterial isolates were determined by Kirby- Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The analysis of the culture showed that 41% were cultured positive with gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 52.5% and Staphylococcus epidermidis 30.1% and Micrococci 8.3%. However, 9.1% were gram negatives with Klebsiella pneumoniae 5.14% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2.6% and 1.36% were others (Acinetobacter, Haemophilus , E.coli and Moraxella) keeping in view the increasing use of contact lens and unclean fingers. The overall antibiograms of bacterial isolates indicate aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramicin) and the newer quinolones as apparent drug of choice for empirical therapy, followed by chloramphenicol, since drug fussy gram-negatives such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and E.coli were among the conjunctival isolates. Resistance profile of gram positive isolates shows cefixime 91.4%, doxycycline 57.9%, cotrimoxazole 29.3%, ampicillin 22.9%, ciprofloxacin 13.4%, cephradine 8.3%, cefuroxime 7.1%, fosfomycin 4.7%, ceftriaxone 3.6%, co-amoxiclav 3.6%, cefotaxime 3.5%, vancomycin 2.6%. CONCLUSION: Resistance to all conventionally used antibiotics is increasing, therefore identification of etiological agent and antibiogram is important to treat conjunctivitis and to avoid complications.
TI  - Characteristics of urinary tract infection pathogens and their in vitro susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in China: data from a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the characteristics of pathogens identified in clinical isolates from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) and their in vitro sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics in the clinical setting in China. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multicenter study was conducted between January and December 2011 in 12 hospitals in China. PARTICIPANTS: Urine samples were collected from 356 symptomatic patients treated in the study hospitals for acute uncomplicated cystitis, recurrent UTI or complicated UTI. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2011 guidelines. Thirteen antimicrobial agents were tested: fosfomycin tromethamine, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, cefdinir, cefixime, cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, azithromycin, nitrofurantoin and oxacillin. Escherichia coli isolates were screened and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) production was confirmed by a double-disk synergy test. RESULTS: 198 urine samples were culture-positive and 175 isolates were included in the final analysis. E coli was detected in 50% of cultures, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (9%), Enterococcus faecalis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). The detection rate of ESBL-producing E coli was 53%. Resistance to levofloxacin was the most common among all the isolates. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin tromethamine had the greatest activity against E coli; overall, 92% and 91% of isolates were susceptible to these antimicrobials. E faecalis had the highest susceptibility rates to fosfomycin tromethamine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently identified pathogens in our patients were ESBL-producing E coli and E faecalis. Fosfomycin tromethamine and nitrofurantoin showed a good antimicrobial activity against UTI pathogens. They may represent good options for the empiric treatment of patients with UTI.
TI  - Comparison of biofilm and attachment mechanisms of a phytopathological and clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae Subsp. pneumoniae.
AB  - Some bacterial species can colonize humans and plants. It is almost impossible to prevent the contact of clinically pathogenic bacteria with food crops, and if they can persist there, they can reenter the human food chain and cause disease. On the leaf surface, microorganisms are exposed to a number of stress factors. It is unclear how they survive in such different environments. By increasing adhesion to diverse substrates, minimizing environmental differences, and providing protection against defence mechanisms, biofilms could provide part of the answer. Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae is clinically important and also associated with fruit diseases, such as "pineapple fruit collapse." We aimed to characterize biofilm formation and adhesion mechanisms of this species isolated from pineapple in comparison with a clinical isolate. No differences were found between the two isolates quantitatively or qualitatively. Both tested positive for capsule formation and were hydrophobic, but neither produced adherence fibres, which might account for their relatively weak adhesion compared to the positive control Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984. Both produced biofilms on glass and polystyrene, more consistently at 40 degrees C than 35 degrees C, confirmed by atomic force and high-vacuum scanning electron microscopy. Biofilm formation was maintained in an acidic environment, which may be relevant phytopathologically.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and elution kinetics of linezolid from polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  - Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) impregnated with antibiotics is widely used in the  treatment of osteomyelitis and infected arthroplasties. With the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, linezolid, which is active against gram-positive bacteria and toward which resistance has been scarce, has been suggested as an alternative. In the current in vitro study, the authors sought to determine and compare the efficacy and elution kinetics of linezolid from PMMA. Polymethylmethacrylate beads impregnated with linezolid, vancomycin, or gentamicin alone and in combinations were placed in suspensions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The leaching out concentrations of antibiotics and growth inhibitory time in days were recorded. The mechanical strength of cement beads was evaluated in accordance with International Standard 5833. The growth inhibitory time of linezolid was significantly longer than that of vancomycin and gentamicin for methicillin-resistant S aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and S epidermidis. The combination of linezolid with gentamicin and vancomycin significantly increased the growth inhibitory time compared with either antibiotic used alone. Linezolid alone or in combination with vancomycin and gentamicin showed satisfactory elution kinetics and antimicrobial activity in vitro without compromising the mechanical strength of PMMA. Future research evaluating the in vivo profile of linezolid-loaded PMMA in experimental animals is needed before it can be considered for human use.
TI  - A novel approach for rapid detection of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates via sensitive measurement of microbial DNA polymerase activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates (PCs) can result in serious health consequences for the affected patient. Before being released from blood banking facilities, PCs are routinely screened for bacterial contamination by culture-based tests. However, culture-based PC screening methods require extended holding and incubation periods and are prone to false-negative results due to sampling error. Screening PCs closer to the time of transfusion using rapid point-of-issue tests represents an alternative approach; however, FDA-approved assays generally suffer from a lack of sensitivity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Presented herein is the feasibility of a novel approach toward rapid, sensitive, and universal detection of bacterially contaminated PCs via selective measurement of microbial DNA polymerase activity. This approach is achieved using a differential cell lysis procedure in combination with enzymatic template generation and amplification (termed ETGA-PC assay). RESULTS: Serial dilution spiking experiments revealed an approximate sensitivity of 30 to 200 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL (mean, 85 CFUs/mL) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. An additional 22 clinically relevant strains of bacteria were also detected below 200 CFUs/mL after spiking into PC aliquots. Furthermore, the ETGA-PC assay was able to accurately monitor the presence and growth of seven clinically relevant bacterial species that were spiked into PC units. CONCLUSION: Together, the data presented here demonstrate that the ETGA-PC assay is a feasible approach for rapid and sensitive detection of bacterially contaminated PCs. Experiments, aimed at simplification and/or automation of the assay procedure, are under way.
TI  - Emergence of Enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in South Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in South Korea. METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 January 2004 and 31 July 31 2010 were reviewed. Four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. Outcome measures were culture-proven infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in the patients. RESULTS: A total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. The positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). The most common organisms identified were Enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %, 6/96), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). Two cases of Enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. Overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were Gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. The most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of E. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of E. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. This increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.
TI  - [Distribution and antibiotics resistance related to nosocomial pathogenic bacteria infection in patients after cardiac surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical distribution and antibiotics resistance of nosocomial infection caused pathogenic bacteria in patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Clinical data from 612 patients after cardiac surgery under microbiologically documented nosocomial infection was retrospectively analyzed from January 2007 to December 2012. Identification on related bacterial was performed in an automatic ATB Expression system while antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: were analyzed by WHONET5.4. RESULTS: There were 697 strains of clinical pathogenic bacilli isolates identified and 421 (60.4%) of them were isolated from sputum while 185 (26.5%) were from blood. Acinetobacter spp. (124 strains, 17.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85 strains, 12.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (50 strains, 7.2%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacilli while S. epidermidis (75 strains, 10.8%) was the predominant Gram-positive cocci. The predominant eumycete was Candida albicans (43 strains, 6.2%). RESULTS: from the susceptibility test showed that carbapenems, cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active antibiotics. The detection of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) were 82.9% in S aureus and 95.9% in coagulase negative Staphylococcus. There was no Staphylococcus strains resistant to vancomycin found. CONCLUSION: Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus appeared the important pathogens in patients after cardiac surgery. Drug resistance to antibiotics was quite common. Prevention on nosocomial infection and rational use of antibiotics remained very important in reducing the amount of drug resistant strains.
TI  - [Multi-center clinical trial of FLAMIGEL (hydrogel dressing) for the treatment of residual burn wound].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of FLAMIGEL (hydrogel dressing) on the repair of residual burn wound. METHODS: Sixty burn patients with residual wounds hospitalized in 6 burn units from November 2011 to May 2012 were enrolled in the multi-center, randomized, and self-control clinical trial. Two residual wounds of each patient were divided into groups T (treated with FLAMIGEL) and C (treated with iodophor gauze) according to the random number table. On post treatment day (PTD) 7 and 14, wound healing rate was calculated, with the number of completely healed wound counted. The degree of pain patient felt during dressing change was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The mean numbers of wounds with score equal to zero, more than zero and less than or equal to 3, more than 3 and less than or equal to 6, more than 6 and less than or equal to 10 were recorded respectively. Wound secretion or exudate samples were collected for bacterial culture, and the side effect was observed. Data were processed with repeated measure analysis of variance, t test, chi-square test, and nonparametric rank sum test. RESULTS: Wound healing rate of groups T, C on PTD 7 was respectively (67 +/- 24)%, (45 +/- 25)%, and it was respectively (92 +/- 16)%, (72 +/- 23)% on PTD 14. There was statistically significant difference in wound healing rate on PTD 7, 14 between group T and group C (F = 32.388, P < 0.01). Ten wounds in group T and four wounds in group C were healed completely on PTD 7, with no significant difference between them (chi(2) = 0, P > 0.05). Forty-two wounds in group T and seven wounds in group C healed completely on PTD 14, with statistically significant difference between them (chi(2) = 42.254, P < 0.01). Patients in group T felt mild pain during dressing change for 37 wounds, with VAS score higher than zero and lower than or equal to 3. Evident pain was observed in patients of group C during dressing change for 43 wounds, and it scored higher than 3 and less than or equal to 6 by VAS evaluation. There was statistically significant difference in mean number of wounds with different grade of VAS score between group T and group C (Z = -4.638, P < 0.01). Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Baumanii, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were all detected in both groups, but there was no statistical difference between group T and group C (chi(2) = 0.051, P > 0.05). No side effect was observed in either of the two groups during the whole trial. CONCLUSIONS: FLAMIGEL can accelerate the healing of residual burn wounds and obviously relieve painful sensation during dressing change.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Demonic axe-like conjugated alkynes in combating microbes.
AB  - A new series of disubstituted alkynes was obtained by microwave induced internal  splitting of the corresponding beta-oxo-alkylidenetriphenylphosphoranes. The antimicrobial potential of these conjugated alkynes and phosphoranes was assayed in vitro against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis), three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and five fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Candida rugosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The 3-pyridylalkyne derivatives viz., 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6a), 3-(2-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6b), ethyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6c), iso-propyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6d) and 3-(2,6-dichloro-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6e) were found to be highly potent towards all tested microorganisms except E. coli.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. We have recently shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides named PD1-PD4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of Arg-Trp (RW1-RW5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. In the present study, we selected PD3, PD4, RW2, RW3 and RW4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. Stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. Analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. The peptide combinations (RW2 + RW4, RW2 + RW3 + RW4 and PD4 + RW3 + RW4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 muM. Time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. The present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been explored in this setting. AIMS: This study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. METHOD: Glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. Following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rDNA sequencing. Methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, Epsilon tests and PCR. Gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. RESULTS: Total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. Environmental bacteria, particularly Bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. Half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. Enterococcus faecalis , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. Significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. CONCLUSION: Health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. Findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - Opportunistic microorganisms in individuals with lesions of denture stomatitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate, quantify, identify, and compare opportunistic microorganisms (Candida and Staphylococcus genera and Enterobacteriaceae/Pseudomonadaceae families) from prosthesis-fitting surfaces, the hard palate, and mouth rinses of individuals wearing removable maxillary prosthesis with (50) and without (50) lesions of denture stomatitis (DS). The strains were collected and identified using phenotypic, biochemical and molecular tests. The counts of microorganisms were significantly higher in the group of individuals with DS (P < 0.05). C. albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast species in both groups, following by C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Six isolates were identified as C. dubliniensis. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were the most frequent Staphylococcus species in both groups. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant species in both groups. The association between Candida spp. and bacteria isolated in this study with DS suggests that these microorganisms may play important roles in the establishment and persistence of this disease.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of disinfection protocols used for needleless connectors of central venous catheters.
AB  - A repeatable and sensitive method to evaluate the effect of three antiseptics and two disinfection techniques on viable micro-organisms on luer-activated catheter needleless connectors (NCs) was developed. NCs were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Klebsiella pneumoniae and disinfected with 3.15% chlorhexidine gluconate + 70% isopropanol (CGI), 70% isopropanol (IPA) or 10% PVP povidone-iodine (PI) antiseptic pads using: (i) scrubbing the NC septum and threaded external surfaces or (ii) wiping only the surface of the septum. Treatments were also evaluated against NCs pretreated with human serum and exposed for 18 h to Staph. epidermidis prior to testing. Viable cells were quantified by plate count. The method for inoculation and recovery of luminal micro-organisms was repeatable (SD, 0.31; n = 28). IPA disinfection provided an approximate 3 log10 CFU reduction; CGI and PI provided 3-4 log10 reductions. PI and CGI were more effective than IPA (P < 0.05), but differences between CGI and PI were not significant for either disinfection method. IPA, but not CGI and PI was also less effective (P < 0.05) against NCs inoculated with Kl. pneumoniae than Staph. epidermidis. Pretreatment with serum and prolonged Staph. epidermidis inoculation removed the advantage seen with CGI and PI; log10 reductions were 1.80, 1.73 and 2.50 for CGI, PI and IPA, respectively. PI or CGI may be more effective than IPA for NC disinfection but effectiveness may be reduced on NCs contaminated with blood or serum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: sensitive and repeatable protocol was developed to evaluate antiseptics for disinfecting catheter needleless connectors (NCs). Povidone-iodine (PI) and chlorhexidine gluconate plus isopropanol (CGI) were more effective than isopropanol (IPA) for reducing Staphylococcus epidermidis contamination of NCs. The effectiveness of PI and CGI was reduced on NCs pre-exposed to human serum and prolonged bacterial inoculation. IPA was also less effective against NCs contaminated with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of cyclodextrin-antiseptics-complexes determined by microplate laser nephelometry and ATP bioluminescence assay.
AB  - Cyclodextrins (CDs) are able to form inclusion complexes with other molecules, thereby, protecting these guest molecules from degradation, enhancing their biocompatibility or influencing their physiological distribution while retaining their activity. Here, antibacterial effects of CD-complexes with the antiseptics chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX), iodine (IOD) and polihexanide (PHMB) were determined using two different in vitro methods, microplate laser nephelometry and an ATP bioluminescence assay. Laser nephelometry is a direct method for monitoring and evaluating growth of micro-organisms by measurement of the turbidity of the solution. In contrast, the ATP bioluminescence assay determines specifically the amount of metabolic active bacterial cells. The antibacterial effects of CD-antiseptics-complexes were examined for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and the results of both methods were compared in respect of calculated means of half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and statistical evaluated Pearson's correlation coefficients (r). It could be demonstrated that both methods showed a high comparability although they differ in the parameters tested. This study revealed that CD-complexes with CHX and PHMB were most effective against E. coli and the tested staphylococci. While CD-IOD-complexes obtained high activity against K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa was distinctly more resistant compared to the other bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides.
AB  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity (MIC) of novel 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides 2 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained in the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium 3-thiolates 1 with sulfonyl chlorides. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 was investigated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum and Gram-negative Escherichia coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains as well as Candida albicans. The investigated compounds exhibited growth-inhibitory activity towards Gram-positive bacteria in the 4-64 microg/mL range whereas that towards Gram-negative bacteria covered the 128-1024 microg/mL range. The highest activity was shown by compound 2c, featuring a phenylsulfonylthio substituent in the 3-quinoline position and a 4-chlorophenylamine group in the position 4. All of the investigated compounds 2 showed antifungal activity in the 32-128 microg/mL range. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - [Species and drug resistance of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the species and percentage changes of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward, and to analyze the drug resistance of main pathogens and the risk factors for positive blood culture (sepsis). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to analyze the species and drug sensitivity of the pathogens isolated from 2358 blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward of the West China Second University Hospital between 2008 and 2011, as well as the related clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 110 strains of pathogens were isolated, with Escherichia coli (16 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12 strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8 strains) being the most common ones. From 2008 to 2011, the percentage of Gram-positive bacteria decreased, while the percentage of Gram-negative bacteria increased. The detection rates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were 69% and 43% respectively, but both were sensitive to vancomycin. The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae were 69% and 62% respectively, but both were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Malignant tumor was a risk factor for positive blood culture (OR=3.564, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of pathogens are responsible for bloodstream infection in the pediatric hematology ward and the percentages of bacteria are changing; these pathogens have a high drug resistance rate. Malignant tumor is a risk factor for positive blood culture in the pediatric hematology ward.
TI  - Cytotoxic (A549) and antimicrobial effects of Methylobacterium sp. isolate (ERI-135) from Nilgiris forest soil, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Methylobacterium  sp. isolated from soil sample of Doddabetta forest, Nilgiris, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Isolation of Methylobacterium was performed from soils by serial dilution plate technique. The strain was grown in modified nutrient gulucose agar (MNGA) medium to study the morphology and biochemical characteristics. Methylobacterium sp. was screened for its antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The strain was subjected to 16S rRNA analysis and was identified as Methylobacterium sp. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate exhibited close similarity with other Methylobacterium sp. and has been submitted to Genbank. The antibacterial substances were extracted using chloroform and ethyl acetate from MNGA medium in which ERI-135 had grown for 5 d at 30 degrees C. Cytotoxic effect was also studied. GC-MS analysis was carried out. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro dilution technique. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate extract showed activity against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureu and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and fungi such as, Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were: 250 microg/mL against S. epidermidis and 250microg/mL against K. pneumonia. The isolate had the ability to produce enzymes such as protease. The exyract showed cytotoxic effect in human adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of isovaleric acid (3.64%), 2-Methylbutanoic acid (5.03%), isobutyramide (5.05%), N,N-oimethylformamide-di-t-butylacetal (9.79%), benzeneacetamide (15.56%), octyl butyl phthalate (3.59%) and diisooctyl phthalate (5.79) in the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Methylobacterium sp. (ERI-135) showed promising antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. This is the first report in the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Methylobacterium sp.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - [Pathogen distribution and risk factors of nosocomial infections in neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogen distribution and risk factors of nosocomial infections in neonates in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU). METHODS: The clinical data of 145 neonates with nosocomial infection in the NICU were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 145 neonates, 41 (28.3%) were infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, 39 (26.9%) with Escherichia coli, 10 (6.9%) with Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 55 (37.9%) with other pathogens. Logistic regression analysis showed that a gestational age of </=32 weeks (OR=5.57), birth weigh of <1500 g (OR=6.95), hospitalization time (OR=1.23), mechanical ventilation (OR=14.12) and parenteral nutrition (OR=3.01) were major risk factors for nosocomial infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five factors were also main risk factors for nosocomial infection caused by Escherichia coli, with the OR of 3.42, 6.73, 9.96, 0.55 and 2.13 respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics but were relatively sensitive to levofloxacin and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis are major pathogens of nosocomial infections in neonates in the NICU and they are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Mechanical ventilation and hospitalization time are the most important risk factors for nosocomial infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam.
AB  - 4-(alpha-L-Rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from Moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. Isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all Gram-positive bacteria tested (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi E. floccosum and T. rubrum. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (IZ) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against S. aureus, good to moderate activity against S. epidermidis, moderate activity against B. subtilis, and weak activity against E. floccosum and T. rubrum. The in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the Gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by MBC:MIC ratios of 2:1.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of DNA aptamers against Escherichia coli using a bacterial cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment approach.
AB  - Aptamers are powerful capturing probes against various targets such as proteins,  small organic compounds, metal ions, and even cells. In this study, we isolated and characterized single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers against Escherichia coli. A total of 28 ssDNAs were isolated after 10 rounds of selection using a bacterial cell-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process. Other bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were used for counter selection to enhance the selectivity of ssDNA aptamers against E. coli. Finally, four ssDNA aptamers showed high affinity and selectivity to E. coli, The dissociation constants (K(d)) of these four ssDNA aptamers to E. coli were estimated to range from 12.4 to 25.2 nM. These aptamers did not bind to other bacterial species, including four counter cells, but they showed affinity to different E. coli strains. The binding of these four aptamers to E. coli was observed directly by fluorescence microscopy.
TI  - Biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. To date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) species in the context of numerous types of infectious syndromes. Herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. METHODS: The biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) (n=23), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and Escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and MDR phenotype were evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. RESULTS: Of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the Staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more frequently observed to be MDR. In patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be strong biofilm producers in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. Our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues, (3) MDR pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.
TI  - [Vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis that were treated in Peking Union Hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. Twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. Pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. Hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. Severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. The fundus could not be observed in all 20 eyes. B-Scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. At the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and Gram stained. To eyes that showed a positive result in Gram staining, 1 mg of Vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (balanced salt solution, BSS) in the eyes. To eyes that showed a negative result in Gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of Ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (BSS) in the eyes, respectively. Additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. The antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. The follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). RESULTS: Thirteen eyes presented with a positive Gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. Bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. The detection rate of pathogen was 75%. The result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. The bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and Bacillus spp in 2 eyes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Loffi Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. The remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. The intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. The visual acuity was significantly elevated. Postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 3 eyes and LP in 1 eye. The retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. We obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by Gram staining. It is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.
TI  - Chemical and antimicrobial studies on the essential oil from Salvia santolinifolia Boiss.
AB  - In view of the reputation of genus Salvia in folklore medicine and its abundance  in our region, the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil from S. santolinifolia Boiss. was analyzed. Chemical analysis, using gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, retention indices and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has resulted in identification of 116 constituents, comprising about 97% of the total constituents. Out of these 116, 78 constituents are hitherto unreported from this source. The species belongs to alpha-pinene chemotype. In antibacterial assay, gram negative gastropathogens (Shigella boydii, S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae); causative agent of urinary tract infection (Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris) and pneumonia (Klebsiella pneumoniae) were found sensitive to this essential oil while Corynebacteria species and Staphylococcus epidermidis were significantly inhibited in antibacterial assay against gram positive bacteria. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute protocol was used for determining antimicrobial activity. Thus the essential oil from this species can be utilized as potential chemotherapeutic agent.
TI  - Pathogenesis of bloodstream infection in children with blood cancer.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to characterize the distribution and antibiotic  resistance of pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in the Hematology and Oncology department of the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School (Hangzhou, China), between January and December 2010 and to provide early and appropriate support for the clinical administration of antibiotics. Out of 1,500 inpatients, 161 children who were diagnosed with BSI based on the national diagnostic criteria were retrospectively analyzed. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) in the peripheral blood of less than 0.5x10(9) cells/l. A microbiologically documented infection (MDI) was defined as when the causative pathogen was isolated from the blood. Drug susceptibility tests were performed using a VITEK-60 AutoMicrobic System and the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The data were analyzed using STATA software (version 9.0) and a two-sided P-value of </=0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. A total of 79 strains were isolated from the blood specimens. The incidence of BSI was 10.73% (161/1,500). Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 55.70, 43.04 and 1.27% of the BSIs, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis (20.25%), Escherichia coli (15.19%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.19%) were frequently identified isolates. The staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, while Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem and meropenem. In conclusion, Gram-positive bacteria are slightly more prevalent than Gram-negative bacteria in BSI and the selection of antibiotics according to the susceptibility test results is superior to empirical treatment. It is essential to administer antimicrobial agents early and appropriately to treat child blood cancer patients with BSI.
TI  - Infections secondary to pacemaker implantation: a synopsis of six cases.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Permanent cardiac pacing is a technique whose indications have increased in the last 20 years. As with any foreign body, pacemaker implantation is associated with the risk of infection. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical, paraclinical and treatment options of infections secondary to pacemaker implantation at the Cardiology Department of the Aristide le Dantec Teaching Hospital (CHU Aristide le Dantec) in Dakar, Senegal. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study over a period of three years (from January 2005 to December 2007) during which pacemaker implantation was carried out in 107 patients. All patients with local and/or systemic signs of infection were included in our study. RESULTS: The prevalence of infection in patients with pacemakers was 5.6% in our series and infection occurred in three women and three men, with a mean age of 66.2 years (range 23-83). The delay time for the onset of clinical signs of infection was 6.6 months, with a range of eight days to 12 months. The clinical signs were externalisation of the pacemaker with suppuration (five cases), fever (one case) and inflammatory signs (one case). Factors favouring the occurrence of infection were co-morbidity (four cases), pre-operative length of stay (average eight days), use of temporary cardiac pacing (three cases), the number of people in the theatre (average 4.5), postoperative haematoma (one case) and repeating the surgical procedure (three cases). Staphylococcus epidermidis (two cases), Staphylococcus aureus (two cases) and Klebsiella pneumonia (one case) were the organisms isolated at the local site. Transthoracic echocardiography showed no objective signs of endocarditis. The treatment was antibiotic therapy for an average duration of 50.4 days after debridement of the infected site (six cases). We noted four recurrences at six months and one death from sepsis at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Infections secondary to pacemaker implantation are rare but serious. Their management is difficult and requires the removal of the implanted material, hence the importance of prevention of infection, or the removal and re-implantation of the pacemaker at another site in cases of infection. This is particularly important in our region where pacemakers are very expensive.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of antimicrobial agents based on pyridazine moiety.
AB  - An efficient and simple microwave assisted synthesis of sulfonamide derivatives incorporating the pyridazine moiety has been developed. These sulfonamides were used for the preparation of new heterocyclic compounds via reaction with different reagents using a microwave irradiation technique. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed on the basis of FTIR, (1)H and (13)C-NMR, mass spectral techniques and elemental analyses. Some of the new synthesized compounds were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. Most of the new compounds showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections in liver transplantation: etiologic agents and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
AB  - Liver transplantation (OLT) is a lifesaving procedure for the treatment of many end-stage liver diseases, but infection and acute rejection episodes still remain the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Bloodstream infections (BSIs), particularly, are the major cause of mortality among these patients. BSIs in OLT, are from intra-abdominal, biliary, respiratory, urinary, wound and/or central venous catheter sources. A certain percentage are of unknown origin. Using the computerized database of our microbiology laboratory, we analyzed all BSIs in 75 consecutive adult liver transplant patients in a single center between January 2008 and July 2011. BSIs occurred in 21/75 (28%) patients. Thirteen subjects had a single; two, two episodes, and the other six patients each >4 episodes. All episodes occurred in the first 60 days following OLT; the majority (74%), in the first month. Among 44 microorganisms recovered, 52.3% were gram-negative, the most frequent being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 47.7% were gram-positive, the most frequent being coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis. Overall 65.9% of the isolates were resistant to several antibiotics: 40.9% displayed the multiding-resistant and 25% the panding-resistant phenotype. There was a high incidence of gram-negative and most importantly, resistant bacteria, which required appropriate therapy. These data showed that it is imperative to promote strategies to prevention and contain antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - DNA binding mode of novel tetradentate amino acid based 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine complexes.
AB  - Few transition metal complexes of tetradentate N(2)O(2) donor Schiff base ligands containing 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and amino acids (alanine/valine) abbreviated to KHL(1)/KHL(2) have been synthesized. All the metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. The Schiff bases KHL(1)/KHL(2) are found to act as tetradentate ligands using N(2)O(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around the metal ions. The binding behaviors of the complexes to calf thymus DNA have been investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. The DNA binding constants reveal that all these complexes interact with DNA through minor groove binding mode. The studies on mechanism of photocleavage reveal that singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) may play an important role in the photocleavage. The Schiff bases and their metal complexes have been screened for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, Fusarium solani, Culvularia lunata, Rhizoctonia bataicola and Candida albicans by MIC method.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of dextran-capped silver nanoparticles with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  - Dextran-capped silver nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing silver nitrate with NaBH4 in the presence of dextran as capping agent. The characters of silver nanoparticles were investigated using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, nano-grainsize analyzer, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Results showed that the silver nanoparticles capped with dextran were in uniform shape and narrow size distribution. Moreover, compared with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped silver nanoparticles, the dextran-capped ones possessed better stability. Antibacterial tests of these silver nanoparticles were carried out for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results suggested that the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles had high antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the cytotoxicity in vitro of the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles was investigated using mouse fibrosarcoma cells (L929). The toxicity was evaluated by the changes of cell morphology and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Results indicated that these silver nanoparticles had slight effect on the survival and proliferation of L-929 cells at their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). After modified by dextran, the physiochemical properties of the silver nanoparticles had been improved. We anticipated that these dextran-capped silver nanoparticles could be integrated into systems for biological and pharmaceutical applications.
TI  - A broad-range method to detect genomic DNA of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  - It remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. This work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16S rDNA region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (GNRs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property. In the quantitative detection of artificial sequence, the limit of detection (LOD) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pM level. This pair of universal GNRs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (PCs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. Moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing Serratia marcescens-spiked PCs. Therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective DNA analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in PCs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.
TI  - Synthesis of short cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics containing arginine analogues.
AB  - Worldwide efforts are underway to develop new antimicrobial agents against bacterial resistance. To identify new compounds with a good antimicrobial profile, we designed and synthesized two series of small cationic antimicrobial peptidomimetics (1-8) containing unusual arginine mimetics (to introduce cationic charges) and several aromatic amino acids (bulky moieties to improve lipophilicity). Both series were screened for in vitro antibacterial activity against a representative panel of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial strains, and Candida albicans. The biological screening showed that peptidomimetics containing tryptophan residues are endowed with the best antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis in respect to the other synthesized derivatives (MIC values range 7.5-50 microg/ml). Moreover, small antimicrobial peptidomimetics derivatives 2 and 5 showed an appreciable activity against the tested Gram-negative bacteria and C. albicans. The most active compounds (1-2 and 5-6) have been tested against Gram-positive established biofilm, too. Results showed that the biofilm inhibitory concentration values of these compounds were never up to 200 microg/ml. The replacement of tryptophan with phenylalanine or tyrosine resulted in considerable loss of the antibacterial action (compounds 3-4 and 7-8) against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Furthermore, by evaluating hemolytic activity, the synthesized compounds did not reveal cytotoxic activities, except for compound 5.
TI  - Evaluation of silicon oil on bacterial growth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of silicon oil (Oleo de Silicone(R), Ophthalmos, Brazil) on in vitro bacterial growth of different microorganisms related to endophthalmitis. METHODS: The following microorganisms were analyzed: (1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27583); (2) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); (3) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); (4) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228); (5) Candida albicans (ATCC 10231); (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883); and (7) Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 masculineC and its growth examined after 24 hours. An empty disk was placed in the center of each plate as a control. RESULTS: No inhibition halos were verified in any of the plates containing the four different concentrations of the bacterial inocula. CONCLUSIONS: The silicon oil 1000 cps does not have any effect on bacterial growth of any of the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of Rubus parvifolius L.
AB  - Rubus parvifolius L. (Rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. In this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of Rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. A uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded 0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of Rp leaves. We found that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Bacillus cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated Rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). Our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in Rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Infections from CVC in the pediatric neoplastic patient. Single institution experience.
AB  - AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of Aerva javanica and Paeonia emodi plants.
AB  - Aerva javanica and Paeonia emodi plants extracts were studied for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis (NCTC 11047) and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) (NCTC 13143) and antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani. Extracts were obtained by using methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fraction. The extracts of Paeonia emodi and Aerva javanica showed significant antibacterial activity but only Salmonella typhi was resistant to Aerva javanica. Moreover, the antifungal activity of Aerva javanica was very poor but the fractions of Paeonia emodi showed sufficient inhibition against fungal strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2010].
AB  - We investigated antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against 164 isolates (41 Escherichia coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 18 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 47 Staphylococcus epidermidis) from blood of the patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January and October in 2010. Meropenem showed the potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially and it maintained good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including resistant strains through 13 years since when we started the investigation. These results indicated the validity of choosing meropenem as a first line antimicrobial agent for serious infectious diseases.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  - Flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. In this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-derived platelet concentrates (PCs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. Five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were used. Platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) CFUs per mL; 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, and 2.0 mL aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. During the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. We could detect a low concentration (10 CFUs per mL) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 mL) of PCs. Irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of B. cereus, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli were 16 hours or less. A higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. The numbers of detected bacteria increased during the incubation. However, the graphs corresponding to K. pneumoniae and E. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. The incubation of small volumes of PC with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. Therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using PRP-derived PCs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Bacterial flora concurrent with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach of patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the non-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial flora concurrent with H. pylori infection. METHODS: A total of 103 gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori positive patients were selected for bacterial culture. All the non-H. pylori bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: A total of 201 non-H. pylori bacterial isolates were cultivated from 67 (65.0%) of the 103 gastric samples, including 153 isolates identified successfully at species level and 48 at genus level by MALDI-TOF MS. The dominant species were Streptococcus, Neisseria, Rothia and Staphylococcus, which differed from the predominantly acid resistant species reported previously in healthy volunteers. The prevalence of non-H. pylori bacteria was higher in non-ulcer dyspepsia group than in gastric ulcer group (100% vs 42.9%, P < 0.001). Six bacterial species with urease activity (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Brevibacterium spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of the non-H. pylori bacteria concurrent with H. pylori infection, and the non-H. pylori bacteria may also play important as-yet-undiscovered roles in the pathogenesis of stomach disorders.
TI  - Propolis standardized extract (EPP-AF(R)), an innovative chemically and biologically reproducible pharmaceutical compound for treating wounds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a formulation, containing the propolis standardized extract (EPP-AF((R))), which can assist in the healing of skin lesions. To achieve this objective the antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the propolis extract was determined. The final product was subjected to in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical evaluation. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the extracts and formulations against the microorganisms most commonly found in burns, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wistar rats with puncture wounded skin were used to evaluate the wound healing properties of propolis. The results of chemical and biological characterization demonstrated the batch-to-batch reproducibility of the standardized extract which is an unprecedented result. The antimicrobial and wound healing activity of the pharmaceutical studied showed the best results when samples contain 3.6% propolis, suggesting that this is the most promising composition.
TI  - Studies on DNA binding behaviour of biologically active transition metal complexes of new tetradentate N2O2 donor Schiff bases: inhibitory activity against bacteria.
AB  - A series of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of the type ML have been synthesized with Schiff bases derived from o-acetoacetotoluidide, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine/1,4-diaminobutane. The complexes are insoluble in common organic solvents but soluble in DMF and DMSO. The measured molar conductance values in DMSO indicate that the complexes are non-electrolytic in nature. All the six metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. The analytical data helped to elucidate the structure of the metal complexes. The Schiff bases are found to act as tetradentate ligands using N(2)O(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around all the metal ions. The binding properties of metal complexes with DNA were investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Detailed analysis reveals that the metal complexes intercalate into the DNA base stack as intercalators. All the metal complexes cleave the pUC19 DNA in presence of H(2)O(2.) The Schiff bases and their complexes have been screened for their antibacterial activity against five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) by disk diffusion method. All the metal complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.
TI  - Determination of antimicrobial activity and resistance to oxidation of moringa peregrina seed oil.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the oil extracted with n-hexane from the seeds of Moringa peregrina was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. The oil proved effective against all of the tested microorganisms. Standard antibiotics (netilmycin, 5-flucytocine, intraconazole and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid) were used for comparison. The resistance to oxidation of the extracted seed oil was also determined.
TI  - Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections in the intensive care unit.
AB  - CONTEXT: Central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. AIMS: This study was conducted to determine the incidence of central venous catheter-related infections (CRIs) and to identify the factors influencing it. So far, there are very few studies that have been conducted on CRBSI in the intensive care unit in India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a prospective, observational study carried out in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) over a period of 1 year from January to December 2004. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 54 patients with indwelling central venous catheters of age group between 20 and 75 years were included. The catheters were cultured using the standard semiquantitative culture (SQC) method. Statistical analysis used SPSS-10 version statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 54 CVC catheters with 319 catheter days were included in this study. Of 54 patients with CVCs studied for bacteriology, 39 (72.22%) catheters showed negative SQCs and also negative blood cultures. A total of 15 (27.77%) catheters were positive on SQC, of which 10 (18.52%) were with catheter-associated infection and four (7.41%) were with catheter-associated bacteremia; the remaining one was a probable catheter-associated bacteremia. CRIs were high among catheters that were kept in situ for more than 3 days and emergency procedures where two or more attempts were required for catheterization (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis of covariance duration of catheter in situ for >3 days, inexperienced venupucturist, more number of attempts and emergency CVC were associated with more incidence of CVCBSIs, with P <0.02. The duration of catheter in situ was negatively correlated (-0.53) and number of attempts required to put CVC was positively correlated (+0.39) with incidence of CVCBSIs. Sixty-five percent of the isolates belonged to the CONS group (13/20). Staphylococcus epidermidis showed maximum susceptibility to amikacin, doxycycline and amoxycillin with clavulanic acid and was susceptible to vancomycin (100%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100% susceptible to amikacin and ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli was susceptible to amikacin and cefotaxime. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of CRI was 27.77% (15/54). Catheter-associated BSIs were 47.31 per 1000 catheter-days. CRI was low in the catheters inserted by the experienced venipuncturists, elective procedure and CVC kept in situ for </=3 days. S. epidermidis was the most common isolate.
TI  - In vitro antioxidant, anticoagulant and antimicrobial activity and in inhibition  of cancer cell proliferation by xylan extracted from corn cobs.
AB  - Xylan is one of most abundant polymer after cellulose. However, its potential has yet to be completely recognized. Corn cobs contain a considerable reservoir of xylan. The aim of this work was to study some of the biological activities of xylan obtained from corn cobs after alkaline extraction enhanced by ultrasonication. Physical chemistry and infrared analyses showed 130 kDa heteroxylan containing mainly xylose:arabinose: galactose:glucose (5.0:1.5:2.0:1.2). Xylan obtained exhibited total antioxidant activity corresponding to 48.5 mg of ascorbic acid equivalent/g of xylan. Furthermore, xylan displayed high ferric chelating activity (70%) at 2 mg/mL. Xylan also showed anticoagulant activity in aPTT test. In antimicrobial assay, the polysaccharide significantly inhibited bacterial growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In a test with normal and tumor human cells, after 72 h, only HeLa tumor cell proliferation was inhibited (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner by xylan, reaching saturation at around 2 mg/mL, whereas 3T3 normal cell proliferation was not affected. The results suggest that it has potential clinical applications as antioxidant, anticoagulant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative compounds.
TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - Taurolidine lock solution in the secondary prevention of central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection in home parenteral nutrition patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection (CBSI) is a serious complication in patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). The aim was to analyze the impact of taurolidine-citrate lock solution (TLS) on CBSI rate in HPN patients with a high risk of catheter infection. METHODS: This retrospective study compared CBSI rates 12 months before and 12 months after implementation of TLS. In the first period, only standardized strategies were used to reduce the CBSI rate. In the second period, TLS was injected into the catheter at the end of parenteral nutrition. The CBSI rate with a confident interval was calculated as Poisson event rates, and compared by testing for homogeneity of rates. RESULTS: 15 patients were included. During the 24 months, the CBSI rate was 6.58/1000 catheter-days in the first period and 1.09/1000 catheter-days in the second period (p < 0.001). In patients with TLS once a week (n = 8), the CBSI rate decreased from 4.8/1000 catheter-days to 1.37/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.02) and in patients with TLS after each TPN (n = 7), the CBSI rate decreased from 8.61/1000 catheter-days to 0.78/1000 catheter-days (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In HPN patients, TLS associated with standardized precautions significantly reduced the CBSI rate.
TI  - Milk microbiome signatures of subclinical mastitis-affected cattle analysed by shotgun sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus x B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63.07, 11.09 and 7.87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.
TI  - Analysis of scalp wound infections among craniocerebral trauma patients following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - AIM: To explore the causes of scalp wound infection, pathogen distribution, characteristics of antimicrobial susceptibility and therapeutic measures following craniocerebral trauma caused by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. MATERIAL and METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the microbiology records of patients admitted with craniocerebral trauma to the Department of Neurosurgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Scalp wound infections following craniocerebral trauma were caused by the Wenchuan earthquake. RESULTS: A total of 82 patients suffered from scalp trauma in this study, including 52.4% cases (43/82) with wound infections, mostly accompanied by severe foreign body contamination, for which the time of first debridement was significantly delayed. There were 59 strains of infectious pathogenic bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria were the most common organisms found (64.4%), including strains of Staphylococcus aureus (26/59, 44.1%) and strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis (12/59, 20.3%). Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 35.6% of samples: 22.0% (13/59) were strains of Enterobacter cloacae; 5.1% (3/59) were strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae; and 8.5% (5/59) were strains of Serratia rubidaea. CONCLUSION: The rate of scalp wound infections following earthquake-induced craniocerebral trauma, which was dominated by Grampositive Staphylococcus aureus infection, has been markedly elevated in recent years. Early debridement and suturing, nutritional support and application of sensitive antibiotics can augment the therapeutic effect.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ulopterol isolated from Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.: a  traditional medicinal plant.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The leaves of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used in folk medicine in India to treat various ailments like cough, malaria, indigestion, influenza lung diseases and rheumatism, fever, stomach ailments, cholera and diarrhea. In our earlier communication we have reported the antimicrobial study on the various extracts of the leaves and the isolation and identification of Flindersine, a quinolone alkaloid as the major active principle. In the present study, we report the antibacterial and antifungal activities of Ulopterol, a coumarin isolated as another major active antimicrobial principle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The leaves were successively extracted with hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water. The extracts were studied for their antimicrobial activity against selected bacteria and fungi by using disc-diffusion method. The ethyl acetate extract which was found to possess highest antimicrobial activity was subjected to activity guided fractionation by column chromatography over silica gel. This resulted in the isolation of the coumarin, Ulopetrol, an active principle besides Flindersine which was reported by us earlier. The structure of the compound was elucidated using physical and spectroscopic data. Flindersine and Ulopterol were quantified by HPLC. RESULTS: Ulopterol showed activity against the bacteria viz. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-3967), Escherichia coli (ESBL-3984) and fungi viz. Aspergillus flavus, Candida krusei and Botrytis cinerea. Quantification by HPLC showed the content of Flindersine and Ulopterol to be 0.361% and 0.266% respectively on dry weight basis of the leaves. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract (successive extraction) contained Ulopterol, a coumarin, besides Flindersine, a quinolone alkaloid, as a major active principle in the antimicrobial studies. This is the first report of the antimicrobial activity of Ulopterol and also its first report from the plant.
TI  - Antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of Hypericum scabrum.
AB  - The hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of Hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern Iran, were obtained by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. The hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. The other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid (7.4%). The stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. The hexane extracts of different parts from H. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several Hypericum species. The antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of H. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. The highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an IC50 = 165 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger). The bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. This study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of some Indian Ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. Herbal preparations such as Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna, Manjistadi churna, Sukhsarak churna, Ajmodadi churna, Shivkshar pachan churna, Mahasudarshan churna, Swadist Virechan churna and Pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris, respectively. In the present study, Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against S. epidermidis, P. vulgaris, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhi. The study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
TI  - Inter-laboratory comparison of different rapid methods for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates still represents a major risk in transfusion medicine, and a variety of screening methods have been available to improve the safety of PCs. In the present study, the analytical quality of three different rapid screening methods (BactiFlow flow cytometry, Pan Genera Detection Assay, 23S rRNA RT-PCR) was evaluated in an inter-laboratory comparison in three different German blood services. METHODS: Samples were inoculated with different bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli (two strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (one strain), Serratia marcescens (one strain)] at different counts (4.5 x 10(3) -4.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml) alternating with negative samples in one transfusion facility. Samples were blinded with a random order for each screening method, shipped to partners and analysed immediately after receipt with different rapid screening methods. RESULTS: The inter-laboratory comparison revealed that the BactiFlow assay and 23S rRNA RT-PCR-screening detected all samples correctly (positive: 12/12, negative: 8/8). The Pan Genera Detection Assay test detected only four of the positive samples. Four of the non-detected positive samples were below the assay's detection limit. Another four inoculated samples with comparatively high bacteria counts were detected false negative (E. coli (two strains): 9.87 x 10(5) and 2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively, K. pneumoniae: 4.79 x 10(6) CFU/ml, S. aureus: 6.03 x 10(5) CFU/ml). All rapid screening methods revealed no false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Both BactiFlow and 23S rRNA RT-PCR demonstrated a high sensitivity to detecting bacterial contamination in PCs. The Pan Genera Detection Assay had some shortcomings regarding sensitivity, especially for the detection of Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. The purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. Nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. The most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. The most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and Streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). The insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. Every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. Chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. In case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
TI  - Role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. METHODS: We performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of NAC. We also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with NAC or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and FITC-labeled concanavalin A. We measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and C. krusei. RESULTS: NAC 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9% reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of NAC ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. Biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in NAC-treated biofilms for all organisms except VRE. The number of non-viable cells in NAC-treated Gram-positive biofilms was increased (p<0.05 for MRSA and VRE). NAC-treated Gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. Fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: NAC is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. NAC has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Exploring the DNA binding mode of transition metal based biologically active compounds.
AB  - Few novel 4-aminoantipyrine derived Schiff bases and their metal complexes were synthesized and characterized. Their structural features and other properties were deduced from the elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility and molar conductivity as well as from mass, IR, UV-vis, (1)H NMR and EPR spectral studies. The binding of the complexes with CT-DNA was analyzed by electronic absorption spectroscopy, viscosity measurement, and cyclic voltammetry. The interaction of the metal complexes with DNA was also studied by molecular modeling with special reference to docking. The experimental and docking results revealed that the complexes have the ability of interaction with DNA of minor groove binding mode. The intrinsic binding constants (K(b)) of the complexes with CT-DNA were found out which show that they are minor groove binders. Gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated the ability of the complexes to cleave the pUC19 DNA in the presence of AH(2) (ascorbic acid). Moreover, the oxidative cleavage studies using distamycin revealed the minor groove binding for the newly synthesized 4-aminoantipyrine derived Schiff bases and their metal complexes. Evaluation of antibacterial activity of the complexes against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited that the complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Anthemis  altissima L. var. altissima.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the flowering parts of Anthemis altissima L. var. altissima was analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. In this study, 34 compounds representing 98.76% of the essential oil were identified. The main components were alpha-terpineol (26.42%), beta-pinene (9.23%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (6.30%), globulol (5.36%), n-tricosane (4.41%), terpinen-4-ol (4.08%) and 1,8 cineole (3.84%). Antibacterial activities of the essential oil and its two major components (alpha-terpineol and beta-pinene) were determined using microdilution method against both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. The essential oil showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (MICs ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 microL mL(-1)). It was found that alpha-terpineol with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the range 0.87-1.56 microL mL(-1) was a more potent antibacterial agent than beta-pinene with MIC values of the range 1.56-6.25 microL mL(-1). All of them, the essential oil, beta-pinene and alpha-terpineol, were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative ones.
TI  - Bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via PTBD.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. METHODS: A total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period July 2003 to September 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. Among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). RESULTS: A total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). Further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174 of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. No anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. The most common microorganisms were Enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), Escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), Enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and Enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). The percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). The percentage of enzyme-producing Escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). CONCLUSION: The bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the Tokyo Guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. Thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.
TI  - Rising incidence of acute prostatitis following prostate biopsy: fluoroquinolone  resistance and exposure is a significant risk factor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and potential risk factors for infection-related complications after transrectal prostate biopsy and to propose adjustments in current antimicrobial prophylaxis recommendations. METHODS: During 2008-2010, 107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate at our institution. Charts were reviewed for infection-related complications within 30 days of the procedure. Potential risk factors were evaluated, including age, diabetes mellitus, chronic constipation/diverticular disease, prior use of quinolones, enema and prostatitis, on the pathology report. For patients with acute prostatitis, urine and blood samples were assessed for bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: Of our 107 patients, acute prostatitis developed in 10 (9.3%). The most significant risk factor was prior use of a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial, with acute prostatitis developing in 7 (17.1%) of 41 patients who had used a fluoroquinolone compared with 3 (4.5%) of 66 patients who had not (P=.042). Patients who received an enema before the procedure were slightly less likely to develop prostatitis (P=.061). Of 8 positive specimens, the organisms isolated were Escherichia coli in 6, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one. Isolated Gram-negative organisms were fluoroquinolone-resistant in 85.7% of samples. CONCLUSION: Prior fluoroquinolone intake is a significant risk factor behind a rising incidence of acute prostatitis after transrectal prostate biopsy. Identified pathogens are mostly Gram-negative organisms with a high rate of fluoroquinolone resistance. Alternative prophylaxis regimens for the biopsy procedure should be considered in patients with recent quinolone intake.
TI  - Detection of volatile compounds produced by microbial growth in urine by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).
AB  - Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry has been used to measure the volatile compounds occurring in the headspace of urine samples inoculated with common urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing microbes Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans. This technique has the potential to offer rapid and simple diagnosis of the causative agent of UTIs.
TI  - Establishment of the first international repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains: ISBT working party transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (WP-TTID), subgroup on bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still remains  a significant problem in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. The International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases, Subgroup on Bacteria, organised an international study on Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria References to be used as a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four Bacteria References (Staphylococcus epidermidis PEI-B-06, Streptococcus pyogenes PEI-B-20, Klebsiella pneumoniae PEI-B-08 and Escherichia coli PEI-B-19) were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in PCs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in PCs after low spiking (0.3 and 0.03 CFU/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. RESULTS: Bacteria References were correctly identified in 98% of all 52 identifications. S. pyogenes and E. coli grew in PCs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. The results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95% confidence intervals were for S. epidermidis: 1.19-1.32 x 10(7) CFU/ml, S. pyogenes: 0.58-0.69 x 10(7) CFU/ml, K. pneumoniae: 18.71-20.26 x 10(7) CFU/ml and E. coli: 1.78-2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: The study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in PCs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. These aims were successfully fulfilled. The WHO Expert Committee Biological Standardisation has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first Repository for Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria Reference Strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repository.
TI  - Perfusion fluid contamination in relation to recipient survival and acute cellular rejection in orthotopic liver transplantation: retrospective analysis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A perfusion fluid used in the preservation of a grafted liver represents a medium suitable for microorganism growth. This study investigated the prevalence of perfusion fluid contamination, acute cellular rejection (ACR) episodes, and patient survival rate. METHOD: This is a retrospective study, based on an electronic database allocating cases of orthotopic liver transplantation. The exclusion criteria were as follows: having been submitted to multiple organ transplantation, liver retransplantation only, and those whose samples had not been collected or sent on the back table procedure or were unobtainable (usually the samples were sent when there was donor infection suspicion/positivity). Our posttransplantation infection prophylactic protocol consisted of ampicillin/sulbactam for 72 hours. The variables in the study were as follows: fluid contamination, presence of acute cellular rejection (ACR, Banff classification), and recipient survival at the first year. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and chi-square with Fisher exact test considering significant P<.05. RESULTS: We observed perfusion fluid contamination in 15/121 (12.39%). The agents were as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae in 6 (4.96%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 5 (4.13%), and Acinetobacter baumanii in 3 (2.48%) and negative cultures in 106 (87.60%). Only 1 patient had matching for donor infection and positivity hemoculture after the transplantation (K pneumoniae) and he was the only patient associated with fluid infection and death. The recipients who had their fluid preservation with positive cultures had more ACR and the survival rate was similar among those with or without infection. CONCLUSION: Optimization of microbiological procedures can be performed including fungal and bacterial cultures.
TI  - Broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by Kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  - Cell-free extracts prepared from Kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and K. kingae. The extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. Chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the K. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. Structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides. One was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-GlcNAcp-(1-->5)-beta-d-OclAp-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. The second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated PAM galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->. Purified PAM galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. A cluster of three K. kingae genes encoding UDP-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of PAM galactan in Escherichia coli. PAM galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. The biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.
TI  - Antagonistic bacteria from live corals, Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India.
AB  - The objective of this study is to isolate and production of secondary metabolites with bioactive substances by coral reef (Acropora formosa and Favia palida) associated bacteria was carried out from the Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India. The isolated coral associated bacteria were found to have an antagonistic effect against 10 human pathogens. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aerogenosa, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. faecalis and Bacillus cereus. It was observed that, out of the total 689 bacterial strains isolated, 10 and 13% of isolates from A. formosa and Favia palida, respectively were found to have antagonistic activity against the pathogens, A higher percentage of antagonistic strains were conferred from Favia palida with 13%. It was observed that all antagonistic strains were able to inhibit at least two of the human pathogens.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit  of Fatmawati Hospital, Indonesia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity pattern of bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care of Fatmawati Hospital Jakarta Indonesia. METHODS: A cross sectional retrospective study of bacterial pathogen was carried out on a total of 722 patients that were admitted to the ICU of Fatmawati Hospital Jakarta Indonesia during January 2009 to March 2010. All bacteria were identified by standard microbiologic methods, and their antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Specimens were collected from 385 patients who were given antimicrobial treatment, of which 249 (64.68%) were cultured positive and 136 (35.32%) were negative. The most predominant isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (26.5%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (15.3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (14.9%). P. aeruginosa isolates showed high rate of resistance to cephalexin (95.3%), cefotaxime (64.1%), and ceftriaxone (60.9%). Amikacin was the most effective (84.4%) antibiotic against P. aeruginosa followed by imipenem (81.2%), and meropenem (75.0%). K. pneumoniae showed resistance to cephalexin (86.5%), ceftriaxone (75.7%), ceftazidime (73.0%), cefpirome (73.0%) and cefotaxime (67.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria isolated from ICU of Fatmawati Hospital Jakarta Indonesia were resistant to the third generation of cephalosporins, and quinolone antibiotics. Regular surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility patterns is very important for setting orders to guide the clinician in choosing empirical or directed therapy of infected patients.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.
TI  - Left ventricular assist device vegetation: "cure" without device explantation.
AB  - Infection following the implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a life-threatening complication with mortality rates ranging from 15% to 44%. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most frequently identified pathogens and are responsible for 60% of LVAD-related infections, local as well as systemic. In this report we describe the successful therapeutic management of a patient who received a Heart Mate II as "bridging-to-recovery", which was complicated by device infection that was managed without device explantation.
TI  - Antibacterial action of a heat-stable form of L-amino acid oxidase isolated from  king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom.
AB  - The major l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO, EC 1.4.3.2) of king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom is known to be an unusual form of snake venom LAAO as it possesses unique structural features and unusual thermal stability. The antibacterial effects of king cobra venom LAAO were tested against several strains of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. For comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. King cobra venom LAAO was very effective in inhibiting the two Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78mug/mL (0.006muM) and 1.56mug/mL (0.012muM) against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively. The MICs are comparable to the MICs of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. However, the LAAO was only moderately effective against three Gram-negative bacteria tested (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli), with MIC ranges from 25 to 50mug/mL (0.2-0.4muM). Catalase at the concentration of 1mg/mL abolished the antibacterial effect of LAAO, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. Binding studies indicated that king cobra venom LAAO binds strongly to the Gram-positive S. aureus and S. epidermidis, but less strongly to the Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolone derivatives containing 3-(N'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino) pyrrolidines.
AB  - A series of novel 7-[3-(N'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl] fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity. Most of them exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC: 0.06-4.00 mug/mL). The activity of compounds 33 and 43 against S. aureus including MRSA and S. epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.06-0.125 mug/mL) is more than or comparable to the reference drugs levofloxacin and gemifloxacin. In addition, compound 33 is 32 and 16-32 fold more potent than both the reference drugs against Enterococcus faecium 08-7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 09-22, respectively.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: Seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. RESULTS: Of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. Among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). The most common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. To the gram-negative organisms, the most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. CONCLUSIONS: The most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to Meropenem, Imipenem and Amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium identified.
TI  - [Changes of pathogens for nosocomial infection of patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - In order to investigate the distribution of nosocomial infection in patients with hematological diseases in our hospital, and to explore the changes of the pathogens isolated. The method of retrospective investigation and analysis was employed. 1164 strain pathogens were isolated from the patients with hematological diseases during the period of 1997-2009. The results showed that the Gram-positive cocci infection increased gradually during the 13 years, but has been stable in the last 4 years. The Gram-negative bacteria showed a trend decrease. The fungi increased during these years. The rates of infection with gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacteria and fungus were 28.2%, 59.8% and 12.0% respectively. For the details, Escherichia coli infection rate was the highest: 12.1%, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.1%), Enterobacter (8.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.3%) and Enterococci (6.6%). The distribution of G(+)- and G(-) pathogens showed obvious change on end of 1990's and beginning of this century, but it was tending towards stability on recent years; the incidence of fungus was tending towards increase, which was related to wide application of strong broad-spectrum antibiotics. In conclusion, the patients with hematological diseases, as the high-risk group of nosocomial infection, should be monitored strictly. Infection is related to many factors, and the main factor is dysfunction of autoimmunity. The strategies should be explored to strengthen the immune protection and set up a reasonable scheme of antibiotics.
TI  - Antibiotic producing potentials of three freshwater actinomycetes isolated from the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.
AB  - Crude extracts of three actinomycetes species belonging to Saccharopolyspora (TR  046 and TR 039) and Actinosynnema (TR 024) genera were screened for antibacterial activities against a panel of several bacterial strains. The extracts showed antibacterial activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive test bacteria with inhibition zones ranging from 8 to 28 mm (TR 046); 8 to15 mm (TR 039); and 10 to 13 mm (TR 024). The minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.078 to 10 mg/mL (TR 046); 5 to >10 mg/mL (TR 039); and 1.25 to 5 mg/mL (TR 024). Time-kill studies revealed that crude extract of TR 046 showed strong bactericidal activity against Bacillus pumilus (ATCC14884), reducing the bacterial load by 10(4) cfu/mL and 10(2) cfu/mL at 4x MIC and 2x MIC, respectively, after 6 h of exposure. Similarly, against Proteus vulgaris (CSIR 0030), crude extract of TR 046 achieved a 0.9log(10) and 0.13log(10) cfu/mL reduction at 5 mg/mL (4x MIC) and 1.25 mg/mL (2x MIC) after 12 h of exposure. The extract was however weakly bactericidal against two environmental bacterial strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis); and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 19582): the extract showed bacteriostatic activities at all concentrations tested. These freshwater actinomycetes appear to have immense potential as a source of new antibacterial compound(s).
TI  - Influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between September 2006 and August 2008. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. The mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range, 1-134 days). The median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). A total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). The three most common Gram-negative bacilli were Serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. Notably, glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli other than Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. Of the Gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The two most common Gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was significantly related to Gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of novel fluoroquinolone derivatives containing substituted piperidines.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-aminomethyl-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated and correlated with their physicochemical properties. Results reveal that all of the target compounds have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.125-4 microg/mL). Compounds 12, 13 are more potent than or comparable to levofloxacin against MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella sonnei. Compound 17 is more active than or comparable to levofloxacin against S. aureus including MRSA, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy by liposome-encapsulated water-soluble photosensitizers.
AB  - Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is an alternative method for killing bacterial cells in view of the increasing problem of multi-antibiotic resistance. We examined the effect of three water-soluble photosensitizers (PhS): methylene blue (MB), neutral red (NR) and rose bengal (RB) on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We compared the efficacy of PhS in their free form and encapsulated in liposomal formulations against various bacterial strains, and determined conditions for the effective use of encapsulated PhS. We found that all three PhS were able to eradicate the Gram-positive microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Sarcina lutea; and MB and RB were effective against St. epidermidis. In the case of the Gram-negative species, MB and RB were cytotoxic against the Shigella flexneri, NR-inactivated Escherichia coli and Salmonella para B, and BR was effective in killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of the examined PhS showed activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. MB and NR enclosed in liposomes gave a stronger antimicrobial effect than free PhS for all tested prokaryotes, whereas encapsulation of RB led to no increase in its activity. We suggest that encapsulation of PhS can increase the photoinactivation of bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - [The role of microflora in etiology of chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Analysis of the results of a bacteriological study involving 218 patients with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (CT) has demonstrated that they were significantly different in terms of the seeding rate of beta-hemolytic group A Streptococci (BHAS). Specifically, these microorganisms were detected in patients with paratonsillar abscess 2.5 times as frequently as in those with uncomplicated forms of chronic tonsilitis. In other words, the former group is at risk of developing such concomitant diseases as post-streptococcal rheumocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis. It was shown that BHAS are capable of forming a biological film at the surface of abiogenic carriers in vitro which may be a principal cause of chronic and recurring tonsillitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2008].
AB  - We examined the antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against main bacteria isolated from patient blood in Keio university hospital between January and November in 2008. A total of 187 isolates, including 43 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 50 Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested. Meropenem showed the potent and stable antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially compared with our previous testing data. These results suggested that meropenem was first-line antibiotic for serious infections, although over 12 years passed after meropenem was approved in Japan.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of schiff bases of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-morpholines.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Potential airborne microbial hazards for workers on dairy and beef cattle farms in Egypt.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the concentration and frequency distribution of certain airborne micro-organisms on cattle farms and their potential health hazards to farm workers. The samples (60 air samples and 240 hand and nasal swabs from cattle farm workers) were collected from ten cattle farms (five dairy barns and five beef sheds) located in the Sharkia Governorate of Egypt. Air samples were collected for microbiological examination in liquid media using an all-glass impinger whereas those for fungal examination were placed on agar plates using slit air samplers (aeroscopes). The results showed that the overall means of total culturable bacterial and fungal counts were lower in the air of dairy cattle barns than in beef cattle sheds. Identification of the isolated bacteria revealed the recovery of the following species (from dairy cattle barns versus beef cattle sheds): Staphylococcus epidermidis (26.7% vs 36.7%), S. saprophyticus (20% vs 33.3%), S. aureus (10% vs 16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (23.3% vs 26.7%), Enterobacter agglomerans (23.3 vs 13.3%), Escherichia coli, (16.7% vs 26.7%), Klebsiella oxytoca, (10% vs 16.7%), K. pneumoniae (3.3% vs 0%), Proteus rettegri (6.7% vs 13.3%), P. mirabilis (10% vs 10%), P. vulgaris (3.3% vs 6.7%), Pseudomonas species (6.7% vs 16.7%), respectively). Mycological examination of air samples revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus (46.7% vs 63.3%), A. niger (20% vs 36.7%), A. flavus (13.3% vs 26.7%), Penicillium citrinum (16.7% vs 23.3%), P. viridicatum (13.3% vs 6.7%), P. capsulatum (3.3% vs 0%), Cladosporium spp. (30% vs 56.7%), Alternaria spp. (13.3 vs 23.3%), Mucor spp. (6.7% vs 16.7%), Fusarium spp. (3.3% vs 10%), Absidia spp. (6.7% vs 10%), Curvilaria spp. (10% vs 3.3%), Rhizopus spp. (6.7% vs 13.3%), Scopulariopsis (3.3% vs 6.7%), Epicoccum spp. (0% vs 3.4%) and yeast (13.3% vs 20%), respectively. In addition, microbiological examinations of farm workers revealed heavy contamination of their hands and noses with most of the micro-organisms detected in the air of cattle farms. The results showed that potential airborne microbial risks in beef cattle sheds were greater than in dairies.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Pathogen incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in children.
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in children with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in order to optimize empirical antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis. from 2001 to 2006, 895 children with an indwelling catheter from 3 hospitals in China were included in this study, of whom 335 (37.4%) had CAUTI. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 450 bacterial isolates was performed using the ClSi broth and Kirby-bauer agar dilution methods. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus spp. E. coli had higher susceptibility to ceftazidime (87.4%), cefuroxime (85.1%) and cefatrizine (76.6%) than to sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (8.0%), amoxicillin (21.7%), ampicillin (17.1%) and cefazolin (37.7%). Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus species had similar patterns as E. coli. S. aureus had lower susceptibility to SmZ (6.8%), ampicillin (8.2%), and amoxicillin (24.7%); the trend of S. epidermidis was similar. This study demonstrates that the Gram-negative species are the predominating uropathogens of CAUti in children. it is important to know the bacterial spectrum and the susceptibility patterns to various classes of antibiotic agents to improve empiric antibiotic therapy of children with CAUTI in China.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy assessment of multi-use solution to disinfect hydrophilic  contact lens, in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of disinfecting solutions in hydrophilic contact lenses (CL). METHODS: Two multi-use solutions denominated solution A (0.001% polyquaternium-1 and 0.0005% myristamidopropyl dimethylamine) and solution B (0.0001% polyaminopropyl biguanide) were used. The solutions were tested in hydrophilic contact lenses infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27583), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC1226), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC13883), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) and the decrease in microorganisms growth after the hydrophilic contact lenses were cleaned with the respective solutions was verified. The manufacture's instructions were followed. RESULTS: A decrease of 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and a decrease 100% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was observed. CONCLUSION: The solutions decreased the amount of microorganisms tested.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. Several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. There is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored PLT concentrates (PCs). Nine synthetic AMPs, four from PLT microbicidal protein-derived peptides (PD1-4) and five Arg-Trp (RW) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and PC samples spiked with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus cereus. A 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. RESULTS: In both plasma alone and PCs, RW3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae; PD4 and RW2 against P. aeruginosa; and RW4 against K. pneumoniae. The activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic AMPs against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, PCs, and other blood products.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro assessment of the antibiotic efficacy of contrast media and antibiotics  and their combinations at various dilutions.
AB  - Discography is a controversial diagnostic procedure involving the injection of radiographic contrast medium (RCM) into the intervertebral disc. Iatrogenic bacterial discitis is a rare but serious complication. The intervention has been increasingly performed in our patients here in the United Arab Emirates. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic administration can reduce post-interventional discitis; however, this may favour the development of bacterial resistance. Direct intradiscal injection of an antibiotic together with the RCM is a potential alternative. To date, there has been only one study on the efficacy of antibiotics added to an RCM. Equally, there are only limited data regarding the potential direct effect of RCM on bacterial growth. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of antibiotics is affected when RCM are added. In an in vitro study, the effect of non-ionic RCM on the growth of five laboratory bacterial strains, alone and in combination with three broad-spectrum antimicrobials, was tested. Bacterial growth was assessed in the absence and the presence of RCM, antibiotics and their combinations. All three RCM alone demonstrated some inhibition of bacterial growth at high concentrations. In the presence of the RCM, all three antibiotics retained their inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. In conclusion, our in vitro experiments did not reveal any changes in the antimicrobial efficacy of the three antibiotics in the presence of the three tested RCM. Subsequent clinical trials will need to assess whether intradiscal antibiotic administration may be a suitable substitute for, or a supplement to, prophylactic systemic antibiotics before discography.
TI  - Identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood cultures: comparison between conventional and PCR methods.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in a survey in a medical center. A PCR method for identification of these five most common pathogens in blood cultures was developed. A unique sequence was chosen for each pathogen and used for primer design. Sixty-one blood samples (from hospitalized patients) in which bacterial growth was detected were processed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods and by the PCR method. The results obtained by PCR were identical to those obtained by conventional methods in 93.4% of the cases. PCR failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 6.6% of the cases (mostly bacteria not included in the PCR cassette). Another group of eighty-eight blood samples from patients were processed immediately upon their arrival at the laboratory by taking aliquots for the PCR method. The blood sample bottles were processed in parallel by conventional methods. In 78.4% of the cases the results of both methods were identical. In 12.5% of the cases, PCR afforded identification of bacteria but conventional methods showed no bacteria in the sample. On the other hand, PCR afforded 9.1% negative results while conventional methods identified bacteria not included in the PCR cassette. It is concluded that the molecular method appears to be a specific and precise method for identifying pathogenic bacteria in blood samples.
TI  - [Etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake. METHODS: 2135 smears of secretion were made from 1823 hospitalized wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake to detect the pathogens. Specimens were delivered to be cultured. The bacteria thus obtained were identified. Drug sensitivity test was conducted. RESULTS: 2002 specimens, 1243 specimens of secretion (62.1%), 600 blood specimens (30.0%), 102 specimens of pus or secretion of respiratory tract (5.1%), 45 specimens from catheter (2.2%), and 12 urine specimens (0.5%). Pathogens were found in 725 cases. The top five pathogenic bacteria isolated within 1 month after the quake were Acinetobacter baumannii (16.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (16.7%), Escherichia coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Candida tropicalis (8.3%), quite different from the pathogen spectrum of the common in-patients within one month before the quake: Escherichia coli (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%), Candida glabrata (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%). The isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus after the earthquake was significantly lower, and the isolation rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were all significantly higher than those from the common surgical patients before the quake (all P < 0.05). There were not significant differences in the isolation rates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Acinetobacter baumannii before and after the quake. CONCLUSION: Infection is frequent after natural disasters. It is necessary to summarize the changes of spectrum of pathogens and drug-resistant spectrum.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against MRSA and MRSE.
AB  - Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. This report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous Ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus. The bioreduction of the Ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Mutant prevention concentrations of antibacterial agents to ocular pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to measure mutant prevention concentration (MPC) in vitro, and to measure MPC of antibacterial agents for ocular bacteria caused keratitis. METHODS: It was an experimental study. Forty strains of ocular bacteria were separated from cornea in Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, which included 8 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the levofloxacin (LVF), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NFL), tobramycin (TOB) and chloromycetin (CHL) were determined by agar dilution method from National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS). The MPC were measured by accumulate-bacterial methods with bacterial population inoculated more than 1.2 x 10(10) colony forming units per milliliter with Mueller-Hinton broth and tryptic soy agar plate. With the software of SPSS 11.0, the datum such as the range of MIC, MPC, MIC90 and MPC90 were calculated, and the selection index (MPC90/ MI90) and mutant selection window (MSW) were obtained. RESULTS: The MI90 of LVF and TOB (4 mg/L) to Staphylococcus aureus strains were the lowest. CIP showed the lowest MIC90 (0.25 mg/L) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa among six kinds of antibacterial agents. The MIC90 of LVF to Staphylococcus epidermidis (256 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L) were lower than other antibacterial agents. The MPC90, MSW and the MPC90/MIC90 of levofloxacin showed lower values compared with other antibacterial medicines. From all the datum, the MIC90 of CHL was the highest and the activity was the weakest. Although the activity of LVF was higher to every kind of bacteria, CIP had the highest activity antibacterial to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The capacity of CHL and TOB was weaker than Quinolones for restricting resistant mutants on ocular bacteria. LVF had the strongest capacity for restricting resistant mutants among Quinolones. CONCLUSION: LVF has better antibacterial effects and stronger capacity for restricting the selection of resistant mutants on ocular bacteria than other antibacterial agents.
TI  - Screening of platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination: spectrum of bacteria detected, proportion of transfused units, and clinical follow-up.
AB  - Screening of platelet concentrates (PCs) for bacterial contamination with cultivation methods is carried out as a routine procedure in some countries. The aim is to prevent the transfusion of contaminated PCs. The German Evaluation of Regular Monitoring Study Group conducted a prospective multicenter study on 52,243 PCs to investigate the prevalence of bacteria (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux). This study describes the detected bacterial spectrum, the proportion of PCs with a positive test result that had been transfused, and the results of the clinical follow-up. One hundred thirteen (67%) of 169 potentially or confirmed positive units had already been transfused at the time of the first positive signal. The transfusion of units contaminated by Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and 73% of the units contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, or Staphylococcus saccharolyticus was prevented. In contrast, 85% of units with Propionibacterium acnes were transfused. A clonal relationship of the isolates from the pooled PCs and from the associated red blood cell concentrates was found in all investigated cases. The follow-up revealed six febrile reactions to culture-positive PCs not classified as transfusion reaction (TRs) by treating physicians. This demonstrates the importance of hemovigilance. Serious septic reactions due to Klebsiella pneumoniae in two units of one apheresis PC that had tested false-negative were reported; one had a fatal outcome. Culture systems reduce the risk of transfusion of contaminated PCs but cannot guarantee sterility. Physicians must be aware of bacterial contamination of PCs as a potential cause of TRs and must report all adverse events.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. All of the title compounds have considerable activity against the twelve strains, and exhibit exceptional potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.06-8 microg/mL). The most active compound 17 is 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, 32-fold more potent than levofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 16-fold more potent than IMB against K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the Indian scenario.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. The bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae) essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from the aerial parts of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-six compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were (E)-caryophyllene (27.0%), germacrene D (26.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus flavus ATCC 10240, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIMB 9111, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC24433). The essential oil showed activity against all the microorganisms tested, but differences in microbial susceptibility were registered.
TI  - [Candida-induced recurrent peritonitis after peritoneal catheter reinsertion].
AB  
TI  - Eradication of microorganisms embedded in biofilm by an ethanol-based catheter lock solution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interdialytic locking of catheters with antimicrobial agents is frequently used for preventing catheter-related infections, often associated with biofilm formation. We determined the bactericidal effect of 60% ethanol (ETOH) versus a 46.7% trisodium citrate (TSC) solution on biofilm embedded in silicone catheters. METHODS: Four- and 24-h biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans established in a microfermentor were exposed to ETOH and TSC for up to 24 h and the number of remaining viable microorganisms was determined. RESULTS: ETOH 60% was significantly more effective than 46.7% TSC in rapidly eradicating sessile cells from all microorganisms tested. A 20-min ETOH 60% treatment completely eradicated the Gram-negative bacilli and C. albicans biofilms, which initially contained up to 10(8) and 10(5) cells, respectively. Gram-positive cocci biofilms only showed a significant 2.6-4.3 log reduction in the initial viable counts after 20 min of ETOH 60% treatment, with eradication occurring after 30 min. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observation of ETOH-treated biofilm showed sparse cells with respiratory activity. TSC 46.7% eradicated none of the tested microorganisms. In contrast, ETOH 60% totally eradicated planktonic cells, whereas TSC had significant bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans after 20 min, 1 and 24 h, respectively, but none on the Staphylococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: This in vitro study demonstrates the superior antimicrobial activity of ETOH 60% in contrast to TSC 46.7% in eradicating biofilm formed on a silicon catheter. Hence, ethanol-based solution shows promise as a catheter lock solution.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and composition of essential oil from Tanacetum balsamita L. subsp. balsamita.
AB  - The aerial parts of Tanacetum balsamita subsp. balsamita were collected at full flowering stage from Tabriz, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Twenty seven components were identified, representing 99.2% of the total oil. Carvone (51.0%), beta-thujone (20.8%), 1,8-cineole (4.4%) and alpha-thujone (3.2%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of T. balsamita subsp. balsamita was studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity. The in vitro toxicological study based on the MTT cytotoxicity assay on human fetal skin fibroblast (HFSF) and Monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines showed IC50 values of 2500 and 1250 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a bioactive lantibiotic produced by Staphylococcus warneri.
AB  - Lantibiotics are a group of potent antibacterial agents that contain unusual amino acids, such as the thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, and the didehydroamino acids didehydroalanine and didehydro-aminobutyric acid. Here, we report on an antibacterial lantibiotic peptide named SWLP1 (Staphylococcus warneri lantibiotic peptide 1), which is secreted from Staphylococcus warneri (deposited with DSMZ, accession number DSM 16081). SWLP1 was purified from growth media. The purified peptide displays antibacterial activity against several species, including Staphylococcus epidermidis. The molecular mass of SWLP1 is 2998.9 Da as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The sequence and possible structure was elucidated by combining electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data of ethanethiol-treated and non-ethanethiol-treated tryptic fragments of the SWLP1. SWLP1 contains three thioether bridges, one didehydroalanine, and three didehydroaminobutyric acids. This peptide has the potential to be used in treatment of several Gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - Bacteria, biofilm and honey: a study of the effects of honey on 'planktonic' and  biofilm-embedded chronic wound bacteria.
AB  - Chronically infected wounds are a costly source of suffering. An important factor in the failure of a sore to heal is the presence of multiple species of bacteria, living cooperatively in highly organized biofilms. The biofilm protects the bacteria from antibiotic therapy and the patient's immune response. Honey has been used as a wound treatment for millennia. The components responsible for its antibacterial properties are now being elucidated. The study aimed to determine the effects of different concentrations of 'Medihoney' therapeutic honey and Norwegian Forest Honey 1) on the real-time growth of typical chronic wound bacteria; 2) on biofilm formation; and 3) on the same bacteria already embedded in biofilm. Reference strains of MRSE, MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with dilution series of the honeys in microtitre plates for 20 h. Growth of the bacteria was assessed by measuring optical density every 10 min. Growth curves, biofilm formation and minimum bactericidal concentrations are presented. Both honeys were bactericidal against all the strains of bacteria. Biofilm was penetrated by biocidal substances in honey. Reintroduction of honey as a conventional wound treatment may help improve individual wound care, prevent invasive infections, eliminate colonization, interrupt outbreaks and thereby preserve current antibiotic stocks.
TI  - Flexible microfluidic device for mechanical property characterization of soft viscoelastic solids such as bacterial biofilms.
AB  - We introduce a flexible microfluidic device to characterize the mechanical properties of soft viscoelastic solids such as bacterial biofilms. In the device, stress is imposed on a test specimen by the application of a fixed pressure to a thin, flexible poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) membrane that is in contact with the specimen. The stress is applied by pressurizing a microfabricated air channel located above the test area. The strain resulting from the applied stress is quantified by measuring the membrane deflection with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The deflection is governed by the viscoelastic properties of the PDMS membrane and of the test specimen. The relative contributions of the membrane and test material to the measured deformation are quantified by comparing a finite element analysis with an independent (control) measurement of the PDMS membrane mechanical properties. The flexible microfluidic rheometer was used to characterize both the steady-state elastic modulus and the transient strain recoil of two soft materials: gellan gums and bacterial biofilms. The measured linear elastic moduli and viscoelastic relaxation times of gellan gum solutions were in good agreement with the results of conventional mechanical rheometry. The linear Young's moduli of biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which could not be measured using conventional methods, were found to be 3.2 and 1.1 kPa, respectively, and the relaxation time of the S. epidermidis biofilm was 13.8 s. Additionally, strain hardening was observed in all the biofilms studied. Finally, design parameters and detection limits of the method show that the device is capable of characterizing soft viscoelastic solids with elastic moduli in the range of 102-105 Pa. The flexible microfluidic rheometer addresses the need for mechanical property characterization of soft viscoelastic solids common in fields such as biomaterials, food, and consumer products. It requires only 200 pL of the test specimen.
TI  - Antitumour and antimicrobial activities of endophytic streptomycetes from pharmaceutical plants in rainforest.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to screen antitumour and antimicrobial activities of endophytic actinomycetes isolated from pharmaceutical plants in rainforest in Yunnan province, China. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antitumour activity was studied by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and antimicrobial activity was determined by agar well diffusion method. The high bioactive endophytic isolates were identified and further investigated for the presence of polyketide synthases (PKS-I, PKS-II) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) sequences by specific amplification. The molecular identification confirmed that the 41 isolates showed significant activities were members of the genus Streptomyces. Among them, 31.7% of endophytic streptomycete cultures were cytotoxic against A549 cells, 29.3% against HL-60 cells, 85.4% against BEL-7404 cells, 90.2% against P388D1 cells, 65.9% were active against Escherichia coli, 24.4% against Staphylococcus aureus, 31.7% against Staphylococcus epidermidis, 12.2% against Candida albicans and no strain displayed antagonistic activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. High frequencies of positive PCR amplification were obtained for PKS-I (34.1%), PKS-II (63.4%) and NRPS (61.0%) biosynthetic systems. CONCLUSIONS: Many endophytic streptomycetes isolated from pharmaceutical plants in rainforest possess remarkable and diverse antitumour and antimicrobial bioactivities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These endophytic streptomycetes are precious resources obtained from rainforests, and they could be a promising source for bioactive agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some plant extracts used in folk medicine.
AB  - In the present work, selected plants were screened for their potential antibacterial activity. For evaluating antibacterial activity, both aqueous and organic solvent methanol was used. The plants screened were Ocimum sanctum, Jatropha gossypifolia, Boerhavia diffusa, Azadirachta indica, Solidago virgaurea, and Commelina benghalensis. The antibacterial activity was assessed against six bacterial strains--Pseudomonas testosteroni, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus morganii, Micrococcus flavus. Agar disc diffusion method and Agar ditch diffusion method were used to study the antibacterial activity of all these plants. Ps. testosteroni and K. pneumoniae were the most resistant bacterial strains. A. indica showed strong activity against tested bacterial strains. Therefore, we conclude that A. indica may prove to be a promising agent, and further exploration into this compound should be performed to determine its full therapeutic potential. In addition, its leaf extract can also be used as a lead molecule in combating the diseases caused by the studied bacterial strains.
TI  - Clinicobacteriological study of chronic dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - Chronic dacryocystitis is the inflammation of lacrimal sac, frequently caused by  bacteria. Obstruction of nasolacrimal duct converts the lacrimal sac a reservoir of infection. It is a constant threat to cornea and orbital soft tissue. Moreover, it causes social embarrassment due to chronic watering from the eye. This study was conducted to find out the current clinicobacteriological profile of chronic dacryocystitis in adults. A total of 56 adult patients were selected from ophthalmology OPD. Detail history and clinical examinations were carried out. All patients underwent either dacryocystorhinostomy or dacryocystectomy. A part of the sac was collected for culture and sensitivity. This study revealed that chronic dacryocystitis is more common in females and left eye is more frequently involved than right eye. It is common among lower socioeconomic strata with habit of pond-bathing. Some form of nasal pathology like hypertrophied inferior turbinate, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyp and allergic rhinitis werefound in 19.6% of the patients. Complications of chronic dacryocystitis like conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, acute on chronic dacryocystitis, lacrimal abscess and fistula were seen in 25.0% of these patients; 53.6% of the culture samples were positive for bacterial growth. Gram-positive organisms were most common isolate. Unlike other studies, Staphylococcus aureus (40.0%) was found to be most common Gram-positive organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.0%) and Steptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%). Among the Gram-negative organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%) was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6.6%). Antibiotic sensitivity tests were done. Most of the organisms were resistant to penicillin. Chloramphenicol was effective against most of the Gram-positive organisms. Aminoglycosides, tobramycin in particular, was effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. Prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (EC) enhances the activities of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus gordonii. This phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. The purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and S. epidermidis. An eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or EC to biofilm-coated coupons were used. No significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) CFU/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for S. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes EC were used against MRSA biofilms (P = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes EC against S. epidermidis biofilms (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). The results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by EC is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Urinary infections due to multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli among persons with HIV disease at a tertiary AIDS care centre in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the spectrum of opportunistic infections due to HIV infection has been widely discussed, there are very limited data available in south India on certain incident infections especially urinary tract infections (UTI) in HIV-infected subjects. METHODS: Bacterial aetiology of 350 symptomatic UTI in HIV-infected subjects and the drug resistance pattern of the Escherichia coli isolates tested between June 2005 and July 2007 at the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV Referral Centre in Chennai has been described here. RESULTS: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in HIV patients, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates were multi-drug-resistant and 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary pathogens in HIV-infected patients demonstrate high antimicrobial resistance and with majority of therapy for UTIs being empiric, constant updates of the aetiological agents and their drug susceptibility pattern would largely be beneficial to clinicians in choosing the right drug.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant AAC6'-APH2'' enzyme.
AB  - Vertilmicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside with a structure similar to that of netilmicin except for a methyl group at the C-6' position. In the present study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of vertilmicin was studied, and its susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant aminoglycoside bifunctional modifying enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2'') was compared with those of verdamicin and netilmicin. A total of 1,185 clinical isolates collected from hospitals in Beijing between 2000 and 2001 were subjected to the in vitro antibacterial activity evaluations, including MIC, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and time-kill curve tests. The MICs were evaluated in non-gentamicin-resistant (gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-intermediate) strains and gentamicin-resistant strains, respectively. For most of the non-gentamicin-resistant bacteria (except for the isolates of Pseudomonas spp.), the MIC(90)s of vertilmicin were in the range of 0.5 to 8 microg/ml, comparable to those of the reference aminoglycosides. For the gentamicin-resistant isolates, the three semisynthetic aminoglycosides (vertilmicin, netilmicin, and amikacin) demonstrated low MIC(50)s and/or MIC(90)s, as well as high percent susceptibility values. Among the study drugs, vertilmicin showed the lowest MIC(90)s, 16 microg/ml, for the gram-positive gentamicin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Meanwhile, vertilmicin was a potent bactericidal agent, with MBC/MIC ratios in the range of 1 to 2 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus and 1 to 4 for S. epidermidis. The time-kill curve determination further demonstrated that this effect was rapid and concentration dependent. In evaluations of susceptibility to modifications by the recombinant AAC(6')-APH(2'') with maximum rate of metabolism/K(m) measurements, vertilmicin exhibited susceptibilities to both acetylation and phosphorylation lower than those of netilmicin and verdamicin.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro antibacterial efficacy of PDS plus (polidioxanone with triclosan) suture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the efficacy of polydioxanone suture with and without triclosan against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Polydioxanone suture with and without triclosan was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S. epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli by a zone of inhibition assay. In vivo evaluations were conducted in guinea pigs and mice in which test and control sutures (3-4 cm long) were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal-lateral regions (control on left, test on right, 3-5 cm apart) through a 20 gauge catheter. Each implantation site was then challenged directly through the catheter with 4 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) of S. aureus (guinea pigs) or 7 x 10(6) CFU of E. coli (mice). At 48 h post-implantation, the control and test sutures were explanted, and adherent bacteria were counted. RESULTS: Polydioxanone suture with triclosan demonstrated activity against all test organisms in vitro. The antibacterial activity was maintained until the sutures dissolved after 17 to 23 days when tested against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Evaluation in animal models demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in S. aureus and a 90% reduction in E. coli relative to controls. CONCLUSION: Polydioxanone suture with triclosan had activity in vitro against S. aureus, MRSA, E. coli, S. epidermidis, MRSE, and K. pneumoniae that persisted for as long as three weeks. In animal models, polydioxanone suture with triclosan inhibited in vivo colonization by S. aureus and E. coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of Salvia chloroleuca.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  Shahrestanak (Tehran province of Iran). The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-Pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of S. chloroleuca was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Anti-biofilm properties of chitosan-coated surfaces.
AB  - Surfaces coated with the naturally-occurring polysaccharide chitosan (partially deacetylated poly N-acetyl glucosamine) resisted biofilm formation by bacteria and yeast. Reductions in biofilm viable cell numbers ranging from 95% to 99.9997% were demonstrated for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans on chitosan-coated surfaces over a 54-h experiment in comparison to controls. For instance, chitosan-coated surfaces reduced S. epidermidis surface-associated growth more than 5.5 (10)log units (99.9997%) compared to a control surface. As a comparison, coatings containing a combination of the antibiotics minocycline and rifampin reduced S. epidermidis growth by 3.9 (10)log units (99.99%) and coatings containing the antiseptic chlorhexidine did not significantly reduce S. epidermidis surface associated growth as compared to controls. The chitosan effects were confirmed with microscopy. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent-dye-loaded S. epidermidis, the permeabilization of these cells was observed as they alighted on chitosan-coated surfaces. This suggests chitosan disrupts cell membranes as microbes settle on the surface. Chitosan offers a flexible, biocompatible platform for designing coatings to protect surfaces from infection.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Protected Denomination of Origin Portuguese semihard cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. Standard plate counts (log CFU per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. Species identified within this family encompassed Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Escherichia coli; Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella terrigena, and Serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. No Salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. Viable counts of Micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. Species identified within this family encompassed Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and Staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). Accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and pH. Statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of Micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and moisture content than between viable numbers and pH. The results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the indicators total mesophile and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100- and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. However, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4 months of ripening), Sao Jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus, as well as absence of Salmonella.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton Agar on Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2006].
AB  - Using broth micro-dilution method, we studied the susceptibility of 180 clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis to meropenem (MEPM) and reference agents. All strains were isolated from the blood of patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January 2006 and November 2006. The results were as follows: 1. MEPM showed greater potency against Gram-negative bacteria than the other carbapenems including doripenem in particular. A metallo-beta-lactamase producing multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa strain was detected. 2. A comparison of the antibacterial activity of MEPM with that in our previous studies 1997-1998, 1999, 2002-2003, and 2004 showed no marked increase in MEPM-resistant clinical isolates. These results suggest that MEPM retains its potency as the agent of choice in treating serious infections.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Two new antibacterial norabietane diterpenoids from cyanobacteria, Microcoleous lacustris.
AB  - Two abietane diterpenes were isolated from cyanobacteria Microcoleous lacustris,  20-nor-3alpha-acetoxyabieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene and 20-nor-3alpha-acetoxy-12-hydroxy-abieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene. These compounds were assayed against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both compounds showed activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. typhi, and V. cholerae, but not against the other bacteria.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].

TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - [Epidemiology and susceptibility profile of blood culture isolates in an intensive care unit (2002-2005)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotics susceptibility of bacteria identified in blood culture in the intensive care unit, to improve empirical antibiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was made over a four-year period (2002-2005) in the intensive care unit of the Mohammed-V Military Hospital. It included all the bacteria identified in blood culture. RESULTS: During this period, we collected 286 isolates, Gram-negative bacilli 49.3% and Gram-positive cocci 46.85%. The most frequently identified species were Acinetobacter baumannii (13.63%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 25.54%: Klebsiella pneumoniae 7%, and Enterobacter cloacae 7%. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 52.94 % and coagulase negative staphylococci 60.24%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 42.6 % and had a broad-spectrum betalactamase phenotype in 18%. The resistance rate of A. baumannii was 68.7% for ceftazidime and 31.4% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to the third generation cephalosporines and the imipenem were respectively 16.6% and 10.5%. CONCLUSION: A regular epidemiologic study of blood culture isolates and determination of susceptibility to antibiotics are necessary to improve empiric therapy.
TI  - [Pertussis toxin and cross-reactive antigens in dynamics of Bordetella pertussis  cultivation].
AB  - Cultures of Bordetella pertussis from phases of exponential growth, retarded growth and from stationary phase were obtained during periodic dynamic cultivation. Preparations for intravenous immunization of rabbits were made from these cultures. Levels of IgG to pertussis toxin, cell walls preparations from 12 bacterial species, 4 organo-specific antigens, and 7 organospecific human antigens were measured in obtained sera. It was shown that higher levels of IgG to pertussis toxin were found in sera of rabbits immunized with cultures from exponential growth phase whereas decrease of this level in 8 times was observed in sera of rabbits immunized with cultures from retarded growth phase or end of stationary phase. After immunization with culture from exponential growth phase increase of IgG levels to cross-reactive antigens was not observed compared to levels of these antibodies in control sera obtained before immunization. After immunization with cultures from retarded growth phase or end of stationary phase increase of IgG levels to preparations of cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, to denaturated DNA, elastin, and renal and liver microsomal fractions was detected compared to control sera. Described data can substantiate usefulness of obtaining the most specific diagnostic sera and test-systems using cultures of B. pertussis from the phase of exponential growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  - Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Risk factors for central venous catheter-related infections in pediatric intensive care.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for short-term percutaneously inserted central venous catheter-related infections in children and to evaluate the accuracy of a mortality score in predicting the risk of infection. METHOD: After reviewing the charts of patients who developed catheter-related infection in a university hospital's pediatric intensive care unit, we conducted a case-controlled study with 51 pairs. Variables related to patients and to catheter insertion and use were analyzed. Risk factors were defined by logistic regression analysis. The accuracy of the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score to discriminate the risk for infection was tested using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. RESULTS: Infection was associated with respiratory failure, patient's length of stay, duration of tracheal intubation, insertion of catheter in the intensive care unit and parenteral nutrition. Insertion site (femoral or internal jugular) was unimportant. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following variables. Risk factors included more than one catheter placement (p=0.014) and duration of catheter use (p=0.0013), and protective factors included concomitant antibiotic use (p=0.0005) and an intermittent infusion regimen followed by heparin filling compared to continuous infusion without heparin (p=0.0002). Pediatric Risk of Mortality did not discriminate the risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Central parenteral nutrition and central venous catheters should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Femoral vein catheterization carries a risk of infection similar to internal jugular catheterization. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality score should not be used to predict the risk of central catheter-related infections.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride on bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - AIM: To study the effect of antiseptics on bacterial biofilm formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biofilm formation and planktonic growth were tested in microtiter plates in the presence of antiseptics. For Escherichia coli G1473 in the presence of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, for Klebsiella pneumoniae CF504 in the presence of chlorhexidine and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of antiseptics. For PAO1 in the presence of chlorhexidine and CF504 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, planktonic growth was significantly inhibited by a fourfold lower antiseptic concentration than biofilm development. For Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP53124 in the presence of antiseptics at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), a total inhibition of biofilm formation was observed. For Staph. epidermidis exposed to chlorhexidine at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC, or to benzalkonium chloride at 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC, biofilm formation was increased from 11.4% to 22.5% without any significant effect onto planktonic growth. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride inhibited biofilm formation of different bacterial species but were able to induce biofilm development for the Staph. epidermidis CIP53124 strain at sub-MICs. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sublethal exposure to cationic antiseptics may contribute to the persistence of staphylococci through biofilm induction.
TI  - Sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). Uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. In all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in order to assess motility as a function of time. Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. Besides these bacterial strains, Candida albicans was also used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism concentration. However, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was prominent. Regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. No or poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with E. aerogenes at the second hour. The data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. Instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity, and quantitative structure-activity relationships of new (Z)-2-(nitroimidazolylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranone derivatives.
AB  - A new series of (Z)-2-(1-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-2-ylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranones (11a-p) and (Z)-2-(1-methyl-4-nitroimidazole-5-ylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranones (12a-m) were synthesized and assayed for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Most of the 5-nitroimidazole analogues (11a-p) showed a remarkable inhibition of a wide spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, MRSA, and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas 4-nitroimidazole analogues (12a-m) were not effective against selected bacteria. The quantitative structure-activity relationship investigations were applied to find out the correlation between the experimentally evaluated activities with various parameters of the compounds studied. The QSAR models built in this work had reasonable predictive power and could be explained by the observed trends in activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Salvia species essential oils from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia multicaulis, S. sclarea and S. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. In contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of S. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial inactivation in prestorage pooled, leukoreduced, whole blood-derived platelet concentrates suspended in plasma prepared with photochemical treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photochemical treatment (PCT) with amotosalen and ultraviolet light was developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet (PLT) components suspended in 35 percent plasma and 65 percent additive solution (AS). Because PLT additive solutions (ASs) are not used in the United States, this study evaluated the ability of the PCT process to inactivate low levels of bacteria in pooled whole blood-derived PLTs (RDP) suspended in 100 percent plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four replicate experiments were performed with two Gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, and two Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. For each experiment, 6 ABO-identical RDP units were pooled, leukoreduced before or after pooling, inoculated to approximately 1 to 10 colony-forming units per mL with plasma-resistant bacteria, and treated with the PCT process. Residual viable bacterial levels were measured before and after each step and 4 and 6 days after inoculation. For each bacterium studied, a fifth RDP pool was prepared and contaminated, but not treated. These units served as controls for bacterial growth. RESULTS: Growth of S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and K. pneumoniae was eliminated in all four treated pools while growth continued in the control pools. There was no growth of E. coli in the treated pools and the control pool. CONCLUSION: These pilot experiments demonstrate inactivation of bacteria in PLTs suspended in plasma, suggesting that the PCT process may address contamination in conventional RDPs. Additional experiments with a wider range of bacteria and evaluation of PLT function in 100 percent plasma will be needed before implementation.
TI  - Intrathecal baclofen does not inhibit the growth of different bacterial species and Candida albicans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity of intrathecal baclofen was investigated.  Several different microorganisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains); S epidermidis; Enterococcus faecalis; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Candida albicans. METHODS: Three experimental approaches were used to assess baclofen antimicrobial activity: (1) determination of the MIC; (2) determination of the MBC; and (3) kinetic time-kill assay. Experiments were performed according to current methods of the NCCLS. RESULTS: As compared with control organisms exposed to physiologic saline, organisms exposed to baclofen over a 10-day period failed to reduce the number of viable cells by at least 3 log(10), as requested by NCCLS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Because the viability of the investigated organisms was not reduced over that of microbial suspensions exposed to physiologic saline, we conclude that intrathecal baclofen has no measurable activity against different bacterial species and C albicans.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of positive and negative polarity low-voltage pulsed current (LVPC) on six typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of chronic wounds.
AB  - The positive effect of electrical stimulation (ES) on wound healing has been shown in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of increased blood flow, protein denaturation, and stimulation of cellular defense, an antibacterial effect of ES is to be expected. Although the antibacterial effect of ES already has been demonstrated in vitro, little attention has been paid to the direct antibacterial effect of changing polarity of the applied current. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of positive and negative monophasic low-voltage pulsed current on typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens of chronic wounds. Using the Dermapulse-System, three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia faecium) organisms were tested against positive and negative polarity low voltage pulsed current. All tested organisms were significantly reduced by ES. The reduction differed significantly between positive polarity and control and negative polarity and control, with the highest log10 reduction factor (RF) achieved with positive polarity. Using positive polarity, the maximum RF was measured for E. coli (median log10 RF 0.83; 25th percentile 0.59, 75th percentile 0.98) and the lowest for S. epidermidis (median log10 RF 0.20; 25th percentile 0.17, 75th percentile 0.24). Yet, there was no significant difference with positive ES against Gram-positive or Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of MONOCRYL plus antibacterial suture (Poliglecaprone 25 with triclosan).
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of poliglecaprone 25 suture with triclosan against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Poliglecaprone 25 sutures with and without triclosan were tested for in vitro efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli by a zone of inhibition assay. The suture also was tested against Escherichia coli in a colonization assay in a dynamic model simulating in vivo conditions. An in vitro triclosan diffusion assay and a sustained efficacy assay were performed by concurrent high-performance liquid chromatography and zone of inhibition assay. To assess stability, antibacterial efficacy testing was performed on samples held more than five months at elevated temperature. RESULTS: Poliglecaprone 25 suture with triclosan demonstrated significant in vitro efficacy against a range of bacteria. The suture sustained in vitro efficacy for 11 days, corresponding to the in vitro triclosan diffusion profile. CONCLUSION: Triclosan reduced in vitro colonization of poliglecaprone 25 suture by several strains of bacteria compared with untreated control sutures.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates prepared from spiked single donations using cultural and molecular genetic methods.
AB  - Bacteria show differences in their growth kinetics depending on the type of blood component. On to storage at 22 degrees C, platelet concentrates (PCs) seem to be more prone to bacterial multiplication than red cell concentrates. Knowledge of the potential for bacterial proliferation in blood components, which are stored at a range of temperatures, is essential before considering implementation of a detection strategy. The efficacy of bacterial detection was determined, using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), following bacterial growth in blood components obtained from a deliberately contaminated whole-blood (WB) unit. Cultivation was used as the reference method. WB was spiked with 2 colony-forming units mL(-1)Staphylococcus epidermidis or Klebsiella pneumoniae, kept for 15 h at room temperature and component preparation was processed. Samples were drawn, at intervals throughout the whole separation process, from each blood component. Nucleic acids were extracted using an automated high-volume extraction method. The 15-h storage revealed an insignificant increase in bacterial titre. No bacterial growth was detected in red blood cell or plasma units. K. pneumoniae showed rapid growth in the pooled PC and could be detected immediately after preparation using RT-PCR. S. epidermidis grew slowly and was detected 24 h after separation. These experiments show that sampling is indicative at 24 h after preparation of PCs at the earliest to minimize the sampling error.
TI  - Amniotic membrane transplantation in severe bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (BK) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids. METHODS: In a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven BK were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by AMT at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. Pain relief (NRS-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured. RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with AMT performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with BK caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Moraxella cattharalis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). A significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7-10) to shortly after AMT (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1-3). Epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and 45 days (mean, 25.5 +/- 9.7 days). Neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early AMT combined with topical corticosteroid in severe BK provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.
TI  - Bismuth-norfloxacin complex: synthesis, physicochemical and antimicrobial evaluation.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent which is active against various Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative microorganisms. Presence of metal ions considerably alters the activity of fluoroquinolones against potentially susceptible bacteria. As bismuth is known to possess a good antibacterial activity, bismuth complex of norfloxacin was prepared by reacting bismuth citrate with aqueous solution of norfloxacin. The structure of the bismuth-norfloxacin complex (BNC) was confirmed by spectral, chemical and elemental analysis. Antimicrobial studies were carried out using agar diffusion method against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Klebsiella pneumoniae (NTCC 10320), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Bacillus pumilis (NTCC 8241) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228). The results showed significant increase (p<0.05, Tukeys test) in antibacterial activity of BNC as compared with norfloxacin and physical mixture of norfloxacin and bismuth citrate. This increase in activity is being considered due to increased bioavailability of the metal drug complex. Thus, the use of the BNC may be preferable over norfloxacin alone.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition of the essential oil of Gontscharovia popovii from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Gontscharovia popovii (B. Fedtsch. and Gontsch.) Boriss. were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one components were identified with the main constituent being carvacrol (71.9%), followed by linalool (5.5%), p-cymene (4.5%) and gamma-terpinene (4.4%). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of G. popovii was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the tested fungi and bacteria except for the resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Construction of a leftover bath water model for microbial testing.
AB  - In this study, in order to construct a model of leftover bath water, we analyzed  one hundred samples of used bath water samples which were provided by twenty-eight volunteer families. It appeared that the number of detected bacteria from such bath water was correlated closely with the number of bathers. Moreover, the pH, acidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ion, protein content of the leftover bath water were measured. The number of bathers had no connection with the pH, acidity, COD, and ion content of the leftover bath water. However, the protein content of the bath water correlated with the number of detected bacteria. Based on these results, the model of leftover bath water was constructed. Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with the model bath water as indices of bath water contamination. The number of incubated viable cells in the model bath water increased with increasing concentrations of casamino acid. Consequently, it was suggested that varying the concentration of casamino acid based on family size or contamination would be necessary in the efficient use of the constructed model of leftover bath water for microbial testing.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. was  identified by GC and GC-MS analysis. The analysis of the oil resulted in the identification of forty-five components constituting 98.6% of the total oil. The main constituents were a-pinene (31.5%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (23.3%), p-cymene (6.7%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was tested by the disk diffusion method against four Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria together with a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The oil showed strong inhibition activity toward all the tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of plasma with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates pathogens while retaining coagulation function.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The INTERCEPT Blood System, a photochemical treatment (PCT) process,  has been developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet concentrates. These studies evaluated the efficacy of PCT to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of PCT on plasma function. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Jumbo (600 mL) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 micromol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) long-wavelength ultraviolet light. The viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. Plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities. RESULTS: The levels of inactivation expressed as log-reduction were as follows: cell-free human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), greater than 6.8; cell-associated HIV-1, greater than 6.4; human T-lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I), 4.5; HTLV-II, greater than 5.7; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus, greater than 4.5; duck HBV, 4.4 to 4.5; bovine viral diarrhea virus, 6.0; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 5.5; West Nile virus, 6.8; bluetongue virus, 5.1; human adenovirus 5, 6.8; Klebsiella pneumoniae, greater than 7.4; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Yersinia enterocolitica, greater than 7.3; Treponema pallidum, greater than 5.9; Borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; Plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; Trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and Babesia microti, greater than 5.3. Retention of coagulation factor activity after PCT was expressed as the proportion of pretreatment (baseline) activity. Retention was 72 to 73 percent of baseline fibrinogen and Factor (F)VIII activity and 78 to 98 percent for FII, FV, FVII, F IX, FX, FXI, FXIII, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and alpha2-antiplasmin. CONCLUSION: PCT of plasma inactivated high levels of a wide range of pathogens while maintaining adequate coagulation function. PCT has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases in patients requiring plasma transfusion support.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida).
AB  - Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida Cv. Asteraceae: Campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. Seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from CH2Cl2 and MeOH extracts from aerial parts of T. lucida. In addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-Methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (Sigma-Aldrich). All of these compounds and extracts (M1 and M2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial activity was determined on Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella sp., Shigella boydii, Shigella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterolitica, Vibrio cholerae (three El Tor strains, CDC-V12, clinic case, and INDRE-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and V. cholerae (NO-O1). The evaluated fungi were Aspergillus niger, Penicillium notatum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium sporotrichum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most active compounds against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. In addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against V. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. Coumarins were the most effective compounds against Gram-negative bacteria. The extract MeOH/CH2Cl2 (1: 4) M2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of E. coli and P. mirabilis (40%), K. pneumoniae (31.1%), Salmonella sp. (35.5%), and Shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. The dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal strains, especially T. mentagrophytes and R. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ZnII, CdII, and HgII complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of GlmU enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  - The colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. We have developed an antibiofilm composition comprising an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (GlmU) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. The antibiofilm activity of GlmU inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (IDA), N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and NEM analogs, including N-phenyl maleimide, N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (oPDM), and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PyrM), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. Both IDA and NEM inhibited biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. All NEM analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The combination of oPDM with protamine sulfate (PS) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microM. In addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters against P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. Confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. Thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a GlmU inhibitor and protamine sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activities of some medicinal plants from Cameroon.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of 10 plant species (Voacanga africana, Crepis cameroonica, Plagiostyles africana, Crotalaria retusa, Mammea africana, Lophira lanceolata, Ochna afzelii, Ouratea elongata, Ou. flava and Ou. sulcata), each of which is currently used in the traditional medicine of Cameroon, were investigated in vitro. The activities of a methanol extract of each plant were tested, in disc-diffusion assays, against 37 reference or laboratory strains of seven species of microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of each extract were then estimated, against each of the more susceptible microorganisms (i.e. those giving an inhibition zone measuring at least 9 mm in diameter in the disc-diffusion assays), by agar dilution. Although, in the disc-diffusion assays, each of the 10 methanol extracts investigated displayed some degree of antimicrobial activity against at least one species of microorganism, no activity against the Gram-negative bacteria (Es. coli, K. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa) was observed. The extract with the greatest antimicrobial activity was that of Pl. africana (Euphorbiaceae).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Ethanol disinfection of plastic-adherent micro-organisms.
AB  - This study investigated the bactericidal effect of ethanol/water (70:30 vol:vol)  against plastic-adherent organisms that commonly cause line infections. The experiments were performed in polycarbonate wells and all incubations were at 37 degrees C. Bacteria in broth were inoculated into wells and incubated (16, 40 and 72 h) before washing to remove non-adherent organisms and exposure to ethanol/water. Wells were then re-incubated with broth to detect surviving bacteria. All organisms incubated for 16 h were killed by 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol. After incubation for 40 h, 4h of exposure to ethanol was required to kill two strains of Candida albicans. Likewise, one of three of both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, incubated for 72 h, showed growth after 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol but not after 4h of exposure. These results suggest that in contrast to log phase organisms, which are killed by ethanol/water solutions in seconds, plastic-adherent organisms are more resistant to the bactericidal activity of ethanol.
TI  - Antimicrobial titanium/silver PVD coatings on titanium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation and deep infection of endoprostheses is a recurrent complication in implant surgery. Post-operative infections may be overcome by adjusting antimicrobial properties of the implant surface prior to implantation. In this work we described the development of an antimicrobial titanium/silver hard coating via the physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. METHODS: Coatings with a thickness of approximately 2 mum were deposited on titanium surfaces by simultaneous vaporisation of both metals in an inert argon atmosphere with a silver content of approximately 0.7-9% as indicated by energy dispersive X-ray analysis. On these surfaces microorganisms and eukaryotic culture cells were grown. RESULTS: The coatings released sufficient silver ions (0.5-2.3 ppb) when immersed in PBS and showed significant antimicrobial potency against Staphylococcus epidermis and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. At the same time, no cytotoxic effects of the coatings on osteoblast and epithelial cells were found. CONCLUSION: Due to similar mechanical performance when compared to pure titanium, the TiAg coatings should be suitable to provide antimicrobial activity on load-bearing implant surfaces.
TI  - Sterility testing of platelet concentrates prepared from deliberately infected blood donations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In general the bacterial count in freshly donated blood is low and even lower in the corresponding platelet concentrates (PCs). By use of flow cytometry (FACS) for sterility testing, the reliability of early versus later sampling times was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood donations were spiked with various numbers of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The corresponding PCs were prepared by the buffy-coat method and stored at 22 degrees C. A 20-mL sample was collected from each PC directly after preparation and after 8 hours. Samples were stored at 35 degrees C. Sterility testing of both PCs and samples was by FACS analysis at different time points. RESULTS: All stored PCs were found positive by FACS analysis, with detection times ranging between 8 and 24 hours (K. pneumoniae, B. cereus), 8 and 91 hours (S. aureus), and 144 hours (S. epidermidis). In the samples incubated at 35 degrees C, bacteria were detected after 8 to 19 hours (K. pneumoniae, B. cereus), 8 to 67 hours (S. aureus), and 19 to 43 hours (S. epidermidis). Some of the samples did not contain bacteria. CONCLUSION: Detection times for slow-growing bacteria are significantly shortened when PC samples are incubated at 35 degrees C: the numbers of bacteria in freshly prepared PCs may, however, be so low that the samples drawn for sterility testing do not contain a single bacterium. Our results do not support a shortening of the 24-hour or greater sampling time recommended by the manufacturers of established test systems, because also for consistent detection by FACS, bacteria need to grow in the PCs to sufficient numbers.
TI  - Erythromycin synergism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to establish the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of erythromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of erythromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with erythromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations reveal that formation of erythromycin complexes result in synergistic effect i.e., antimicrobial activity of complexes of erythromycin increases with respect to parent erythromycin drug and MIC of drug metal complexes decreased.
TI  - Roxithromycin antagonism with essential and trace elements.
AB  - In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various macrolide antibiotics, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of roxithromycin metal complexes have been studied and compared with the parent drug. Metal complexes of roxithromycin with magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium have been investigated for their antibacterial activity and compared with roxithromycin by observing the changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. Various microorganisms used were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella dysentery, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For MIC observation, serial dilution method was employed and zone sizes were determined by diffusion disk method. Our investigations divulge that formation of roxithromycin complexes results in antagonistic behavior against few microorganisms where in MIC is increased with respect to the parent drug, while against most of the microorganism, there was no effect on the MIC of the roxithromycin metal complexes with respect to parent roxithromycin.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - A study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. Multiple site cultures may improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. We hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. DESIGN/METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis. A minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. Based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. RESULTS: A total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. In all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. In all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. All neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. The other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. The single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by Listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3), combined MRSA and Candida albicans (2), Candida albicans alone (2), late-onset Group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GBS) (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Enterococcus fecalis (1), Escherichia coli (1), and Serratia marcescens (1). Since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. CONCLUSIONS: Two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. Sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood volume of>or=1 ml.
TI  - [Trend of antimicrobial drug-susceptibility of blood isolates at an oncological center (1998-2003)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the Bactec and Microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. The percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were Gram negative bacteria, 35.7% Gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. E. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and Klebsiella spp (9%). Throughout the study the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli stayed around 50%. Susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. S. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for vancomycin was 98.6%. No strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis treated successfully with polymyxin B.
AB  - Peritonitis is not an infrequent complication of inpatients with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD peritonitis may be related to the catheter or secondary to perforation of an intra-abdominal viscus. The most common organisms usually associated with CAPD peritonitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (coagulase-negative staphylococci). Rarely, aerobic gram-negative bacilli have been the causative agents of CAPD peritonitis. The treatment of CAPD peritonitis usually requires removal of the peritoneal catheter and treatment with parenteral antibiotics active against the causative pathogen. We report a case of CAPD-associated peritonitis caused by an extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The case presented had this strain of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae present in blood cultures and the peritoneal fluid. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, for example, K. pneumoniae, are multidrug-resistant and sensitive to few antibiotics. This isolate was intermediately sensitive to amikacin and meropenem, but the patient did not clinically improve on these 2 antibiotics. Polymyxin B therapy was initiated after lack of clinical improvement after dialysis catheter removal and 1 week of meropenem and amikacin therapy. The patient responded rapidly to therapy with polymyxin B. Polymyxin B has a unique mechanism of action on bacterial cells and is highly active against all multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms except Proteus species and Serratia marcescens. No toxicity was observed during therapy. Polymyxin B is being used increasingly as a therapeutic alternative to multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [Study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. METHODS: For all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time CSF was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to antibiotics. After the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. As soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. By the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. RESULTS: Among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with Streptococci, and another one with Mycobacterium stercoris bovis. The tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. There were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. Practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of streptococcal infection. The duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. Finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. CONCLUSION: (1)Intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)The effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)There are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.
TI  - [Pathogens and drug resistance of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial resistance and bacterial distribution of nosocomial pneumonia in neurosurgical patients. METHODS: We analyzed and counted the result of sputum culture, drug sensibilities test, and the rate of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery of all the patients in the Department of in Neurosurgery our hospital in 2002. RESULTS: The rate of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery was 6.2%. The first 5 strains were pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacteriaceae, klebsiella, and staphylococcus epidermidis. Statistics of drug sensibility test suggested:the rate of ampicillin and cefuroxime resistance was over 83%. Gram-negative bacterium was the first sensitive to sulperazon and imipenem. Gram-positive bacterium was the first sensitive to vancomycin, ampicillin/sulbactam and rifampicin. CONCLUSION: The rate of neurosurgical infection was high. The most common pathogens were gram-negative bacteria. Drug resistance was serious.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Tetrasodium EDTA as a novel central venous catheter lock solution against biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central venous catheter (CVC)-related bloodstream infections (BSIs) are known to increase rates of morbidity and mortality in both inpatients and outpatients, including hematology-oncology patients and those undergoing hemodialysis or home infusion therapy. Biofilm-associated organisms on the lumens of these catheters have reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial chemotherapy. This study tested the efficacy of tetrasodium EDTA as a catheter lock solution on biofilms of several clinically relevant microorganisms. METHODS: Biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans were grown to levels of approximately 1 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(-1) on CVC segments in a model system, then subjected to the tetrasodium EDTA lock treatment. RESULTS: Comparisons of biofilms before and after exposure to the 40-mg/mL(-1) tetrasodium EDTA lock for 21 hours showed that the biofilm viable cell counts of all organisms tested were significantly reduced (P < .05) after exposure to the treatment. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial lock treatment using 40 mg/mL(-1) of tetrasodium EDTA for at least 21 hours could significantly reduce or potentially eradicate CVC-associated biofilms of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - [Nosocomial bacteremia: epidemiology and current antimicrobial drugs resistances].
AB  - Nosocomial bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A change is being observed in the distribution of its causative agents, as well as an increase in the resistances to some antimicrobial drugs. We have analyzed 600 significant bacteremia episodes during the year 2002, studying the resistances to antimicrobial drugs and some epidemiological aspects. Bacteremias caused by gram-positive were 57%, while the ones caused by gram-negative were 46.1%. The three microorganisms more frequently isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In S. aureus low resistance to oxacillin (10.3%) was observed. Streptococcus pneumoniae with lower sensitivity to penicillin was observed in 49.9%. Resistance of gram-positive microorganisms to vancomycin/teicoplanin was not observed. E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed low prevalence of expanded spectrum ss-lactamase strains. There are differences in epidemiology of bacteremias at regional level, and continuous local programs for monitoring resistances to antimicrobial drugs are needed.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Protozoan grazing and its impact upon population dynamics in biofilm communities.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the impact of protozoan grazing on the population dynamics of  a multispecies bacterial biofilm community. METHODS AND RESULTS: Grazing by Acanthamoeba castellanii and the ciliate Colpoda maupasi upon biofilm and planktonic communities, composed of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. Biofilms were formed using glass coverslips, held in a carousel device, as substrata for biofilm formation or in glass flow cells. The predatory effects of the amoeba were generally confined to the biofilm, where grazing rates corresponded to losses from the biofilm equivalent to ca 30,000 biofilm cells cm(-2) h(-1), with the amoeba becoming an integral part of the community. C. maupasi reduced the thickness of mature multispecies biofilms at steady-state from 500 to <200 microm. CONCLUSIONS: We report that the presence of the protozoa A. castellanii and C. maupasi markedly influence population dynamics within defined biofilm communities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The current study dispels the popular opinion that biofilms are protected against predation by protozoa. A. castellanii clearly has the capacity to graze mixed biofilm communities and to become integrally associated with them, whereas the ciliate C. maupasi reduced biofilm thickness by up to 60%.
TI  - The binding of MBL to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To purify Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. METHODS: MBL was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-Sepharose 4B column. Its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). RESULTS: MBL has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to Klebsiella ornithinolytica and Escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To different isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, MBL shows quite different binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: MBL has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to Gram-negative bacteria. Its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Decontamination of surfaces by lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles.
AB  - Cells and enzymes can be used to decontaminate soil, water supplies, personal equipment, weapons and hospital equipment that have been exposed to bacteria, toxins or viruses. One of the problems associated with the use of microorganisms and enzymes for decontamination purposes is that the presence of water is not acceptable for some applications such as electronic equipment. One way of circumventing this problem is to allow the enzyme to distribute between a water phase and an organic phase-containing surfactant and then use the encapsulated enzyme in reverse micelles directly into the device to be clean. Reverse micelles were used to deliver the enzyme (lysozyme) to the cell-surface interface. They serve as a way to increase the local concentration of lysozyme and decrease the amount of water delivered. Specifically, we explored the lysis by free lysozyme and lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis attached to steel, glass, and hydroxyapatite. These two bacteria have been selected because they are known to be pathogenic and because of their differences in cell wall structure. Lysozyme was added to the surfaces in either reverse micelles or as a free solution and was tested under conditions of stirring and no stirring. Stirring was implemented to study the interplay between mass transfer limitations and surface roughness. We have shown that free lysozyme or lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles is capable of decontaminating surfaces of different texture. Lysis of the cells is slower when the encapsulated enzyme is used but lysis is more complete.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC90 of MEPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. MEPM was active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). 2. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenems including MEPM were active against these ESBL strains. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Kidney transplants from infected donors: our experience.
AB  - Organ procurement from infected donors may transmit a disease to the recipient that could cause a graft loss and/or recipient morbidity. Retrospectively, all kidney transplants from infected donors at our center in the last 4 years were reviewed. A donor was considered infected in the presence of at least one positive culture before procurement. From January 1999 to 2003, 23 of 160 donors (14.5%) were infected: in 10 donors a positive blood culture; in 3, a urine culture; and in 13, a bronchial culture. In a further 12 (7%) donors, only the preservation solution was contaminated. Organisms isolated were: Staphylococcus coagulase.neg. (n = 7); Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3); Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4); Acinetobacter (n = 1); Candida albicans (n = 13); Aspergillus (n = 1); and Escherichia coli (n = 1). All except 2 kidneys were transplanted with positivity in all cultures. All recipients received general, nonspecific, antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis until the antibiotic and antifungal spectrum was ready. Patient and graft survival rates at 6 months were 94% and 93%, respectively. Two deaths occurred due to bacterial arteritis (P aeruginosa), and 2 acute graft losses due to fungal arteritis. Kidneys from infected donors seem suitable for transplants. Only grafts infected by vasculotropic agents (S aureus, P aeruginosa, and C albicans) should be discarded.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  - Standard microbiological tests (i.e., MIC) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. Our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (PFT) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. The methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. Thirty-six clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. In the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis. Titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. Titers were highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. Overall, PFTs were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.0001). The addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.0001). In the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (P = 0.036). In conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the PFT as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of PD-related peritonitis. With further characterization and validation in patients, the PFT test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for PD-related peritonitis.
TI  - Cyclic peptide alkaloids from the bark of Discaria americana.
AB  - The isolation and structure determination of cyclic peptide alkaloids, discarine-M and discarine-N, along with seven known cyclic peptide alkaloids, adouetine-Y', franganine, frangulanine, discarines-A, -B, -C, and -D from the root bark of Discaria americana are described. Structures were determined spectroscopically, especially using 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. The crude methanol extract, the basic ether extract, and the alkaloids 6 and 7 also weakly inhibited growth of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - [Increasing trend of antimicrobial drug-resistance in organisms causing bacteremia at a tertiary-care hospital: 1995 to 2000].
AB  - We described the trends of drug-resistant organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a teaching hospital from 1995 to 2000. We found an increase in the number of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Enterococcus spp, resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat infections caused by these organisms. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones increased during the period of study, and in 2000 more than 20% of the isolates were resistant. In contrast, the frequency of resistance to aminoglycosides and carbapenems was less than 20%. The frequency of resistant staphylococci increased exuberantly fifty fold to quinolones and five fold to oxacillin during the study period, therefore in 2000, 26.1% of S. aureus isolates and 61% of S. epidermidis were resistant to oxacillin. The frequency of resistant enterococci also increased, and in 2000, 50% were resistant to ampicillin, and 37.5% to gentamicin. The increase of drug resistant organisms isolated in blood had a direct impact in the empirical treatment of severely infected patients in our hospital. It is important to continuously supervise antibiotic use, and to adopt more strict control measures to decrease the frequency of infections caused by drug resistant organisms.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - [Molecular diagnosis of the specific DNA patterns of 16S-23S rRNA gene of bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the specific 16S-23S rRNA gene spacer regions pattern in  different bacteria using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), DNA cloning and sequences analysis. METHODS: A pair of primers were selected from highly conserved sequences adjacent to the 16S-23S rRNA spacer region. Bacterial DNA of sixty-one strains of standard bacteria and corresponding clinical isolates representative of 20 genera and 27 species was amplified by PCR, and further studied by RFLP, DNA cloning and sequences analysis. Meanwhile, all specimens were examined by bacterial culturing and PCR-RFLP analysis. RESULTS: The 27 different standard strains showed one, two, three or more than three bands. The sensitivity of PCR reached 2.5 colony-forming unit (CFU), and there was no cross reaction to the human, fungal or viral genomic DNAs. Fifteen species could be distinguished immediately by PCR, while another 10 species were further identified by Hinf I or Alu I digestion. Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and Enterococcus durans (Ed) could not be differentiated from each other by Alu I or Hinf I digestion. The spacer sequences of the Kp and Ed were 908 bp and 909 bp, respectively, and they differed only at the site of the 779th nucleotide. The former was G, and the latter was A. The 760 - 790 bp sequence of Kp was as follows: CGACTGCACCGCCTCCTAC / GGCCGCGTATTC. The 760 - 790 bp sequence of Ed was as follows: CGACTGCAC CGCCTCCTAC / AGCCGCGTATTC. Only one enzyme XmaIII, could discriminate the two. The cleaving site of XmaIII is C downward arrow GGCCG. Kp DNA was cleaved into 778 bp and 130 bp fragments, while E. durans was not. Of 42 specimens with suspected septicemia, 15 were positive (35.7%) on blood culture, and 27 on PCR (64.29%). The positive rate of PCR was significantly higher than that of blood culture (P < 0.01). Of the six CSF specimens, one was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se) on culture as well as by PCR, while two specimens which were negative on cultures were positive by PCR and were diagnosed as Se according to its DNA pattern. One specimen was culture-positive for Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) but was negative by PCR. The other two specimens were negative by both PCR and culture. Fifteen blood samples from healthy children were negative by both blood culture and PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The method of detecting bacterial 16S-23S rRNA spacer regions using PCR-RFLP techniques was specific, sensitive, rapid and accurate in detecting pathogens in clinical bacterial infections.
TI  - [Impact of secondary pancreatic infection on the prognosis of patients with severe acute pancreatitis: an analysis of 60 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of secondary pancreatic infection (SPI) on the prognosis of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Clinical data of 60 patients with SAP (January 1, 1980-December 31, 1999), especially the data at the onset of SPI, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty patients were divided into two groups: SPI group (29 cases) and non-SPI group (31 cases). There was no significant difference in gender, average age, scores of Ranson and of high risk factors of China Medical Association between two groups, but the average stay days in hospital, payment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, days of fever, prehospital days, days of high white blood cell (WBC) count, the duration of constipation after the onset of SAP and average times of operation were significantly higher in SPI group than that of non-SPI group. Fatality rate of SPI group (7/29, 24.14 percent) was higher than that of non-SPI (1/31, 3.23 percent). There were 14 cases of infection with single microorganism (48.3 percent) and 15 cases of mixed infection (51.7 percent) in SPI group. Twenty-seven patients were infected with bacteria of Enterobacteriaecae (Escherichia 25, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Proteus morgani 1, 8 with bacteria of Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa 7, P. stanieri 1), 2 with fungus, 5 with other bacteria (Bacillus subtilis 2, Tetracoccus 1, Acetobacteraceae 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) in SPI group. Only in 2 patients with infective pancreatic necrosis the blood culture was positive (Escherichia coli). CONCLUSION: These results showed that the major source of SPI is entergenous, and SPI would affect the prognosis of SAP patients. With the present therapeutic regimes it was hard to prevent entergenous infections. It is necessary to find a new strategy.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of vegetables and juices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the antibacterial activities of various fruit and vegetable extracts on common potential pathogens including antibiotic-resistant strains. METHODS: Standardized bacterial inocula were added to serial dilutions of sterile vegetable and fruit extracts in broth, with final bacterial concentrations of 10(4-5) cells/mL. After overnight incubation at 35 degrees C, antibacterial activity was measured by minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal dilutions (for raw juices) or concentrations (for tea). RESULTS: Among the vegetable and fruit extracts tested, all green vegetables showed no antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All purple and red vegetable and fruit juices had antibacterial activities in dilutions ranging from 1:2 to 1:16. Garlic juice had significant activity, with bactericidal action in dilutions ranging up to 1:128 of the original juice. Tea also had significant activity, with bactericidal action in concentrations ranging up to 1.6 mg/mL, against a spectrum of pathogens including resistant strains such as methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Tea and garlic have the potential for exploration of broader applications as antibacterial agents.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  - The neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. This enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. Its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. Most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media. The limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. The establishment of the gut microbial population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. The climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. The foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. Following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. The maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. The bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. After the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. In full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces the development of a flora rich in Bifidobacterium spp. Other obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. During the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. In other studies the presence of a consistent number of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. The predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. According to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. Environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. In these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of Bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. In extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. According to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Risk factors for the development of bacterial infections in multiple myeloma treated with two different vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone schedules.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We evaluated bacterial infections (BIs) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with two different schedules of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD). DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients were studied during 340 VAD cycles. VAD was given by either continuous intravenous infusion (CII) to hospitalized patients or rapid intravenous infusion (RII) to outpatients. The characteristics of patients and VAD schedules were retrospectively analyzed to detect correlations with the incidence of BI. RESULTS: By analyzing each VAD cycle, we found that profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.06) and post-treatment neutropenia (p=0.08) were associated with a trend for a higher risk of infection, while renal function impairment was significantly correlated with BI risk at both univariate (p<0.02) and multivariate (p<0.002) analyses. Evaluating only the first 4 months of therapy, characterized by a significantly higher incidence of BI than the later period (p<0.0001), previously untreated disease was significantly correlated with BI risk (p<0.04), while male sex (p=0.06), CII schedule (p=0.07), and profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.1) were associated with a tendency to a higher risk of infection; however, at multivariate analysis the latter two parameters independently predicted BI probability (p<0.015 and p<0.03, respectively) as did previously untreated disease (p<0.025). The high probability of CII-related infection was demonstrated to depend on the frequent development of nosocomial infections. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with profound hypogammaglobulinemia who receive VAD as first line treatment are at a major risk of BI up to the completion of the fourth month of therapy. In this setting hospitalization should be avoided and, if patients require admission, antibacterial prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulins could be appropriate and effective.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  - An agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. The catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. The catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. The efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (CS) catheters, CS catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (CS+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (MR) catheters and silver catheters against Staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis RIF-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. No significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. In both models, CS+ and MR catheters were effective against S. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas CS catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. CS+ catheters were effective against S. epidermidis RIF-r2, whereas MR catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. CS+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans in the agar model, whereas MR catheters were effective only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. The agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Antimicrobial proficiency testing of National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance  System hospital laboratories.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System personnel report trends in antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. To validate select antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and to identify test methods that tend to produce errors, we conducted proficiency testing among NNIS System hospital laboratories. SETTING: NNIS System hospital laboratories in the United States. METHODS: Each laboratory received five organisms (ie, an imipenem-resistant Serratia marcescens, an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, a vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus epidermidis, and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESbetaL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae). Testing results were compared with reference testing results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: Of 138 laboratories testing imipenem against the Serratia marcescens strain, 110 (80%) correctly reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) or zone sizes in the resistant range. All 193 participating laboratories correctly reported the Staphylococcus aureus strain as oxacillin resistant Of the 193 laboratories, 169 (88%) reported correct MICs or zone sizes for the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. One hundred sixty-two (84%) of 193 laboratories demonstrated the ability to detect a vancomycin-intermediate strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis, however, disk diffusion performed poorly when testing both staphylococci and enterococci with vancomycin. Although laboratory personnel correctly reported nonsusceptible extended-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam results for K. pneumoniae, only 98 (51%) of 193 correctly reported this organism as an ESbetaL producer. CONCLUSION: Overall, NNIS System hospital laboratory personnel detected most emerging resistance patterns. Disk diffusion continues to be unreliable for vancomycin testing of staphylococci and must be used cautiously for enterococci. Further education on the processing of ESbetaL-producing organisms is warranted.
TI  - Comparison of the bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against  Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - In addition to MIC and MBC tests in this study the serum bactericidal activity of 3.1 microg/ml of moxifloxacin or 5.2 microg/ml of levofloxacin was determined against ten susceptible strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Moxifloxacin achieved markedly better activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis as compared to levofloxacin. Activity of moxifloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae was excellent but not superior to levofloxacin. In conclusion both fluorquinolones are highly effective against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, moxifloxacin being superior with respect to gram-positives like S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - [Biological importance of the anti-carnosine activity of bacteria].
AB  - The anticarnosine activity has been found to be widely spread among bacteria, the degree of its manifestation depending on the source of isolation. The fact that anticarnosine activity plays a certain role in the phenomenon of persistence has been proved on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in rats.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - [Pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
AB  - We contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. The results were that the Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was 43.8% and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) was 56.2% in Group A (1985-1990); GPC was 24.6% and GNB was 75.4% in Group B (1995-2000). The predominant bacteria were in the following order: Preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in Group A; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in Group B. The results suggest that GNB is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
TI  - Prevalence and drug susceptibility of pathogens causing bloodstream infections in northern Italy: a two-year study in 16 hospitals.
AB  - The epidemiology of bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infection was studied in 16 hospitals in Lombardy (northern Italy) over a 2-year period (1999 and 2000). Overall, 2924 microorganisms causing significant bacteremia were collected. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli ( n=663; 22.7%), Staphylococcus aureus ( n=534; 18.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis ( n=242; 8.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=176; 6.0%). Unlike Escherichia coli, which was usually acquired from the community, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were usually acquired in hospitals. Rates of resistance to oxacillin and its associated traits were significantly higher among hospital-acquired staphylococci as compared to those of isolates from the community. Escherichia coli was highly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with a very low percentage of strains producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). On the contrary, production of ESBL appeared to be an important mechanism of resistance among nosocomial isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread in several members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with rates often exceeding 10%. Moreover, with regard to ciprofloxacin, there were no significant differences between rates of resistance among Enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-acquired infections versus those causing community-acquired infections. Multidrug resistance was commonly observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the need for new antimicrobial agents that are more active against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, epidemiological studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of blood isolates in northern Italy appear to provide useful information for both empirical treatment of suspected infections and better management of patients.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria and analysis of their sensibility to antibiotics in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was explore the distribution of the bacteria and their sensibility to antibiotics in hospital-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-six bacterium species were collected in patients with the hospital-acquired pneumonia to make sputum culture. The sensibility of the bacteria to antibiotics were examined by KB paper method and the minimal-inhibitory-concentration by gel double multiple dilute method. RESULTS: Most of the G- bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%) and klebsiella bacillus (22%). Most of the G+ bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis (14%) and staphylococcus aureus (12%). G- bacteria were sensitive to impienem(98%), cefoperazone(90%), ceftriaxone(90%), leftazidime(92%), ciprofloxacin(90%), and amikacin(89%). The sensibility of vancomycin to G+ bacteria was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella bacillus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus are the most important bacteria in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Imipenem, cefoperazone, ceftriazone, leftazidime, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and vancomycin are effective antibiotics for treating hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Physicochemical characterization and antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 47T2 NCBIM 40044.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa 47T2, grown in submerged culture with waste frying oil as  a carbon source, produced a mixture of rhamnolipids with surface activity. Up to 11 rhamnolipid homologs (Rha-Rha-C(8)-C(10); Rha-C(10)-C(8)/Rha-C(8)-C(10);Rha-Rha-C(8)-C(12:1); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(12:1); Rha-C(10)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(12)/Rha-Rha-C(12)-C(10); Rha-C(10)-C(12:1)/Rha-C(12:1)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(12:1)-C(12); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(14:1); Rha-C(10)-C(12)/Rha-C(12)-C(10)) were isolated from cultures of P. aeruginosa 47T2 from waste frying oil and identified by HPLC-MS analysis. This article deals with the production, isolation, and chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid mixture RL(47T2). The physicochemical and biological properties of RL(47T2) as a new product were also studied. Its surface tension decreased to 32.8 mN/m; and the interfacial tension against kerosene to 1 mN/m. The critical micellar concentration for RL(47T2) was 108.8 mg/mL. The product showed excellent antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated according to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits development of visible microbial growth. Low MIC values were found for bacteria Serratia marcescens (4 microg/mL), Enterobacter aerogenes (8 microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.5 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 microg/mL), Bacillus subtilis (16 microg/mL), and phytopathogenic fungal species: Chaetonium globosum (64 microg/mL), Penicillium funiculosum (16 microg/mL), Gliocadium virens (32 microg/mL) and Fusarium solani (75 microg/mL).
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - [Survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Epidemiology of neonatal meningitis in Qatar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonatal meningitis is responsible for thousands of neonatal deaths annually all over the world. Our study was conducted to determine the epidemiology, management and best preventive measures for neonatal meningitis in Qatar. METHODS: A retrospective study reviewed the records of bacterial meningitis patients under the age of one month. The study was carried out at Hamad Medical Hospital, the only hospital that provides health care at Qatar and the study period was between January 1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Sixty percent of patients had early onset meningitis. Causative organisms were group B Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas species, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Flavibacterium meningococcus septicum. A bacterial resistance to the usual combination of ampicillin and gentamicin were noticed (as initial treatment before culture sensitivity results), which affected negatively on some patients. Complications of cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy occurred in 3 patients (23%). None of the patients died during the study period. CONCLUSION: Emphasis is placed on the importance of correct early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy. It is suggested that the identification and appropriate treatment of any maternal bacterial infection is an important measure in preventing neonatal sepsis and meningitis.

TI  - Purification of lactoperoxidase from creek-water buffalo milk and investigation of kinetic and antibacterial properties.
AB  - Water buffalo lactoperoxidase (WBLP) was purified with Amberlite CG 50 H+ resin,  CM Sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. All purification steps of the WBLP were shown with SDS-PAGE and Rz (A412/A280) controlled the purification degree of the enzyme. Rz value for the purified WBLP was 0.8. To determine purification steps and kinetic properties, the activity of enzyme was measured by using 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH=6. Km, Vmax, optimum pH, and optimum temperature for the WBLP were found by means of graphics for ABTS as substrates. Optimum pH and optimum temperature of the WBLP were 6 and 60 degrees C, respectively. Km value at optimum pH and optimum temperature for the WBLP was 0.82 mM. Vmax value at optimum pH and optimum temperature was 13.7 micromol/mL x min. Km value at optimum pH and 25 degrees C for the WBLP was 0.77 mM. Vmax value at optimum pH and 25 degrees C was 4.83 micromol/mL x min. The purified WBLP was found to have high antibacterial activity in a thiocynate-H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginose, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus saphrophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Shigella dysenteriae and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as tetracycline, penicillin, and netilmicine.
TI  - [Studies on pyridonecarboxylic acids as antibacterial agents. XIV. Synthesis and  structure-activity relationships of 7,8-disubstituted-1-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinoline carboxylic acids].
AB  - Eighteen pyridonecarboxylic acids, characterized by a methyl group at the C6-position instead of the usual fluorine atom, cyclopropyl at the N1-position, substituted amino groups at the C7-position, and some substituted groups (hydrogen, chlorine, nitro and amino) at the C8-position, were synthesized. The in vitro antibacterial activity of these compounds were tested, and the structure-activity relationships were also discussed. The results of the study showed that the activity of compounds 22 and 24 were less potent than that of ciprofloxacin against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, while they were 2-100 times more potent than ciprofloxacin against K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, A. calcoacetous, E. aerogenes, S. typhi and S. typhimurium.
TI  - Prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections in 14 Greek hospitals: planning  from the local to the national surveillance level.
AB  - A prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) was carried out in 14 of 112 Greek hospitals (15.7%), scattered throughout Greece. Five of seven Greek university hospitals and nine regional hospitals participated in the one-day study, and 3925 hospitalized patients (10.5% of the total hospital beds in Greece) were recorded. The aim of this project was to organize a surveillance of HAI with the participation of the greatest possible number of Greek hospitals, transferring the experience from the local Cretan infection control network in an effort to create a nationwide network. Special attention was paid to recruit all Greek university hospitals in our attempt to expand the study base. Co-ordination of the participating centres, education of the infection control teams on surveillance methods, preparation of agreed definitions, and elaboration of the protocol for the collection of the data were the major objectives of this study. The difficulties, however, were limited resources and the lack of skilled personnel. The overall prevalence of HAI was found to be 9.3%. The most common HAI recorded involved lower respiratory tract infections (30.3%), followed by urinary tract infections (22.7%), bloodstream infections (15.8%), and surgical site infections (14.8%). The greatest prevalence rate was found in the adult ICU (48.4%), followed by the neonatal ICU (30.3%). The duration of hospitalization, the number of operations, the total number of used devices and invasive procedures were significantly correlated with HAI. Positive cultures were found in 51.5% of the cases. The most frequently isolated micro-organisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%), Escherichia coli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.6%). The administration of antibiotics was also recorded. The prevalence of antibiotic use was 51.4%.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients: practical problems and rational solutions.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection in children, and is  often fatal. Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness. Viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia; infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with Gram-negative organisms. An increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. Distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult; diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiological findings, and microbiological results. Recommended empiric therapy should consider factors such as the time of onset of illness, severity of disease, and specific risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, including use of mechanical ventilation, underlying disease, or recent use of antibacterials. The resident local hospital flora should be considered when selecting therapy for nosocomial pneumonia. Early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. For empiric treatment of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia, an intravenous antibacterial regimen that includes coverage of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive organisms should be used. A carbapenem or ureidopenicillin derivative (piperacillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor should be used where extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are endemic. Therapy should be modified when a specific pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility are identified. Effective prevention of nosocomial pneumonia requires infection control measures that affect the environment, personnel, and patients. Of these, hand hygiene, appropriate infection control policies, and judicious use of antibacterials are essential.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. METHODS: In all, 49 different isolates were studied. Each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. Plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 values, r=0.9. Gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 than Gram-positive bacteria. Group G streptococci (GGS) induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group A streptococci (GAS). Klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. GGS induced higher levels of IL-6 than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. When the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. CONCLUSION: Species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - Low frequency of bacteraemia during eye surgery obviates the need for endocarditis prophylaxis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of bacteraemia following eye surgery, and thereby evaluate the need for antibiotic cover during such procedures, in patients who are at risk for bacterial endocarditis. METHODS: This prospective study involved 50 consecutive patients undergoing extraocular surgery at the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. Local preparation of the surgical site in all patients included pre-operative instillation of 0.3% gentamicin and 3% povidone-iodine eye drops. Two eye swabs (one from the conjunctival sac and another from the eyelid margin) and two venous blood samples (one taken just before the procedure and the second 10 min into it) were collected and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Surgery-related bacteraemia was defined as a negative pre-operative blood culture followed by a positive intraoperative blood culture of the same bacterium identified in the positive eye swab. RESULTS: Only two patients (4%) demonstrated surgery-related bacteraemia: one caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis (following entropion correction) and the other by Haemophilus influenzae (following dacryocystorhinostomy). Four other patients had positive conjunctival swabs without bacteraemia, the causative organisms being Haemophilus influenzae in two, and Staphyloccus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one each. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic surgery is not associated with significant bacteraemia, and therefore does not mandate routine antibiotic cover in patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis. Stringent pre-operative preparation of the surgical site may suffice to minimise bacteraemia; however, this requires further study.
TI  - Grazing rates of diverse morphotypes of bacterivorous ciliates feeding on four allochthonous bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The permanence in aquatic systems of allochthonous bacteria coming from sewage effluents is a risk for public health. This work aimed to analyse the elimination of the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by a riverine ciliate community. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ciliates were characterized and identified on the basis of morphological and behavioural features and grouped in nine morphotypes. Differential grazing by each morphotype on the four allochthonous bacteria was carried out by adding fluorescently labelled bacteria to the water samples, and measuring their uptake along time. CONCLUSIONS: The nine morphotypes were present in all the samples but in different proportions, being the most abundant the small scuticociliates and hipotrichs. The smallest morphotypes showed grazing rates lower than 20 FLB ciliate(-1) h(-1), with a preference towards K. pneumoniae. The larger morphotypes showed in general the highest grazing rates, but the selectivity was hardly attributable to bacterial size or type of cell wall. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The elimination of allochthonous bacteria in an aquatic system may be highly different depending on the diversity of the ciliated protistan community in the system and on the nature of the bacterial prey.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Etiology and microbiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in newborns].
AB  - A comparative analysis of the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) among premature infants in intensive care units and premature infant nurseries in 1994 (group I) and 1999 (group II) is presented. It was shown that the number of the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the premature infants of group. I was 2,4 times higher than that in the group II (45.8 and 19.2 per cent respectively). A marked difference in the species pattern of the pathogens isolated from the endobronchial aspirate in 1994 and 1999 was observed. The species pattern of the isolates from the respiratory tract (Pseudomonas aeruginosa--40 per cent; Klebsiella pneumoniae--31 per cent; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus--rare) showed that the pneumonia were nosocomial. The revealed similarity of the species patterns of the microflora in various parts of the respiratory tract and the throat posterior wall made it possible to consider the isolates of the throat posterior wall as a relative guide for confirming the etiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - Samioside, a new phenylethanoid glycoside with free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities from Phlomis samia.
AB  - A new phenylethanoid glycoside, samioside, was isolated from the aerial parts of  Phlomis samia and identified as 1-O-3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4-O-caffeoyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside (1). In addition, one known phenylethanoid glycoside and three known flavonoids were identified as acteoside (2), apigenin, chrysoeriol, and ermanin, respectively. The structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of its spectroscopic data. Samioside (1) demonstrated scavenging properties toward the DPPH radical and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Method for studying development of colonization and infection of dialysis catheters.
AB  - Microbial colonization and infection of dialysis catheters is the major cause of  catheter failure. The present study aimed to develop a method to permit the study of microbial biofilm formation and antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy. Standard silicon rubber and silver-impregnated catheters were sectioned into 1 mm slices and placed into 1-cm x 2-cm culture slide chambers. Fresh clinical isolates were obtained from infected patients and suspended in concentrations of 10(3), 10(6), and 10(9) colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter in a variety of liquid suspending culture media, which included serum protein constituents. Antibiotics could be added to the suspending fluid to determine prophylactic activity, or at any time thereafter to determine therapeutic activity. The catheter sections were incubated with the microbial challenge for 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours and then washed in flowing distilled water to remove unattached biofilm. They were then stained with acridine orange, which fluoresces microbial DNA, and were examined by confocal scanning laser microscopy. Biofilm formation, representing colonization and infection, were quantified by comparing the fluorescent pixel analysis of the uninoculated control with the challenged catheter. The method was reproducible and permitted quantitative analysis. Standard silicon rubber catheters demonstrated greater biofilm formation than silver-impregnated catheters. The method examines the factors involved in microbial colonization and infection, and in antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy.
TI  - Multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  - Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of death in ICUs, especially affecting septic patients. It is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. The prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. The objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital ICU related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of MOF, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. The mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. The main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. A retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the ICU in a 4 month period during 1999. Fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by ACCS/SCCM criteria. There were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency patients). APACHE II score was calculated on admission and MOF, measured for the first five days, was diagnosed using Marshall and Meakins criteria. The statistical method used was non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). Thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. Death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). None of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%), died. There were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. The most frequent bacteria found were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (2). The mean value +/- SD of APACHE II (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). We conclude that MOF due to sepsis in an ICU is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high APACHE II.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two Cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (A and B) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. The nine strains of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. Results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon B leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the B leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both K. pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. Cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. The MICs of cinnamaldehyde against the E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and V. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - [A molecular and epidemiology study in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate causative agents in patients with ventilator-associated (VA) pneumonia epidemiologically, then to provide useful suggestion for diagnosis and treatment of VA pneumonia. METHOD: Prospectively, a protected specimens brush was used to obtain the secretion of lower respiratory tract of 65 patients, who had been receiving mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy for more than 72 hours. At the same time, other samples were collected from the relevant places, including pharyngeal and gastric juice of patients as well as other persons, ward's air. The secretion obtained were cultured with a quantitative method. Then all bacteria isolated were studied with the analysis of pattern of plasmids and chromosomal restriction endonuclease. RESULT: It was showed that the route of infection of the Gram-negative bacilli in VA pneumonia (19 cases) was intrinsic, a retrograde colonization from patient's stomach, that was the pattern of clonization from stomach to pharynx, then into lower respiratory tract, and the Gram-positive staphylococcus spread mainly through the ward's air, then directly into lower respiratory tract, or extrinsic (20 cases). CONCLUSION: The Gram-positive staphylococcus is also major disease-producing germs in VA pneumonia, and the infection routes of G+ and G- bacteria might be different.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - Increase of Enterobacter in neonatal sepsis: a twenty-two-year study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the incidence of Enterobacter infections in neonates over prolonged periods of time are scant. We determined the epidemiology of Enterobacter sepsis and/or meningitis and the trends of infection in a neonatal unit. METHODS: Retrospective review of sepsis and/or meningitis in inborn neonates admitted to Son Dureta University Hospital during a 22-year period. Molecular study by ribotyping of the Enterobacter strains isolated from 1995 to 1997. RESULTS: There were 513 cases of culture-proved sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates. In late onset infections Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequent isolates in the period 1977 through 1991. Enterobacter was the most common isolate in the period 1992 through 1998. During this latter period Candida infections also increased, and the resistance rate of Enterobacter to cefotaxime was higher (59.2%). Decrease in early onset infections and increase in late onsets (4.6/1,000 live births) were observed in the second period. From 1977 to 1998, 45 episodes of sepsis and/or meningitis by Enterobacter species were identified in 44 patients (8.7% of all neonatal bacteremias). Three patients with Enterobacter bacteremia died (6.6%, 0.03/1,000 live births). During 1995 through 1997 5 different clones causing sepsis were identified and 3 were predominant. In 1997 there was an outbreak of Enterobacter disease. After cleaning, cohort nursing and hygiene reinforcement, Enterobacter was not isolated in the next 2 years. No change in the antibiotic policy was made. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a resurgence of Enterobacter infections in our neonatal intensive care unit. The sudden disappearance of this microorganism after reinforcement of hygienic measures, without withdrawing cefotaxime, confirms the importance of patient-to-patient transmission of this nosocomial infection. Further studies are needed to establish the role of antibiotics in the emergence of microorganisms in neonatal intensive care units.
TI  - Activity of plant flavonoids against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Thirty eight plant-derived flavonoids representing seven different structural groups were tested for activities against antibiotic-resistant bacteria using the disc-diffusion assay and broth dilution assay. Among the flavonoids examined, four flavonols (myricetin, datiscetin, kaempferol and quercetin) and two -flavones (flavone and luteolin) exhibited inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Myricetin was also found to inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant Burkholderia -cepacia, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and other medically important organisms such as -Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Myricetin was bactericidal to B. cepacia. The results of the radiolabel incorporation assay showed that myricetin inhibited protein synthesis by -B. cepacia. The structure-activity relationship of these flavonoids is discussed.
TI  - Mechanisms of biofilm resistance to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Biofilms are communities of microorganisms attached to a surface. It has become clear that biofilm-grown cells express properties distinct from planktonic cells, one of which is an increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. Recent work has indicated that slow growth and/or induction of an rpoS-mediated stress response could contribute to biocide resistance. The physical and/or chemical structure of exopolysaccharides or other aspects of biofilm architecture could also confer resistance by exclusion of biocides from the bacterial community. Finally, biofilm-grown bacteria might develop a biofilm-specific biocide-resistant phenotype. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the biofilm, it is likely that there are multiple resistance mechanisms at work within a single community. Recent research has begun to shed light on how and why surface-attached microbial communities develop resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports from Europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on Day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. To assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) CFU/mL) by day of storage. RESULTS: All examples of B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL by Day 3 after inoculation. By Day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) CFU per mL. Units contaminated with S. epidermidis showed slower and more varied growth. By Day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) CFU per mL. By Day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL. CONCLUSION: These experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) CFU per mL on Day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. It would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Activity of cecropin P1 and FA-LL-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  - Two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, FA-LL-37 and cecropin P1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five Lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. Both peptides inhibited Escherichia coli at 25 microM (FA-LL-39), and 1.56 microM (cecropin P1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microM, and 25 microM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microM, and 1.56 microM), but not Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. FA-LL-37 acted bacteriocidally against E. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two Gram-negative organisms. Cecropin P1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. Lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate Lactobacillus fermentum B-54, which was susceptible to FA-LL-37 at 100 microM. The differential activities of these peptides toward Gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. In addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 9-O-acyl- and 9-O-benzoyl-substituted berberrubines.
AB  - In the course of a structure-activity relationship study on berberrubine derivatives, a series of compounds bearing 9-O-acyl-(4-6) and 9-O-benzoyl- (7) substituents was synthesized with the expectation of increasing the antimicrobial activity. One of the berberrubine derivatives, 9-lauroylberberrubine chloride was the most active against Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison to berberine, the currently used antibiotic in clinic. This result suggested that the presence of lipophilic substituents of certain structures and sizes might be crucial for the optimal antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Monitoring of two intravenous immunoglobulin. Preparations for immunoglobulin G subclasses and specific antibodies to bacterial surface antigens and relation with their levels in treated immunodeficient patients.
AB  - Patients with antibody deficiency disorders are highly susceptible to bacterial infections. Replacement therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG) has been established in such patients for two decades. The efficacy of IVIG treatment depends on the amount of functional pathogen-specific antibodies provided. The present study was undertaken to determine the levels of immunoglobulin classes, IgG subclasses, and specific antibodies to bacterial surface antigens in two different IVIG preparations (Sandoglobulin and Gamimmune) and blood sera of IVIG-treated immunodeficient patients. The levels of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgG subclasses were determined in both IVIG preparations and in patients' sera and were compared with those of healthy individuals. Sandoglobulin contained significantly higher concentrations of IgA, IgG, and IgG4 than Gamimmune. The latter contained higher concentrations of IgG1. Patients treated with Gamimmune) had significantly lower concentration of IgG4 as compared with healthy individuals and Sandoglobulin-treated patients. This finding was related to the preparation's composition. Screening of 20 lots from each preparation for antibodies to frequent clinically isolated strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococci spp. showed a high lot-to-lot variability. In order to overcome the lot-to-lot variability and correlate the observed effects with each IVIG preparation, the administered IVIG lots were selected so that their titers were in the interval of mean value +/- S.D. for each pathogen. The two tested preparations showed significant differences in their content of specific antibodies that ultimately affected the levels of these antibodies in treated patients. More specifically, Sandoglobulin contained higher levels of antibodies to E. coli and S. epidermidis strains. Infusion of this preparation maintained the respective antibodies in the recipients significantly higher than those of healthy individuals. Gamimmune infusion led to similar and comparable levels. Both IVIG preparations had comparable antibody titers towards K. pneumoniae, provided high amounts of antibodies, and kept recipients' specific IgG at levels significantly higher than those of the healthy individuals. Enterococci spp. specific antibodies were significantly higher in Gamimmune, whereas titers of antibodies towards S. aureus were comparable. Levels of antibodies against both Enterococci spp. and S. epidermidis after administration of both preparations were close to those in healthy individuals. None of the patients developed infection during the time of the study. In conclusion, most of the lots of the two IVIG preparations studied, despite some quantitative differences, provide patients with sufficient amounts of antibodies to bacterial surface antigens that protect them against infections.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis in a neonatal intensive care unit over a three-year period.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis, are increasingly important nosocomial pathogens, particularly in critically ill neonates. A 3-year prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was performed by traditional epidemiologic methods as well as molecular typing of microorganisms. The aims of the study were (i) to quantify the impact of S. epidermidis on NICU-acquired infections, (ii) to establish if these infections are caused by endemic clones or by incidentally occurring bacterial strains of this ubiquitous species, (iii) to evaluate the use of different methods for the epidemiologic typing of the isolates, and (iv) to characterize the occurrence and the spread of staphylococci with decreased glycopeptide susceptibility. Results confirmed that S. epidermidis is one of the leading causes of NICU-acquired infections and that the reduced glycopeptide susceptibility, if investigated by appropriate detection methods such as population analysis, is more common than is currently realized. Typing of isolates, which can be performed effectively through molecular techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis but not through antibiograms, showed that many of these infections are due to clonal dissemination and, thus, are potentially preventable by strict adherence to recommended infection control practices and the implementation of programs aimed toward the reduction of the unnecessary use of antibiotics. These strategies are also likely to have a significant impact on the frequency of the reduced susceptibility of staphylococci to glycopeptides, since this phenomenon appears to be determined either by more resistant clones transmitted from patient to patient or, to a lesser extent, by strains that become more resistant as a result of antibiotic pressure.
TI  - Neonatal Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis and imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  - Efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin in neonatal Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis was investigated in 45 infants compared to 39 control infants on conventional antibiotic regimen. Sensitivity to imipenem was 94% followed by cephoxitin (88%), quinolons (80%), and amikacin (52%) according to susceptibility results in the study group. Treatment duration of surviving infants was 16.5 +/- 4.6 and 20.3 +/- 6.4 days in the study and control groups respectively (p < 0.05). Five infants (11%) vs 27 (69%) were unresponsive (septic deaths) to treatment in the study and control groups respectively (p < 0.001). The cure rates were 73% and 28% respectively (p < 0.001). Sequelae free discharge rates were 67% and 23% respectively (p < 0.001). The most frequent adverse effects of imipenem/cilastatin were Candida albicans superinfection (20%); Candida albicans colonisation (10%); impairment of liver and renal functions (19% and 10% respectively); seizures (5%); thrombocytosis (3%); thrombophlebitis (3%); urine discoloration (3%); and Staphylococcus epidermidis colonisation (2%). Imipenem is considered a good alternative for neonatal Klebsiella pneumonia sepsis with these results, however, one must be aware of the increased risk of Candida albicans superinfection.
TI  - [Advantages and disadvantages in the use of central venous catheters in children  with malignant diseases].
AB  - The authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. During 1997 central venous catheter type Hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). The average time of catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). Gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken from the catheter and hemoculture. The central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine irrigation solution on contaminated bone-tendon allografts.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine an expedient and effective method for  disinfecting contaminated human bone-tendon allografts. The first part of this study used beef muscle and cadaveric human tissues to determine the most effective solution and volume to decontaminate tissues inoculated with four different organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the solutions tested (benzalkonium chloride, castile soap, castile soap followed by benzalkonium chloride, triple antibiotic, chlorhexidine gluconate, and chlorhexidine gluconate/triple antibiotic), only the 4% chlorhexidine power irrigation solution and 4% chlorhexidine/triple antibiotic bath completely disinfected all tissues. Work in part 2 revealed that a 2% chlorhexidine irrigation solution was equally effective as the 4% solutions. Part 3 of the study involved human Achilles tendon-calcaneus allografts. We found similar results: 3 liters of 2% chlorhexidine power irrigation solution thoroughly removed all microorganisms from the contaminated tissues. All control allografts irrigated with normal saline solution alone revealed positive bacterial growth for all four organisms after 72 hours' growth on sheep blood agar. Total decontamination time was 10 to 12 minutes. Two percent chlorhexidine irrigation solution may be an effective method for decontaminating human bone-tendon allografts challenged with a polymicrobial inoculum. This method of disinfecting bone-tendon allografts is at least five times more expeditious than methods in previously reported studies.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - Mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. Genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. In this study the binding of purified MBL to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. Diverse Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci exhibited strong binding of MBL, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. In contrast, beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. Bound MBL was able to promote C4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that MBL may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Specificity of antibodies to bacterial DNA in the sera of healthy human subjects  and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the epitope structure to DNA by identifying antigenic determinants on bacterial DNA bound by anti-DNA antibodies from normal human subjects (NHS) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Sera from NHS and patients with SLE were tested by ELISA for the presence of antibodies to single stranded DNA from calf thymus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium perfringens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To assess binding to conserved and nonconserved determinants, sera were absorbed on DNA-cellulose affinity columns bearing each of the bacterial DNA and then tested for binding to the other DNA antigens. RESULTS: Absorption of SLE sera with any of the bacterial DNA caused a loss of binding to all other bacterial DNA as well as calf thymus DNA. In contrast, absorption of NHS sera with bacterial DNA caused a loss of binding to the DNA on the affinity column with much less effect on binding to the other DNA antigens. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a marked difference in the specificity of antibodies to bacterial DNA in NHS and patients with SLE. The binding of SLE anti-DNA to predominantly conserved determinants suggests that a shift in patterns of anti-DNA specificity may be associated with the autoimmune state.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - Cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  - The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Prolonged leaching time of peptide antibiotics from acrylic bone cement.
AB  - The leaching time of antibiotics in growth inhibitory concentrations from polyacrylic bone cements was determined using Escherichia coli, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as target bacteria. The leaching time of the peptide antibiotics vancomycin and polymyxin B nonapeptide was considerably longer than that of gentamicin, novobiocin, and erythromycin. Among the nonpeptide antibiotics, the leaching time of novobiocin lasted longer than did that of gentamicin. The acylated parent polymyxin B antibiotic leached for a considerably shorter period than did the deacylated polymyxin B nonapeptide derivative, suggesting that the lipids impede the leaching process from the cement. Cement beads impregnated with polymyxin B nonapeptide and introduced into the tibia of three rabbits receiving oral novobiocin protected bone infection against a challenge of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that otherwise caused infection in tibias containing gentamicin impregnated cement beads. The peptide antibiotics alone or in combination with other antibiotics (polymyxin B nonapeptide and novobiocin) impregnated in cements for orthopaedic procedures may provide longer periods of protection against a wide range of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT antimicrobial barrier dressing.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing (Westaim Biomedical Corp, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada), a silver-coated wound dressing, and compared it with silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and mafenide acetate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), zone of inhibition, and killing curves were determined with 5 clinically relevant bacteria. The data indicate that ACTICOAT silver had the lowest MIC and MBC and generated similar zones of inhibition to silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine. Viable bacteria were undetectable 30 minutes after inoculation with the dressing, whereas it took 2 to 4 hours for silver nitrate and silver sulfadazine to achieve the same result. Mafenide acetate generated the biggest zones of inhibition, but it had the highest MICs and MBCs, and a significant number of bacteria still survived after 6 hours of treatment. The results suggest that ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing has better antimicrobial performance than either of the existing silver-based products. ACTICOAT dressing killed the bacteria that were tested much faster, which is a very important characteristic for a wound dressing acting as a barrier to invasive infection to have. The study also suggests that a single susceptibility test such as a MIC or zone of inhibition test does not provide a comprehensive profile of antimicrobial activity of a topical antimicrobial agent or dressing. A combination of tests is desirable.
TI  - Stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  - AIM: To serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. METHODS: Stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed. RESULTS: By day 30, predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterbacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. In breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (SE 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; Gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. On day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). Gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The gut of extremely low birthweight infants is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. Breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology as an effective tool in the surveillance of infections in  the neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: nosocomial infections result in considerable morbidity and mortality  in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the molecular epidemiology approach in the surveillance and control of infections in the NICU. METHODS: a 1-year prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections in a NICU was performed using traditional epidemiological methods as well as molecular typing of micro-organisms. RESULTS: the nosocomial infection rate among the 343 newborns was 24.8%. The risk of infection was associated with low birth weight, prolonged length of stay, empiric antibiotic treatment and nasopharyngeal colonization. Four pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were responsible for more than 80% of the infections. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) K. pneumoniae and MRSA infections constituted outbreaks caused by a single clone, whereas MRSE and MSSA infections did not represent outbreaks but rather a series of sporadic infections caused by different strains. CONCLUSIONS: molecular epidemiology techniques are powerful tools that can elucidate modes of spread and reservoirs of infection in the NICU and identify effective measures to control epidemic or endemic situations.
TI  - Interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a Lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  - The ability of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. A parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). Subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although the initial deposition rates of the two Candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
TI  - Is the limulus amebocyte lysate the sole predictor of septic episodes in major thermal injuries?
AB  - Septic episodes in thermal injuries are usually hallmarked by a series of physiologic parameters that include tachypnea, prolonged paralytic ileus, hyperthermia or hypothermia, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis or unexplained leukopenia, acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Recent studies with polycystic kidney disease have clearly indicated that the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assays were predictive of fungal infections in this patient population. Because both bacteria and fungi produce lipopolysaccharide that can be identified with the LAL assay, we randomly assayed sequential sera of 45 patients with major thermal injuries for positivity in the LAL assay, with use of the QCL-1000 kit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md). The average burn size of this patient population was 63.43% total body surface area. The average age of the patient was 6.2 years. The sex distribution included 30 males and 15 females. The infectious agents included gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, and 14 patients had concomitant fungal infections. Eighty-five percent of the patients tested were positive for endotoxin, with levels ranging from < 0.1 EU/mL to > 1.0 EU/mL. The predominant organism isolated before or on the date the serum was drawn was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (51%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15%). The remaining 34% were a variety of Enterobacteriaceae. Of the 14 patients who yielded a fungus, 3 had negative LAL assays. Two patients with an elevated LAL grew only Staphylococcus epidermidis in the bloodstream and the wounds. These data clearly indicate that the LAL assay cannot be relied on as the sole predictor of septic episodes; however, it can be an adjunctive test to confirm sepsis when the other parameters have been considered.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Elimination of intraluminal colonization by antibiotic lock in silicone vascular  catheters.
AB  - An in vitro model was designed to evaluate the efficacy of instilled antimicrobials to reduce or eliminate intraluminal microbial colonization. Minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration activity of appropriate test anti-infectives were determined using standard methodology against clinically derived and reference test strains commonly associated with catheter-related infection. Drug activity was validated by bioassay for the test anti-infectives. Reference and clinical test strains were inoculated to the intraluminal surface of silicone catheter segments and incubated for 30 min, after which the inoculum was replaced with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution and reincubated for 12 h. For 7 d, instillation of antibiotic and TPN solution was alternated every 12 h to simulate clinical conditions. On days 1, 4, and 7, catheter segments were rinsed, bisected, and sonicated for quantitative plate count to determine mean microbial counts per centimeter of catheter surface. Catheter segments were also prepared for scanning electron microscopy. A significant decrease in staphylococcal intraluminal colonization after instillation of nafcillin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and vancomycin was demonstrated (P < 0.001). Aztreonam, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin completely eliminated gram-negative catheter colonization (P < 0.001). Yeast was eradicated from the internal catheter surface after treatment with amphoteracin B, and fluconazole significantly decreased intraluminal colonization (P < 0.001). Results show a significant decrease in staphylococcal, gram-negative, and fungal intraluminal colonization after instillation of appropriate antimicrobial. In vitro results support early clinical success using this technique. Future studies are warranted to identify optimal drug concentrations and dosing intervals.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis after ampicillin therapy.
AB  - The bacteriologies of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were studied in 74 chronic sinusitis patients who took ampicillin (500 mg every 6 hours) for 2 weeks preoperatively. The specimens from one ipsilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were obtained when undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery. In 74 specimens of the maxillary sinus, 38 bacterial isolates were recovered. The culture rate was 46.0%. On the other hand, 34 bacterial isolates were taken from the ethmoid sinus specimens. The culture rate was 41.9%. As compared with a previous group who did not take any antibiotic preoperatively, the culture rate significantly decreased in the maxillary as well as the ethmoid sinus specimens. Not surprisingly, a significantly decreased sensitivity to ampicillin was also found in the recovered bacteria from both the maxillary sinus (23.7%) and ethmoid sinus (5.9%) specimens. These results demonstrate that antibiotic therapy with ampicillin could eradicate most sensitive bacteria in chronic sinusitis. However, persistence of resistant bacteria was demonstrated.
TI  - Septicaemia in paediatric cancer patients: a 5-year surveillance study in university hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
AB  - Infectious complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with malignancy. Empirical antimicrobial therapy in the management of fever of unknown origin should be tailored to local bacteriological data and antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Five-hundred-and-fifty-nine cases of culture-proven septicaemia occurring in pediatric cancer patients between 1990 and 1994 were retrospectively analysed and compared with a similar study done in our centre between 1976 and 1979. A wide spectrum of organisms was isolated. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common and consistent bacteria isolated during the 5 year period. More than 70 per cent of the staphylococci were sensitive to methicillin and universally sensitive to vancomycin. However, a worrying trend of ceftazidime-resistance amongst gram-negative organisms was found. In these situations, the use of imipenem is recommended as resistance to this antimicrobial agent was exceedingly rare.
TI  - A xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, Xanthium sibiricum Patr er Widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). By monitoring antibacterial activity against MRSA strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3aR-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against S. aureus species, including MRSA; its activity against MRSA and MSSA strains was similar. Other bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of S. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
TI  - Microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. The bacteria tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three fungal species also were tested: Aspergillus fumigatus, Paecilomyces variotii, and Candida albicans. In the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: K. pneumoniae, C. albicans, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. In the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. They were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. None of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. In contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: S. epidermidis, E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. Samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. Of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. In most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. In only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. The data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for extended periods of time.
TI  - Susceptibility of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant hospital bacteria to disinfectants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria  exhibited altered susceptibility to disinfectants. DESIGN: Antibiotic-susceptible bacteria were obtained from American Type Culture Collection: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria were obtained from clinical isolates, including: S aureus, S epidermidis, E coli, Enterococcus species, K pneumoniae, and P aeruginosa. The Association of Official Analytical Chemist's use-dilution method was used to test these 12 strains of 7 bacterial pathogens for their susceptibility to a phenol and a quaternary ammonium compound. For five pathogens, we tested a susceptible and a more resistant strain in 20 comparative trials (5 pathogens, 2 disinfectants, 2 dilutions per disinfectant). RESULTS: In our 20 comparative trials, the antibiotic-resistant strains exhibited an increased resistance to the disinfectant in only a single instance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the development of antibiotic resistance does not appear to be correlated to increased resistance to disinfectants.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates by use of a novel psoralen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A photochemical treatment process has been developed for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates. This process is based on the photochemical reaction of a novel psoralen, S-59, with nucleic acids upon illumination with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High levels of pathogens were added to single-donor platelet concentrates containing 3 to 5 x 10(11) platelets in 300 mL of 35-percent autologous plasma and 65-percent platelet additive solution. After treatment with S-59 (150 microM) and UVA (0-3 J/cm2), the infectivity of each pathogen was measured with established biologic assays. In vitro platelet function after photochemical treatment was evaluated during 7 days of storage by using a panel of 14 assays. The in vivo recovery and life span of photochemically treated platelets were evaluated after 24 hours of storage in a primate transfusion model. RESULTS: The following levels of pathogen inactivation were achieved: >10(6.7) plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL of cell-free human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), >10(6.6) PFU per mL of cell-associated HIV, >10(6.8) infectious dose (ID50) per mL of duck hepatitis B virus (a model for hepatitis B virus), >10(6.5) PFU per mL of bovine viral diarrhea virus (a model for hepatitis C virus), >10(6.6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and >10(5.6) colony-forming units of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Expression of integrated HIV was inhibited by 0.1 microM S-59 and 1 J per cm2 of UVA. In vitro and in vivo platelet function were adequately maintained after antiviral and antibacterial treatment. CONCLUSION: Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates offers the potential for reducing transfusion-related viral and bacterial diseases.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens in neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - A total of 256 swabs taken from different areas of neonatal intensive care units  (ICU) in KCG Hospital and AMC Hospital, Bangalore were bacteriologically investigated for prevalence, source and spread of nosocomial bacteria. Culture studies revealed growth in 217 (84.8%) swab samples indicating considerable contamination of different areas of the units and sources of infection. Klebsiella pneumoniae (27.3%) was the predominant organism followed by Esch coli (16.8%), Staph aureus (11.7%), Staph epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.2%), enterococcus and proteus (4.7%), Citrobacter freundi (3.5%) and Clostridium tetani (2.4%) isolated from the equipment, cradles, other inanimate objects and environmental surfaces. Out of 312 isolates, monobacterial prevalence was 43.6% in contrast to polybacterial prevalence of 56.4%. Klebsiella pneumoniae (74.3%) was the predominant monobacterial isolate. The indoor air of the units was found to carry common nosocomial bacteria of 4 or more different bacterial species at dangerous levels as observed by colony counts of 15 to 30 on exposed blood agar plates. Almost all sources in ICU revealed the presence of Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Esch coli, pseudomonas and staphylococcus thus forming the potential reservoirs of nosocomial infections to babies and this could be attributed to overcrowding, poor ventilation system and failure to follow basic principles of strict protective barrier nursing.
TI  - Bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - This study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. The anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. Then, the sample of ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. Thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. Fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. The cultural rate was 60.9%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus viridans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae. Conversely, only three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. The results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus more accurate.
TI  - Rapid identification of bacterially contaminated platelets using reagent strips:  glucose and pH analysis as markers of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One in every 1000 units of platelets is bacterially contaminated, which puts patients at risk for transfusion-associated sepsis and death. However, there is currently no screening test in place to detect contaminated units. The use of commercially available multiple-reagent urine dipsticks for this purpose was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelet concentrates were inoculated with either sterile saline or suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Serratia marcescens to a final concentration of 50 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. The platelets were analyzed daily by the use of multiple-reagent strips, quantitative culture, and glucometry. RESULTS: B cereus grew rapidly, reaching 10(7) CFU per mL 1 day after inoculation, while S. epidermidis grew slowly, achieving similar concentration 4 to 6 days after inoculation. Two of 10 dipstick reagents, glucose and pH, proved useful in detecting bacteria. Both were lower in bacterially contaminated units than in controls. Glucose data obtained from automated analyzers validated the dipstick data. All organisms were detected at concentrations > or = 10(7) CFU per mL, and S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were detected in the range of 10(3) to 10(5) CFU per mL. CONCLUSION: The multiple-reagent test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent (> or = 10(7) CFU/mL) and 98 to 100 percent, respectively. These data indicate that urine dipsticks can be used to rapidly and inexpensively detect bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates, which potentially will reduce morbidity and mortality at minimal cost.
TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  - Risk of microbial contamination with multiple use of 5-fluorouracil vials.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. METHODS: Ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5-FU were determined for each organism. Organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-FU (50 mg/ml) and, after timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees C. Plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. RESULTS: The MICs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-FU used by some clinics. After incubation in 5-FU for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis-were still viable. CONCLUSION: 5-FU has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-FU vials are used in multiple dose fashion.
TI  - [Sepsis in the very low-birth-weight newborn infant].
AB  - Sepsis is a common pathology during the neonatal period. Low-birth weight is the  most important isolated risk factor. With the purpose of determining the prevalence of nosocomial infection in newborns of very low birth weight (VLBW), finding the microbial flora and the mortality of these patients, the authors retrospectively analysed the clinical processes of the hospitalized VLBW in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in S. Joao Hospital in 1993 and 1994. Of the 1091 newborns admitted to the hospital in these two years, 112 were VLBW (10%). Of these, 48 had sepsis-31 (28%) confirmed sepsis and 17 (15%) probable sepsis. The agents most commonly found were Staphylococcus epidermidis (44%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%). Thirteen patients (27%) died, with infection as the cause of death in nine (19%). Our results confirm the importance of nosocomial neonatal infection, which should involve the strict observance of the asepsis norms and a proper policy of antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis.

Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.

Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Bacterial changes in neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - Organisms routinely cultured from throat swabs and infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis were reviewed. During the last 12 years, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli have been replaced by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the predominant isolates from throat swabs after admission. These change in the etiologic pattern of infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis, i.e., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, were in agreement with the organisms isolated from the throat swabs after admission. The S. aureus isolated from throat swabs after admission showed a decrease in the bacterial activity of cloxacillin, cephazolin and cefotaxime since 1978.
TI  - Bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit secondary to Enterococcus fecalis.
AB  - Bacteremia is often a serious and recurring problem in children with hemodialysis catheters. We report an outbreak of Enterococcus bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit occurring from June 1992 to June 1993. During this period, 18 episodes of bacteremia occurred in eight children; 11 infections were polymicrobial. Enterococcus fecalis was associated with 13 infections in five patients (8 polymicrobial). Other pathogens included Enterobacter cloacae (5 infections), Staphylococcus (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). All Enterococcus infections occurred in patients with dual-lumen subclavian venous catheters. Skin and catheter sites were culture negative, except in one patient. Rectal swabs were positive for Enterococcus in five patients. Enterococcus was not isolated from any source within the unit. Serotypes of all Enterococcus isolates were different, except for 2 isolates in the same patient. Starting in June 1993, catheters were flushed after dialysis with vancomycin or ampicillin. Since initiating this procedure, further episodes of Enterococcus bacteremia have not occurred. A questionnaire sent to other pediatric hemodialysis units failed to identify Enterococcus among 26 cases of bacteremia. IN CONCLUSION: (1) Enterococcus is an unusual pathogen for hemodialysis-related bacteremia in children; (2) patients with dialysis catheters were predisposed to this infection; (3) a common source for Enterococcus could not be identified by either culture or by serotyping; (4) flushing catheters with antibiotics after dialysis was effective prevention.
TI  - Hepatic abscesses in dogs: 14 cases (1982-1994).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine typical clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with hepatic abscesses, to assess outcome of treatment, and to evaluate the role that abdominal ultrasonography has in the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses in dogs and in monitoring response to treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. ANIMALS: 14 dogs with hepatic abscesses. RESULTS: Anorexia and lethargy were the most common historical complaints, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Physical abnormalities included fever, dehydration, signs of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and mucosal bleeding. Hematologic abnormalities included leukocytosis with neutrophilia, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and mild anemia. Serum biochemical abnormalities included high alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase activities and high bilirubin concentration; hypoalbuminemia and prolonged coagulation values were also reported. Abdominal radiography revealed hepatomegaly, poor abdominal detail, a hepatic mass, or splenomegaly in 9 dogs. Thoracic radiography revealed alveolar consolidation or mixed bronchial/interstitial pulmonary patterns in 6 dogs. Hypoechoic, heteroechoic, or hyperechoic masses were identified in all dogs in which ultrasonography was performed. Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus sp, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S intermedius were the most common bacteria isolated from hepatic abscesses. Concurrent infections were identified in the biliary tract, spleen, blood, endocardium, lung, prostate gland, peritoneum, lymph nodes, salivary gland, or brain of several dogs. Seven dogs died or were euthanatized before definitive treatment could be initiated. One dog was successfully treated with antibiotics and was alive 12 months after medical treatment. Six dogs were treated surgically (ie, full or partial liver lobectomy, drainage, abdominal lavage) and medically (ie, antibiotic administration). Five of these dogs survived and were alive 12 months after surgery. Ultrasonography was used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Hepatic abscesses are rare in dogs, but the clinical signs and clinicopathologic findings are similar to other inflammatory hepatic disease. Ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in all animals in which imaging studies were performed, and was successfully used to monitor response to treatment in several dogs. Medical and surgical treatments were used successfully to treat hepatic abscesses in dogs.
TI  - [Antibioticograms of microorganisms isolated from foci of local infections in infants].
AB  - Microbiological tests were performed in regard to 474 newborns within 1985-1995.  It was shown that gram-positive microflora (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus) predominated in the etiological structure of omphalitis and conjunctivitis. Among gram-negative isolates in the cases with omphalitis there predominated Klebsiella pneumonia. The antibioticograms were of great practical value for the adequate therapy.

TI  - A randomised comparison of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of bacterial  infections in paediatric patients.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of isepamicin 7.5 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or amikacin the same dosage regimen for the treatment of various infections in neutropenic and non-neutropenic paediatric patients were compared in a prospective randomised trial. In total, 306 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of randomised treatment (204 isepamicin, 102 amikacin: intent-to-treat population); 181 patients satisfied all criteria for evaluability (120 isepamicin, 61 amikacin: efficacy population). Clinical cure or improvement rates in the isepamicin and amikacin groups were: intent-to-treat population, 188/204 (92%) and 94/102 (92%), respectively; efficacy population, 117/120 (98%) and 58/61 (95%), respectively. The bacteriological elimination rate (efficacy population) in the isepamicin and amikacin treatment groups was 75/76 (99%) vs 35/38 (92%). Nephrotoxicity, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or > or = 44.2 mumol/L from baseline, occurred in 4/187 (2%) and 1/191 (1%) children treated with isepamicin and amikacin, respectively. Definite ototoxicity at the > or = 20 dB threshold occurred in 3 (1 isepamicin and 2 amikacin) out of 56 children evaluated with at least two audiograms. Thus isepamicin was as effective and as well tolerated as amikacin in the treatment of various infections in paediatric patients.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Bacteria in surface infections of neonates.
AB  - A bacteriological work on surface infections was done among live births (study group I) and neonates admitted in hospital (study group II). Out of 134 cases of conjunctivitis in group I Gram-negative bacilli predominated (48.5%) with Escherichia coli accounting for 29 (14.9%) cases, Klebsiella species 15 (11.2%) cases, Citrobacter freundii 3 (2.2%) cases, Pseudomons aeruginosa 18 (13.4%) cases and Aeromonas hydrophila 3 (2.2%) amongst pure isolates (73.9%). Gonococcus was noted in 2 (1.5%) cases. In group II, 41.7% were Staphylococcus aureus in pure growth (75%), compared to only 9.0% in group I. Skin infections were caused by both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the principal insolates from umbilical sepsis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated as pure growth from local site of noma neonatorum. Anaerobic cultures were negative in all except in 2 cases of umbilical sepsis with tetanus neonatorum revealing Clostridium tetani which however proved to be non-toxigenic. Blood cultures were positive in 4 out of 14 cases bearing 50% correlation with bacteria from surface infections. A source study established partial correlation with the cases of pseudomonas conjunctivitis. Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus and biochemical typing failed to detect any definite marker of clinical entities, except that the skin infections were caused by group III phages predominantly (65.0%).
TI  - The potential reduction of microbial contamination of central venous catheters.
AB  - The microbial contamination of stopcock entry ports attached to central venous catheters (CVC) was determined using a specially designed swab. The swab was made of a highly porous material, Porex, and was designed to fit exactly into the entry port of stopcocks. The swab was used to determine the frequency of microbial contamination of entry ports attached to CVC in patients located on an Intensive Care Unit. Of the 200 swabs obtained 44 (22%) contained microorganisms. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered from 43 of the swabs and diphtheroid bacilli from 1 swab. In vitro studies were carried out to investigate the efficiency of the swab in removing excess residual fluid and organisms from entry ports. The swab absorbed relatively large numbers of bacteria within seconds. When entry ports were inoculated with between 10(3) and 10(5) cfu of either Staphylococcus epidermidis or Klebsiella pneumoniae greater than 99% of the organisms were absorbed by the swab (P < 0.01). The absorbent swab was more efficient at removing S. epidermidis from the entry port when compared to a standard cotton swab (P < 0.01). In vitro this absorbent swab reduced the potential for catheter contamination resulting from migration of organisms from the entry port via the intraluminal route. The use of the swab in the clinical situation may reduce the incidence of CVC-related infections.
TI  - Biological activities of a Turkish medicinal plant, Prangos platychlaena.
AB  - Prangos platychlaena has been used in traditional medicine in eastern Turkey. It  stops bleeding and heals the scars when applied externally. When the isolated coumarins were tested against bacterial strains, only a slight activity was obtained.
TI  - A prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. We tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with IC than from control women. METHODS: Urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 IC patients and 7 control subjects. These specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. In addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Cultures of urine from 6 of 11 IC patients grew five different bacteria (Corynebacterium sp. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or Torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (Lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. Although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of IC patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (P < 0.05). Acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 IC patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens that grew Torulopsis. Additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 IC patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of 1 control patient. Biopsy specimens from 2 IC patients grew Torulopsis sp or Lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of Pseudomonas sp or Staphylococcus epidermidis, but no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. All other cultures and stains were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not provide evidence that IC is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. However, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of IC patients than of control subjects. If these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of IC should be addressed.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - Microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (Colocynthis citrullus L.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  - Microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. polymyxa, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, La. brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Micrococcus and Candida spp. The rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis.
TI  - Differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  - The short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. In addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. The results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. On the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. Escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while Aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. This different order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. Thus, the low digestion rates of Ent. faecalis and Staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric Gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.
TI  - Negative catheter-tip culture and diagnosis of catheter-related bacteremia.
AB  - The accuracy of paired quantitative blood cultures (PQtBCs) collected in pediatric Isolator 1.5-ml tubes compared to central venous catheter (CVC) segment cultures (hub and tip) to diagnose catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) was evaluated in 58 bacteremic adult patients. The second aim of this study was to state precisely whether the tip or the hub (or both) of the infected device was the source of the bacteremia in case of significant results of PQtBC. Fifty-eight bacteremic patients with suspected CRB entered the study. In 52 patients, the diagnosis was obtained before CVC removal by PQtBC and was confirmed by CVC segment cultures: CRB in 30 patients, non-catheter-related bacteremia in 22 patients. Six patients had CRB not found by PQtBC. 1) PQtBC is 83% sensitive, 100% specific (negative predictive values 78%, positive predictive values 100%). 2) Sixteen bacteremic patients had authentic hub-related bacteremia (positive hub culture associated with negative tip cultures). When CRB is suspected in bacteremic patients, a negative tip culture cannot exclude the diagnosis of CRB. In all cases, CVC tip culture must be associated either with PQtBC or with hub cultures.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis: bacteriology, hydrocephalus, and outcome.
AB  - To investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. Among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. Of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. Of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. The infecting agents were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and Gram-negative bacilli in six patients (Escherichia coli in two, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Acinetobacter anitratus in two). In one patient, the culture results were negative. All Gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Hydrocephalus finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. No other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics and the development of hydrocephalus was found. All patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on combined effects of fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone for mixed infections of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - The time-lag/sequential/step by step chemotherapy by fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone including a short time small dose of steroid was done for 27 severely infected patients suffered from various cancer or other severe basal diseases. And the staggered "intensive" chemotherapy with added arbekacin or vancomycin to the previous staggered chemotherapy was done against 13 severely infected patients having MRSAs among their infecting pathogens. 1. Bacteriological effects Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6/8, Staphylococcus epidermidis 5/5, Enterococcus faecalis 3/6, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 2/2, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2/2, MRSA 2/2, Xanthomonas maltophilia 2/3 and other 10/10 were eradicated (84.2%) by the staggered chemotherapy and MRSA 7/13, P. aeruginosa 3/4, E. faecalis 3/5, A. calcoaceticus 2/2, X. maltophilia 1/1 and others 2/2 were eradicated (53.8% in MRSA, 78.6% in others and 66.7% in total) and 3 of MRSAs were colonized. 2. Clinical effects 1) Staggered chemotherapy: Excellent 18/27, good 8/27, fair 1/27, poor 0/27 (96.3%). 2) Staggered "intensive" chemotherapy: Excellent 6/13, good 4/13, fair 2/13, poor 1/13 (76.9%) in total: excellent 60.0%, efficacy rate 90.0%.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment of microbial growth in intravenous immune globulin preparations.
AB  - The ability of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) products to support bacterial and yeast growth was studied. Microtiter plates containing preparations of eight commercially available IVIG products were inoculated with 10(5) colony-forming units (CFUs) of bacteria per milliliter or 10(3) CFUs of yeast cells per milliliter. The organisms used were Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The plates were incubated at 3, 25, or 37 degrees C for seven days. For each organism and each temperature, a total of 16 identical wells were studied per preparation. Optical density was measured at 24-hour intervals to determine bacterial growth; yeast growth was determined visually. None of the IVIG preparations supported bacterial growth at any temperature over the seven-day period. No preparation supported visible yeast growth at 3 degrees C; however, most of the preparations did support yeast growth at 25 and 37 degrees C. The failure of the IVIG preparations to support bacterial growth at all temperatures and yeast growth at 3 degrees C suggests that a reconsideration of recommended expiration dates for IVIG products may be warranted.
TI  - Community-acquired bacteremias from tunneled central intravenous lines: results from studies of a single vendor.
AB  - Tunneled central intravenous catheters are a common method for rendering prolonged outpatient intravenous therapy. Their safety, however, has not been well studied. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of bacteremias associated with tunneled central intravenous catheters managed by a single home health care vendor during a 1-year period. All catheters were inserted in the operating room under sterile conditions. To calculate total line days, the dates of catheter insertion and removal were obtained from either the hospital operating room or the home health care agency. Catheter care was conducted according to written protocols. Total line days were calculated. Community-acquired bacteremia (defined as bacteremia occurring more than 6 days after the patients' discharge from the hospital) was determined from records available in the infection control department. Sixty-eight patients received intravenous therapy from the vendor during the 1-year study period. Total line days were 5548 (median 52 days/patient). Eleven episodes of bacteremia occurred in five patients, providing an incidence density rate of 2.0 infections/1000 catheter days. The most frequent bacteria encountered were Staphylococcus epidermidis (five), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (two). Median time to bacteremia was 103 days. Two patients, both younger than 4 years, accounted for seven of the infections; both had short-bowel syndrome. On the basis of historical comparisons, outpatient intravenous therapy appears to be associated with a lower risk of bacteremia than in-hospital therapy. These data can provide quality improvement information and may be a means for comparing home infusion therapy vendors.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin (TFLX) was compared with those of other new quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin) against clinical isolates. These isolates had been collected from May to June 1993 (22 species, 260 strains) and from June to July 1992 (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 87 strains) in Toyama municipal hospital. TFLX showed the most potent activities against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in 1993, at MIC50 levels. The MIC50's of TFLX for these species ranged from 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml. TFLX showed potent activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the MIC50's of TFLX were 0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. However, new quinolone resistant strains (MIC > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml) were found among some species. Especially, the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains resistant to new quinolone exceeded 60% of all the S. aureus isolates in 1993. More MRSA strains resistant to new quinolones were isolated in 1993 than in 1992, and similar result was observed for P. aeruginosa. The coagulase typing was done, and all MRSA strains of resistant to new quinolones produced coagulase type II.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and ex vivo susceptibility of cefpodoxime proxetil in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Pharmacokinetics of cefpodoxime, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, were determined for eight noninfected patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and eight healthy volunteers. Subjects were matched for sex, age (+/- 6 years), and body weight (+/- 10 kg, except for one pair) and received a single 200-mg (cefpodoxime equivalents) oral dose of the prodrug cefpodoxime proxetil in an open-label, paired-design fashion. Dialysate (CAPD group only), plasma, and urine samples were collected and assayed for cefpodoxime by a microbiologic method. In addition, mean bactericidal titers of the effluent dialysate against selected bacterial strains often associated with CAPD-related peritonitis were determined at 6 and 24 h after the dose. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in all pharmacokinetic parameters between healthy and CAPD subjects, except for lag time to absorption. The mean peak plasma cefpodoxime concentration of 1.88 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml occurred at 2.44 +/- 0.5 h for healthy volunteers, while the peak concentration of 3.25 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml occurred at 12.0 +/- 4.2 h for patients on CAPD. The average elimination half-life in CAPD patients was approximately 12 times greater than that seen in healthy volunteers. Peritoneal dialysis had a minimal effect on cefpodoxime clearance. In healthy volunteers, 24.2% +/- 13% of the dose was recovered from the urine, in contrast to only 5.59% +/- 6.9% for CAPD patients. The mean bactericidal titers for all CAPD patients, at 6 and 24 h, were mostly less than 1:2 and did not exceed 1:4 for any of the isolates. Because of the decreased renal clearance and negligible dialysate clearance of cefpodoxime, and delayed drug absorption, the dosage interval for cefpodoxime proxetil may need to be extended in CAPD patients.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - The effects of electric current on bacteria colonising intravenous catheters.
AB  - The effect of a direct electric current (10 microA) on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was investigated. When the ends of negatively-charged intravascular catheters were placed in nutrient agar seeded with bacteria, circular zones of inhibition of bacterial growth were observed around the catheters. The zones ranged from 6 to 16 mm in diameter according to the organism under test. Zones of inhibition were not produced around positively-charged catheters. Bacteria colonising the surfaces of catheters were similarly affected by the application of a 10 microA electric current. A negative electric current applied to colonised catheters for 4 to 24 h significantly reduced the number of adherent viable organisms as compared to controls. The results demonstrated that a constant electric current of low amperage might be used to reduce bacterial colonisation of intravascular catheters. This may offer a novel means of protecting catheters and other prosthetic devices from associated sepsis in vivo.
TI  - In vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  - Although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. Microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. Gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. We therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative rods against antibiotics. Using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by Maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for Port-A-Cath-systems. Organisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae). All organisms but Klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. Production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated Pseudomonas. After 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with various antimicrobial agents. The following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. Despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective MICs of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. E. coli was found to be the most susceptible organism. These in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - In vitro survival of skin flora in heparin locks and needleless valve infusion devices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which two types of infusion devices, the heparin lock and a needleless valve device, allowed the persistence of inoculated microorganisms. DESIGN: Experiment. SETTING: Clinical microbiology laboratory. OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacterial counts in infusion devices. INTERVENTION: Five of each type of device were inoculated with approximately 10(5) colony-forming units of a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes and tested for growth at seven time intervals, from 10 minutes to 72 hours after inoculation. RESULTS: Both strains of bacteria were present in each device at every time interval tested, including 72 hours after inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria introduced into a heparin lock or valve device may be isolated for prolonged periods of time. This suggests that if such devices are contaminated during use, they may be a potential source of infection. The risk of infection should be one major consideration in risk and benefit deliberations when choosing new products.
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and Septi-Chek Release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - A controlled clinical comparison was made of the Isolator (Wampole Laboratories,  Cranbury, N.J.) and the Septi-Chek Release bottle (Roche Diagnostics, Nutley, N.J.). From 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to Centers for Disease Control definitions. Statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the Isolator system: Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.0001), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (P = 0.008), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P = 0.05), Salmonella spp. (P = 0.03), and Candida albicans (P = 0.02). The Septi-Chek Release system required a longer period of time than the Isolator system for detection of the following organisms:S. aureus (P = 0.0001), Enterococcus spp. (P = 0.0001), Enterobacter cloacae (P = 0.03), Escherichia coli (P = 0.0001), Klebsiella oxytoca (P = 0.03), K. pneumoniae (P = 0.02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.002), and C. albicans (P = 0.005). There were 430 episodes of bloodstream infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to S. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (P = 0.0001) by the Isolator system than by the Septi-Chek Release system. However, episodes of bloodstream infections due to S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., and E. coli were detected significantly faster by the Isolator system.
TI  - Opportunistic nosocomial multiply resistant bacterial infections--their treatment and prevention.
AB  - One of the most difficult problems confronting the clinician who deals with nosocomial infections is that of microbial resistance. The predominant nosocomial infections (urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicaemia, surgical wound infections) involve increasing numbers of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium jeikeium or resistant enterococci as well as new multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli such as Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans. The emergence and spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae producing novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases active against third-generation cephalosporins contribute to the difficulty in treating nosocomial infections.
TI  - Effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. The blood was inoculated with one of five species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per mL. The growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees C storage period of the platelet concentrates. One species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, failed to grow in any of the components. The remaining species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by Day 3. Although the concentration of bacteria immediately after inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. Data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.
TI  - Continuing the search for bacterial urovirulence factors.
AB  - Bacteria that commonly cause infections of the normal urinary tract (eg Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) do so because they possess specific urovirulence factors. Adhesions of various types (often fimbriae) seem to be the most important of these. In E. coli several other factors have been recognized, and sub-sets of defined uropathogenic clones exist. On the other hand, urovirulence determinants are less easy to distinguish in species such as S. epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that rarely cause such infections, or are pathogenic only in the presence of some abnormality or deficiency in host defences.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Mallorca, Spain, 1977-1991.
AB  - In a retrospective study at Son Dureta Hospital (Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca, Spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. Overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. The case-fatality rate was 7.5%. Infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group B Streptococcus and Listeria species. The patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. From 1977 to 1984, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. Group B Streptococcus organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. The frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. Invasive infection caused by Candida organisms was found in two patients. The incidence of infection due to group B streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - In vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. To evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at pH of 7.2. Clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. Methicillin-susceptible S aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. Cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against E coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus S pneumoniae. The gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against K pneumoniae and E coli. These results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible S aureus, K pneumoniae, and E coli. Prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. In murine systemic infections, FK037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA). It was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae, except Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except MRSA and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was more effective than cefpirome. These results correlated well with its in vitro activity. In murine local infections, with few exceptions, FK037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against Klebsiella pneumonia in ED50 values and against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with S. aureus and E. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. It is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of FK037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and P. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. In addition, the therapeutic effects of FK037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to MSSA, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for MSSA, 0.063 to 0.125 g for K. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for P. aeruginosa). FK037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with MSSA in neutropenic mice. These results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - Evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  - To investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. All mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. At 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The day of inoculation was designated Day 0. On Day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded P. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus morbillorum. On Days 6, 7 and 8, Group A mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. Group B mares received infusions of saline only. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in Group A than Group B mares on Days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). Swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in Group A yielded growth of fungi on Days 13 and 19. Mares in Group B were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on Days 19, 20 and 21. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on Days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not recovered from these mares at any time. The incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in Group A and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microorganisms associated with natural fermentation of Prosopis africana seeds for the production of okpiye.
AB  - Okpiye is a food condiment prepared by the fermentation of Prosopis africana seeds. The traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the condiment were investigated. During laboratory fermentation that lasted 96 h, the mesquite seeds underwent a natural fermentation that was characterised by the growth of microorganisms to 10(6)-10(8) cfu/g. Several species of bacteria especially B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus spp were found to be the most actively involved organisms. However, significant contributions to the microbial ecology were made by Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Lactobacillus spp were present in low numbers towards the end of the fermentation. The presence of Proteus and Pseudomonas spp in traditional fermented samples demonstrate the variability which may exist in the microflora of individual fermented samples. Variations in the important microbial groups show that Bacillus spp were the most prevalent species and occurred until the end of fermentation. Temperature, pH and titratable acidity varied with time and were influenced by the metabolic activities of the microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of paper money].
AB  - Bacteriological survey of one hundred twenty currency notes was done. Aerobic spore-forming bacilli (91%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (63.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.2%), Enterococcus (24.1%), alpha-hem. streptococcus (4.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.7%), Corynebacterium (7.5%), Lactobacilli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), Enterobacter (19.2%), E. coli (17.5%), Proteus (1.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.8%), Shigella flexneri (0.8%) were isolated from paper money samples. Currency notes in general were bacteriologically contaminated especially with enteric pathogens and potentially pathogens, it was thought that some measures have to be taken to reduce these ill effects.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - [Resistant rate to antibiotics in Tian Tan Hospital for 3 years].
AB  - The resistance to antibiotics of the 985 clinical isolates collected in Tian Tan  hospital was studied. The results showed that S. aureus had a resistant rate of more than 90% to penicillin and was also highly resistant to erythromycin. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 15.6% of all the isolates with S. aureus. The isolation rate of MRSA is lower than that in other countries or districts of West Pacific Area. K. pneumonia and other Gram negative bacilli had a resistant rate of 0.6% to amikacin and P. aeruginosa was all sensitive to Polymyxin-B.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  - During the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. The frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. Despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. This was opposite to the decreased frequencies of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus were ranked as major pathogens. Among the recent isolates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. Therefore, until more effective means for control of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.
TI  - Development of cutaneous microflora in premature neonates.
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) are a frequent cause of bacteraemia in premature neonates. It is likely that the strains of C-NS causing bacterial sepsis in premature neonates have their origin on the patient's skin surface. We have studied the quantitative development of the skin microflora at eight sites on premature neonates. A swab wash method was used to sample and enumerate the cutaneous microflora of premature neonates admitted to an intensive care unit with respiratory distress syndrome. The numbers of bacteria present on the skin increased rapidly by 100-fold in the first week of life. The species of C-NS found on neonatal skin were similar to those found on adult skin. However, the bacterial population was 10(3) lower by comparison. There was considerable variation in numbers of bacteria and in the proportion resistant to antibiotics from day to day. There appeared to be no association between antibiotic usage and the proportion of isolates resistant to antibiotics, although the resident bacteria were in many cases resistant to a variety of antibiotics. C-NS were isolated from 92% of samples from which bacteria were isolated. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found at all sites and accounted for 82% of each colonial type of staphylococcus isolated. Other organisms isolated included Propionibacterium sp, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, aerobic spore-bearing bacilli, aerobic coryneforms, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pityrosporum sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The results of this study suggest that the skin of premature neonates is colonised with antibiotic resistant C-NS during the first week of life and that the chance of contamination of an intravascular catheter at insertion increases during this period.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Evaluation of the so-called basic cephalosporins using the serum bactericidal test].
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was studied one hour and four hours after intravenous administration of 1 g and 2 g cefotiam, 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin to six volunteers. The 136 clinical isolates tested included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. One hour after administration no significant differences in the activity against staphylococci were noted in the antibiotics tested. Four hours after administration of cefazolin 96% of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were killed at a serum dilution of 1:8, whereas only one strain was killed by cefuroxime and none by cefotiam under the same conditions. The highest SBA-titers against Haemophilus influenzae were achieved with cefotiam at a dosage of 2 g. SBA-titers against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were higher after administration of 1 g cefotiam than after administration of 1.5 g cefuroxime and 2 g cefazolin, respectively.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Infections in acute myeloid leukemia. Study of 184 febrile episodes.
AB  - We analysed the case records of 75 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia treated  at our institute from January 1984 to December 1988 to see the pattern and severity of infections and their relationship with granulocytopenia. A total of 184 febrile episodes (mean 2.45) were recorded; 153 (83.15%) were associated with granulocytopenia while 31 (16.84%) were without granulocytopenia. Among granulocytopenic patients, infections could be documented microbiologically in 58.2% and clinically in 30.0% of episodes. In the remaining 41.8% of episodes, no clinical, radiological or microbiological evidence could be found out. The various sites of infection were: septicaemia 21 (13.72%), disseminated fungal infections 4 (2.6%), upper respiratory tract 21 (13.7%), chest 58 (37.9%), gastrointestinal tract 8 (5.2%), genitourinary (7.2%), soft tissues 5 (3.2%) and skin cellulitis 7 (4.6%). Microbiologically, gram negative organisms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, E coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were most common, followed by gram positive (Streptococcal faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph albus, Staph epidermidis). Four patients had disseminated fungal infection: candida 2, aspergillus *1, mucormycosis *1. Among non neutropenic febrile episodes, the sites infected were: septicemia 2 (6.4%), chest 9(29.0%), upper respiratory tract 1 (3.2%), gastrointestinal 1 (3.2%), soft tissue 1 (3.2%), drug fever 3 (9.6%) and fever of unknown origin 14 (45.2%).
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - Septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  - 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus species and Pneumococcus) and 41% Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter). Compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Thus, a shift from a predominating Gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating Gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. In both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with Gram-negative septicemia, especially in patients with a Ps, aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on Staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), Salmonella typhimurium (Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re of LPS mutants) and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (209P, Cowan I, Smith diffuse and Smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and K) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. Escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, such as Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. Lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against M. lysodeikticus and B. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against S. typhimurium and S. aureus. With regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, NP1, NP4, and NP5, NP1 showed strong bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. Neither NP4 nor NP5 showed any bactericidal activity, while NP5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of NP1 against K. pneumoniae 277.
TI  - Clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  - In a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). Twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. The lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and CIEP. CIEP was done to detect the bacterial antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. Low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. Altogether, a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). In 10 babies, Strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. Micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. Eleven babies (25%) grew Gram negative bacteria. The common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were Strep. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinatobacter lowfii, Staph. aureus, Pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. All the Gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. All staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative trial of norfloxacin and macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin) in the prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection in women.
AB  - Eighty-eight women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (at least  four attacks in the preceding 12 months) were randomized to take either norfloxacin 200 mg at night (45 patients) or macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin 100 mg at night (43 patients) for 12 months. A decrease in the number of symptomatic attacks while taking this prophylaxis was observed in 94 per cent of the patients and this improvement was maintained during the 6 months following the end of prophylaxis in 69 per cent. The mean interval between symptomatic episodes while taking prophylaxis was 7.2-fold and 6.9-fold greater, respectively, than in the 12 months before starting prophylaxis. There were only nine breakthrough infections during 74 patient-years of prophylaxis, four in patients taking norfloxacin (two enterococci, one Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Escherichia coli), and five in those taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (four E. coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae). Adverse events caused four patients taking norfloxacin (8 per cent) and seven taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (14 per cent) to stop prophylaxis. Norfloxacin had a marked suppressive effect on the coliform part of the faecal flora, with no emergence of resistance. Thus, norfloxacin appears to be an excellent alternative agent to macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin for the prevention of recurrent urinary infections.
TI  - [Intraocular penetration of DR-3355, a new quinolone derivative].
AB  - We studied the intraocular penetration of DR-3355, a new quinolone derivative in  white mature rabbits. DR-3355 concentration in the aqueous humor reached the maximum, 1.06 micrograms/ml, at 2 hours after oral administration of 20 mg/kg in single dose. Six hours after it was 0.37 micrograms/ml. At 2 hours, the concentration ratio in the aqueous humor and serum was 23.3%. The pharmacokinetic parameters of DR-3355 levels in both of the aqueous humor and serum were: Cmax, 1.02 micrograms/ml and 4.56 micrograms/ml; Tmax, 1.42 hours and 1.47 hours; T 1/2, 0.96 hours and 1.57 hours; and AUC, 3.91 micrograms.hr/ml and 19.70 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. At 2 hours after oral administration, the ocular tissue concentrations were 3.84-16.10 micrograms/g in the outer parts of the eye, and 0.70-13.52 micrograms/g or ml in the inner parts of the eye. Those concentrations decreased to about 1/2 to 1/32 in the outer parts, and 1/2 to 1/7 in the inner parts of the eye at 6 hours. Those ocular tissue concentrations of DR-3355 exceeded the MIC90 of the compound against various bacteria of ocular pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in an urological department. Incidence and etiological factors].
AB  - The authors report a prospective study with active request of data for nosocomial infections (NI) in an urological department during six months. From 453 patients, 43 developed an NI (incidence = 9.5%): urinary tract infections (53.5%), bloodstream infections (16.3%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), surgical wound infections (2.3%) and sepsis syndrome (20.9%). For microorganisms, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and E. coli (20%) were encountered. Other microorganisms were the next-ones: Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.5%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.5%), Streptococcus group D (7.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), Candida albicans (2.5%) and others (10%). Urological interventions with a high risk of NI were cystectomy with intestinal urinary diversion (68.7%), pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (40%) and percutaneous nephrolitothomy (30%). Even if the last two interventions classically do not have a high risk of NI, we think that their antibioprophylaxis is recommended.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Bacterial colonisation of humidifier attachments on oxygen concentrators prescribed for long term oxygen therapy: a district review.
AB  - A microbiological survey was undertaken on the eight patients in the Liverpool District who have a humidifier attachment on their oxygen concentrator. All but one of the humidifiers were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oxycephem OCP 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OCP 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at C-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at C-3. OCP 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog ME 1228 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was equivalent. OCP 9-176 was twofold less active than ME-1228 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Activity of the two agents was similar against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although OCP 9-176 inhibited E. coli containing TEM-1 and TEM-2, it was less active than ME-1228. Klebsiella organisms with SHV-1 and K-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but TEM-3-containing isolates had MICs of 16 micrograms/ml. OCP 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by TEM-1, PSE-1, K-1, and P99, and it was a poor inhibitor of P99. Replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at C-3.
TI  - Epidemiology of beta-lactamases in Africa: correlation with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In 45 centers from eight African countries, 2,888 bacterial isolates were collected from patients with community-acquired infections. Isolated pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Escherichia coli (20%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%), Proteus species (6%), Klebsiella species (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (4%). An overall sensitivity of 16.2% was shown to penicillin G (number of isolates tested = 2,467), 31.8% to ampicillin (2,687), 45% to amoxicillin (1,959), and 84.9% to cefuroxime (2,888). Beta-lactamase presence was measured by a chromogenic method. Beta-lactamase was found in 75% of all pathogens tested, including 69.5% of gram-negative and 83.3% of gram-positive pathogens; 73% of E coli isolates, 76% of N gonorrhoeae, 75% of Klebsiella species, and 84% of S aureus were beta-lactamase positive. Beta-lactamase presence was associated with bacterial resistance for penicillin G, ampicillin, and amoxicillin, but not cefuroxime, whose sensitivity remained high. The higher resistance rates and beta-lactamase prevalence in Africa suggest the need for national antibiotic prescribing policies and surveillance schemes and replacement of relatively ineffective penicillins with newer agents such as cefuroxime.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - Purification of equine neutrophil lysozyme and its antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Lysozyme from equine neutrophil granulocytes was isolated in a pure form by fast  performance liquid chromatography, i.e. ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The lysozyme lysed Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus lentus and was also bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Serratia marcescens. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were not lysed. The lysozyme was only very slightly bactericidal for S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Equine neutrophil lysozyme was found to be bactericidal for Gram-positive as well as for Gram-negative bacteria without further treatment. Equine and chicken egg white lysozymes were found to be immunologically related when examined using specific antisera against each of them. Both lysozymes also had very similar specific enzymatic activities against M. luteus membranes.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - [Septicemia in children with malignant disease].
AB  - Severe infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with malignancy. In this study, 34 episodes of septicemia occurred in 1,468 childhood patients with malignancy who admitted and were treated at National Sapporo Hospital between 1979 and 1988. The occurrence of septicemia and its mortality rate were higher in malignant hematologic disease than in malignant solid tumor. Most cases of septicemia occurred in relapse. The most frequent organism causing septicemia were Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.3%). Septicemia due to Gram-negative organism was more frequent than that of Gram-positive organism or fungus. Polymicrobic septicemia occurred 3 times and multiple episodes 6 times. They had a high mortality rate. Neutropenia was strongly associated with episode of septicemia. In our series, absolute neutrophil count under 500 per microliter developed septicemia. Especially, children with less than 100 granulocytes per microliter had a major risk factor for the development of infection and death. No children with granulocyte count greater than 1000 per microliter died in connection with septicemia.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A case of Fournier's gangrene: was it triggered by prostatic massage?].
AB  - We have experienced a case of Fournier's gangrene which progressed rapidly after  prostatic massage. The patient was a 70-year-old man who had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hemorrhoid, urethral stricture and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He visited an urologist complaining of pollakisuria and miction pain. Under the diagnosis of prostatitis, prostatic massage was performed. From that night, he developed a high grade fever. Simultaneously, redness, swelling and pain of the scrotum progressed rapidly, and 11 days later, he was admitted to our hospital. An X-ray examination revealed subcutaneous gas formation in the scrotum. Immediately, incision and drainage with extensive debridement of necrotic tissue were performed combined with chemotherapy using broad spectrum antibiotics and insulin therapy. About 3 months later, the gangrene and the wound were healed with granulation and scarring. Cultures of the pus and the necrotic tissue from the scrotum were positive for Bacteroides fragilis and several aerobes including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The case proved to be non-clostridial gas gangrene.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - [Neonatal septicemia: differences in full-term and pre-term newborn infants].
AB  - Neonatal septicemia was assessed by blood cultures in 115 newborns (NB) during a  two years study in a pediatric hospital of reference in Mexico City. The studied patients were divided in two groups of gestational age, and the differences of etiologic agents, clinical signs, laboratory findings and clinical outcome were compared at term and preterm neonates. We observed Staphylococcus epidermidis became the first cause of septicemia in at term NB (P less than 0.001), while Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than 0.01) were more frequent in the preterm neonates. The clinical manifestations of fever (P less than 0.001), hepatomegaly (P less than 0.01), splenomegaly (P less than 0.05), and rejection to feeding (P less than 0.05) were more common in at term NB. On the other hand, apneas (P less than 0.01), hypothermia (P less than 0.02), and abdominal distension (P less than 0.05) were more frequent in the preterm NB. The altered white blood cell counts were more commonly observed in the preterm group, as leukopenia (P less than 0.05), neutropenia (P less than 0.01), and high I/T ratio (P less than 0.05). There were not significant differences in complications or sequels between the two groups; however, the mortality ratio was higher in the preterm NB group (P less than 0.02). Changing etiology of neonatal septicemia is discussed, and we propose these kind of data are very useful for purpose of detection, diagnostic and treatment of septic neonates.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Sepsis of vascular catheters. II: In vitro disinfection of colonized tubing.
AB  - Preparatory to development of in situ disinfection of implanted catheters, silicone rubber tubing colonized by incubation with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae was used to test the efficacy of various chemicals in vitro. Protocols sterilizing all segments colonized for 24 h (n = 30) were immersion into 50% povidone iodine for 5 and 60 min, 100% povidone iodine for 5, 15, and 60 min, 1.2 x 10(3) ppm chlorine dioxide for 15 and 60 min, and 1.2 x 10(3) ppm chlorine dioxide buffered to pH 5.1 for 60 min. Immersion in up to 2% chlorhexidine, 7.4% formaldehyde, or 6% sodium hypochlorite for up to 60 min failed to sterilize all segments. None of 117 control segments were sterilized. Segments colonized for seven days were sterilized by immersion into 100% povidone iodine for 15 or 60 min. Use of 1.2 x 10(3) ppm chlorine dioxide for 60 min sterilized 97% of segments tested. Lower concentrations and shorter exposure times failed to sterilize all segments. Eighteen silicone rubber catheters, colonized on the outer surface, were all sterilized within 24 h by a chlorine dioxide solution placed in the lumen and diffusing through the wall to kill the bacteria.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of zinc oxide in vitro.
AB  - Antibacterial activity, zinc concentrations and pH were measured in Muller-Hinton broth containing different amounts of zinc oxide and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (10(6) colony forming units/ml). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of zinc oxide to different clinical isolates were determined using the Muller-Hinton agar dilution tests. Gram-positive bacteria were most susceptible. Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and streptococci were usually not inhibited even at the highest concentrations used (1024 micrograms/ml), but staphylococci--particularly some isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis--were sensitive enough to allow determination of their MIC.
TI  - Lytic effect of Vibrio cholerae elastase on gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Elastase of Vibrio cholerae caused the lysis of freshly grown cells of Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi A and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) organisms were resistant to this enzyme. Heat killed and lyophilized Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (except S. aureus and S. epidermidis) showed higher sensitivity to elastase. Both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria were lyzed maximally by elastase at pH 8.0. At this pH, lytic activity of elastase was maximum in Tris-HCl and glycine-NaOH buffers followed by Tris-maleate and cacodylate buffers.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - We compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Tazobactam prevention of emergence of resistance.
AB  
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cephalothin. Reevaluation of MIC break points in 4 category system of disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The reliability of the cephalothin (CET) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 248 strains and using Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET) and Difco discs (6 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CET). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CET disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, was reevaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. The results obtained with the disc methods were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CET disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 15 out of the 248 strains (6.0%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test, 18 out of the 248 strains (7.3%) tested showed false positive results and 6 (2.4%) showed false negative results. Excluding Enterococcus faecalis from the test, results because better in the quantitative estimation of MICs, resulting false positive rates of 3.2% (Showa), and 4.4% (Difco). A 3 category system of the interpretation of disc test is generally used in the USA and Europe. MIC break points proposed for the classification of the CET test are sensitive, MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, and resistance, MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. With the Showa disc susceptibility test, 14 out of the 248 strains (5.6%) tested showed false positive results and 6 strains (2.4%) showed false negative results. With the Difco disc test 7 out of the 248 strains (2.8%) showed false positive results and 21 strains (8.5%) showed false negative results. In this study, MIC70S of CET against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 1.56 and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. CET was not so effective against Gram-negative rods except Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. MIC70S against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 3.13, and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine isolated from Prosopis juliflora.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from Prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two Candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. Significant inhibitory effect was noted against Gram positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. citreus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against S. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. lactis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, C. hofmannii and Bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. Its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. The inhibitory effect of julifloricine on Gram negative bacteria such as the species of Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Aeromonas and Vibrio was almost insignificant. Julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against C. tropicalis and responded equally to C. albicans. As compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which included Herpes simplex 1 and Newcastle disease virus. Julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Evaluation of the treatment with oral ciprofloxacin: experience with 24 patients].
AB  - We have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). Two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. In most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. Only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. Seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. The isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: E. coli (9), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). There were only two gram positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The overall clinical response rate was 91%. Gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. Colonization by Candida or Enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. Four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. Ciprofloxacin appears as an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including severe enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  - To study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptor (FcRlo, CR1, and CR3)-mediated phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups A and B streptococci were examined. IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  - Soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees C underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of pH from 6.5 to 4.5. Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter diversus and Bacillus brevis, and the yeasts Pichia burtonii, Candida didensiae and Rhodotorula rubra. Fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures of these isolates showed L. casei, Strep. faecium and Staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the pH reduction. Soybeans were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation. Boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
TI  - Characterization of a wide host range plasmid pANV-6 from Citrobacter diversus.
AB  - pANV-6 is a 5.85 kb, streptomycin resistant, high copy number plasmid isolated from a multi drug resistant clinical isolate of C. diversus by transformation in Escherichia coli C-600. The plasmid was very stable, noncurable and could not be amplified with chloramphenicol. It was non-conjugative among Enterobacteriaceae hosts. Plasmid was transferred by transformation to several Gram negative and Gram positive hosts. These included Esch. coli, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium glutamicum. From Staph. aureus it was transferred by conjugation to other Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis. Plasmid was incompatible with standard plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups H1, H2 = S,J,P and T of coliform bacteria. Plasmid has one site for restriction enzyme EcoRI and Pst I, three for Bgl 1 and non for Bgl 1, Bam HI, Hind III and X ba I.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  - Over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. The rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. It is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to intravenous cannulae: influence of implantation in the rabbit and of enzyme treatments.
AB  - Comparison was made of the adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six types of intravascular cannula material. Adhesion to materials removed from rabbit tissues did not differ significantly between types of material or between bacterial species. In contrast, major differences were found when unimplanted materials were examined; the overall rank order of adhesiveness of bacteria to unimplanted materials (S. epidermidis greater than P. aeruginosa greater than S. aureus much greater than K. aerogenes greater than E. coli) was highly significant (F = 13.0, P less than 0.0005), and although no single material was consistently least attractive to all micro-organisms, FEP-Teflon and PTFE-Teflon showed significantly lower overall affinity for bacteria than other materials (P less than 0.001); all species showed a significant preference for a silicone polymer (P less than 0.0005). The nature of the bacterial surface structures responsible for adhesion were investigated by the actions of pronase and mixed glycosidase, which produced significant respective decreases and increases in adhesion of staphylococci to unimplanted materials; their effects on the Gram-negative bacilli were less consistent.
TI  - Management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Interaction of ceftriaxone with human polymorphonuclear neutrophil function.
AB  - Ceftriaxone, an amino-2-thiazolyl cephalosporin, has been shown to cooperate in vitro with human neutrophils for the killing of some bacteria. In this work the direct interaction with human leucocyte bactericidal function has been studied. Ceftriaxone (1000 to 1 mg/l) did not alter neutrophil chemotaxis or superoxide anion production. It also did not interfere with the chemiluminescence response of isolated PMN although a paradoxical depressive effect was observed with whole human blood in the case of zymosan stimulation. The killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae was not enhanced by ceftriaxone and phagocytosis was significantly depressed only with adherent neutrophils but not when using neutrophils in liquid medium. It is concluded that the synergy observed between leucocyte and ceftriaxone for bacterial killing cannot be related to a direct stimulation of neutrophil functions and should depend on bacterial alteration.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The value of prophylactic antibiotics during the insertion of long-term indwelling silastic right atrial catheters in cancer patients.
AB  - Over a 3.5 year period from August 1982 to December 1985, 200 Hickman catheters (Evermed, Medina, WA) were inserted into patients at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. One hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. Seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. The mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. Exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. The mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (SD, 1.2 days). Organisms cultured from catheter associated infections, included Staphylococcus epidermidis 36, S. aureus 30, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, Escherichia coli 1, and diphtheroids non-CDC-JK 3. Vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, Kefzol (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and Septra (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) in one. The data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection. Prophylactic antibiotic coverage should be provided to patients during insertion of long-term indwelling right atrial catheters.
TI  - [Studies on antibacterial activity of flomoxef and its distribution to serum and  intraperitoneal exudate in surgery].
AB  - 1. Bacteria detected in cases of acute abdominal ailments encountered in the first department of surgery at Hiroshima university and its related facilities during the recent 4 and a half years were reviewed and the antibacterial activities of flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) against these isolates were investigated. As a result, this antibiotic was found to show very high activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus spp. 2. One gram of FMOX dissolved in 100 ml of physiological saline was administered by intravenous drip infusion during operation and its concentrations in serum and intraperitoneal exudate were determined. The intraperitoneal exudate concentration exceeded the serum concentration in 2 hours after the completion of the drip infusion and, reached high enough concentration to be effective against susceptible bacteria with MICs about 12.5 micrograms/ml. The above results suggested that the new cephem antibiotic FMOX for injection should be sufficiently effective against acute peritonitis.
TI  - Evidence that bacteria induce translocation of protein kinase C activity in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Particulate fraction associated protein kinase activity was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was found to increase particulate fraction associated protein kinase C activity in a time and concentration dependent manner. The increase comprised both the phospholipid dependent and independent kinase activity and was augmented by addition of serum. Similar observations were done using Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiellae pneumoniae. However, Escherichia coli only increased the phospholipid independent kinase activity in the particulate fraction, which suggests the presence of protease activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - CS-807 is a new oral prodrug of R-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - The growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition admixtures.
AB  - Total nutrient admixtures (TNAs) containing glucose, amino acids, and lipid emulsion in one container and amino acid/dextrose solutions [conventional total parenteral nutrition (TPN) formulations] were studied in a controlled laboratory experiment for their ability to support the growth of microorganisms. Both TNA and conventional TPN formulations for peripheral and central venous administration with standard additives were inoculated with microorganisms to provide 10(1)-10(2) colony-forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. The admixtures were stored at room temperature and samples for quantitative microbiology were taken at time 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were able to proliferate in central TNAs, but the growth of these organisms was retarded in conventional TPN solutions. In the peripheral formulations, K. pneumoniae and E. coli proliferated in both the TNA and conventional TPN systems, whereas P. aeruginosa grew well only in the peripheral TNA. S. epidermidis was not able to grow in any admixtures tested; however, C. albicans grew well in all admixtures, but growth was slower in the conventional central TPN. In conclusion, peripheral and central TNAs supported the growth of microorganisms significantly better than conventional TPN solutions.
TI  - Non-IgE-dependent bacteria-induced histamine release from human lung and tonsillar mast cells.
AB  - A wide spectrum of formalin-killed bacteria have been tested for their ability to release histamine from human dispersed lung and tonsillar mast cells. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca and K. pneumoniae were the most effective histamine releasers. Further studies on tonsillar mast cells showed that E. coli-induced histamine release differed from IgE-dependent release with respect to its kinetics, temperature and pH profiles and its sensitivity to calcium deprivation and metabolic inhibitors. A lectin-mediated mechanism may operate, but other non-immunological mechanisms might also be involved in the release. Escherichia coli and anti-IgE did not synergize in inducing histamine release. The production of PGD2 and the failure to detect lactate dehydrogenase following incubation of mast cells with E. coli suggests that histamine release is not due to cytotoxicity.

TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - To study the transfer of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. When CZON 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. Concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. The area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms X hr/ml. From these results CZON was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary against infections of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacteroides fragilis. In 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of CZON was good in 2 cases and unknown in the other case.
TI  - [Treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic children by ceftazidime combined with netilmicin. Results of a multicenter study apropos of 88 cases].
AB  - Infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. In a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non Hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). Median age was 7 years (2 months-16 years). In patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was added after 48 hours. The effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. The first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. Bacteria were isolated in 39 children: Escherichia coli: 9, Staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, Staphylococcus aureus: 8, Streptococcus: 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, Haemophilus: 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, Proteus: 1, Serratia: 1, Flavobacterium: 1. In these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. All blood culture were negative after the first combination. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). There were no death, no superinfection. Tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. We conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
AB  - The effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. Human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. In contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Microbiological perspectives of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide and trimethoprim against isolates of 24 gram-negative and 11 gram-positive species. The incidence of more than 10% of strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations above 32 mg/l was restricted to Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Occasionally, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains with MICs above 32 mg/l were identified. Co-trimoxazole in vitro activity was superior to the comparative drugs for the majority of species. Co-trimoxazole remains an active combination against major pathogens of infections of the upper and lower respiratory, urinary tract and enteric infections with a still low incidence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ambulance oxygen humidifier water reservoirs: a potential source of pulmonary infection.
AB  - The risk and benefit of oxygen humidification during ambulance transport is unknown. We cultured the water in plastic multiple-use bottles of humidifiers on 30 randomly selected area ambulances during November 1985. There were 22 positive cultures. Potentially pathogenic bacteria (four Pseudomonas maltophilia, three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one Staphylococcus epidermidis) were found in nine samples. Assuming that the water in ambulance humidifiers should have been sterile, the findings are statistically significant (P less than .01). Because there is no evidence that humidification is of benefit for nonintubated patients receiving oxygen at flow rates of 4 L/min or less when environmental humidity is adequate, we suggest that such patients should receive oxygen without humidification during ambulance transport. All other patients requiring oxygen during ambulance transport should continue to receive humidified oxygen. If a multiple-use humidifier reservoir is to be used, a written policy for its use must be developed and there must be appropriate documentation of compliance with the policy. An alternative is to replace the multiple-use humidifier reservoir with single-use sterile disposable devices, which cost approximately $2.00 per unit.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - The nosocomial colonization of T. Bear.
AB  - A national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the National Institutes of Health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. The program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (T. Bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. One of the items used is a stuffed toy T. Bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. Considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the T. Bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. A prospective study of 39 sterilized T. Bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. Hospital acquired organisms cultured from the T. Bear included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, Corynebacterium acnes, Micrococcus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, and species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Aspergillus and others. Concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. Although the T. Bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Effect of 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, and vincristine on the antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotiam, piperacillin, and netilmicin.
AB  - Using the checkerboard agar dilution technique, antibacterial activity and in vitro interactions of 4 antineoplastic agents and 5 antimicrobial drugs were examined against 56 strains of 7 bacterial species. 5-fluorouracil was found to inhibit all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and of Staphylococcus epidermidis at a concentration of 0.8 micrograms/ml or less. 84% of all gram-negative strains were inhibited synergistically when 5-fluorouracil was combined with beta-lactam antibiotics. Methotrexate and cefotiam were antagonistic in 42% of all combinations, especially when tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  - Parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. Infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. A variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. The exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. Susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may all play some role. Controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions, attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. In addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. Many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. Well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Population analysis of susceptibility to cefotaxime and desacetyl-cefotaxime in Staphylococcus and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Population analyses of susceptibility to cefotaxime (CTX) and desacetyl-cefotaxime (DCTX) of strains of Staphylococcus and some genera of Enterobacteriaceae were carried out. DCTX, which is the main metabolite of CTX, has antimicrobial activity. The penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were homogeneous as regards susceptibility to both agents. CTX was about 4-8 times more active than DCTX. The methicillin-resistant strains contained a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both CTX and DCTX. The frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-6) - 10(-5). The E. coli strain was homogeneous to both agents. The strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii had a sub-population of resistant bacteria with both agents. The frequency of resistant bacteria was 10(-7) - 10(-4.5). In Klebsiella pneumoniae no resistant sub-population was found. CTX was about four times more active than DCTX with the strains of the Enterobacteriaceae. DCTX had no advantage over CTX as regards homogeneity of susceptibility of the populations examined. CTX seems applicable for treatment of infections with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and penicillinase-producing, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, but should not be used alone in treatments of infections with Enterobacter cloacae or Citrobacter freundii.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Symposium on infections in the compromised host. The leukemias.
AB  - The treatment of acute leukemia in the adult causes prolonged and profound granulocytopenia. When the patient has less than 100 granulocytes per microliter, the risk of life-threatening infection is extremely high. Major infections include bacteremia, pneumonia, pharyngitis, esophagitis, colitis, perianal or perirectal lesions, and cellulitis. The major organisms are gram-negative bacilli (especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts (Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata), and the filamentous fungi (Aspergillus flavus and fumigatus). Infection prevention includes the return to normal of the patient's host defense mechanisms, reduction of invasive procedures which breach body barriers, and methods to decrease the acquisition of potential pathogens, and to reduce the number of organisms colonizing the patient.
TI  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis in a 6-week-old infant.
AB  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis was documented in a 6-week-old infant with Klebsiella  pneumoniae sepsis who received many medications. We inoculated infant mice with the K. pneumoniae isolate but were unable to produce histologic changes resembling those seen in our patient. This condition should be included in the differential diagnosis of severe drug reactions in very young infants with clinical scalded-skin syndromes.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 48 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty-two aerobic and 93 anaerobic isolates were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were involved in 22 patients (46%), and anaerobic organisms only were involved in five patients (10%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 21 patients (44%). The most common bacteria isolated were Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (40% of patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). There were 50 beta-lactamase-producing organisms (26 anaerobes and 24 aerobes) recovered from 33 patients (69%). Forty-four of these bacteria were isolated from the 37 patients recently treated with a penicillin. These included all ten isolates of S aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group, 11 of 19 of B melaninogenicus group, five of the 14 P aeruginosa, three of ten K pneumoniae, three of six of Bacteroides oralis, four of six of Haemophilus influenzae, two of three of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and two of four of Branhamella catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase-producing organisms have a possible role in the failure of penicillin therapy.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Effect of an expanded physical facility on nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - Fifty-two months' data were reviewed to assess the effect of a threefold increase in space per infant in a neonatal intensive care unit on rates of nosocomial infections (NIs) and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (39 months in a crowded 18-bed unit and 13 months in a spacious 32-bed unit). Mean length of stay, survival rates, mean birth weights, and other parameters indicated that infant populations in the old and new units were similar. NI rates were not significantly different in the old and new units (11.7% and 9.6%, respectively; p = 0.17) nor were rates of colonization of anterior nares with S. aureus (11.7% and 10.7%; p = 0.5). NI rates, but not S. aureus colonization rates, were significantly higher during months of high patient turnover (p less than 0.01). Sites of infection were similar in the old and new units. There was, however, a significant change in bacterial species causing NI. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused 20.4% of NIs in the old unit, but only 2.1% in the new unit (p less than 0.001) and NIs caused by S. epidermidis increased from 4.7% to 14.9% (p = 0.02) in the new unit. There was also a marked decrease in the numbers of clusters of NI occurring in the new unit, indicating that cross-infections between infants were probably minimized.
TI  - Bacterial flora of clinically normal conjunctivae in the domestic duckling.
AB  - A total of 100 eyes from newly hatched and young domestic ducklings were swabbed  and the bacterial flora determined by standard bacteriological culture methods. Of the total number of bacteria isolated, 57% were gram negative suggesting that the majority were derived from the intestinal flora. Only 2% of the eyes sampled showed no bacterial growth. The bacterial species most commonly cultured were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter anitratus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, non-haemolytic Streptococci, micrococcus spp., a-haemolytic Streptococci and Acinetobacter lwoffii. More than one bacterial species was found in the majority of eyes. A. anitratus was isolated almost exclusively from 1 day old ducklings while A. lwoffii was mainly isolated from pen-reared ducklings. Chlamydia psittaci was not isolated from any of the conjunctivae sampled.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group B streptococci.
AB  - The relationship between significant bacteriuria (SB), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. From 30 (70%) of the 43 women with SB studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. The same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with Escherichia coli, the one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with Staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. Six of 10 patients with group B streptococci (GBS), 1 of 4 patients with Streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. Serotype III was isolated from 8/10 patients with SB caused by GBS. One child born to a woman with GBS SB but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. The poor predictive value of SB with GBS, S. faecalis and S. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), i.e. AB with bacteria in the urinary bladder. SB with GBS even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - The relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  - One potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. Between July 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean, elective arterial reconstructive procedures. Control cultures were obtained from adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. Positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0 of 20) (p less than 0.001). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). Our overall graft infection rate since January 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). All three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. Arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. Organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). These patients with culture-positive graft infections were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with negative arterial cultures. Positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). These data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.
TI  - Endogenous infection in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. A feature of bacterial translocation.
AB  - Slc:ddY mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) were examined for persistency of diabetes (changes of indigenous bacterial floras, and bacterial translocation. Significant diabetes (increase in plasma glucose and decrease in insulin) was recognized 2 weeks after the injection, and persisted for 12 weeks. The numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci (including micrococci), and streptococci in caecal and oral floras were significantly increased, but the numbers of anaerobic bacteria in caecal flora were hardly changed. Bacterial translocation of indigenous bacteria to the mesenteric lymph node, lung, or kidney was detectable in some mice 2 weeks after the injection. The incidence of bacterial translocation in these STZ-treated mice then increased; infection caused by several organisms, e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, or Lactobacillus sp., occurred in lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph node. No indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control mice. This endogenous infection may have been due to the over population of several bacterial strains caused by disruption of indigenous floras along with depression of immunological function.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - In vitro combination effects of cefotetan with four aminoglycosides, piperacillin and mezlocillin on gram-positive and gram-negative nosocomial bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro efficacy of cefotetan in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae and with piperacillin and mezlocillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter cloacae was compared by use of the checkerboard agar dilution technique. On average, 60% of the gram-negative and 46% of the gram-positive strains were inhibited by additive, but only 22% of the gram-negative and 2% of the gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by synergistic cefotetan-aminoglycoside combinations. Netilmicin combinations were least active. On gram-negative bacteria, 63% of the cefotetan-penicillin combinations were additive and 11% synergistic. No antagonism occurred with any of the combinations.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Antibacterial activity studies of flavonoids from Salvia palaestina.
AB  - Ten aglycones and six glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were identified from the leaves of Salvia palaestina Bentham (Labiatae). Among them cirsimaritin showed a high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the others have little or no activity against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  - Since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Alcaligenes faecalis, Neisseria meningitidis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. Addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. However, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). Ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. Growth in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). Addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. The results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine and the antimicrobial agents gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cefalothin, cefotiam and cefsulodin.
AB  - Synergy between the iron chelator deferoxamine in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid and gentamicin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, cefotiam or cefsulodin, used against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and species of Salmonella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Providencia, was determined by measuring the effect of the drugs and combination of drugs on growth of the bacteria in an automated turbidimeter. The combination of drugs was considered to be synergistic when the growth inhibiting effect of the combination was greater than that of the combined action of each of the drugs separately. Deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid together with either gentamicin or cefsulodin showed synergy in 10 out of 10, and 5 out of 6 cultures respectively, whereas deferoxamine plus ascorbic acid with chloramphenicol, cephalothin or cefotiam was synergistic in 6 out of 14, 5 out of 11, and 3 out of 6 cultures. This synergistic effect was much lower when microorganisms were incubated with deferoxamine combined with the various antibiotics but without ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid alone had no synergistic effect. When deferoxamine was saturated with iron, its antibacterial effect was completely abolished.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in intensive care unit areas.
AB  - The incidence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance rates of nosocomial pathogens vary considerably among countries and even among intensive care units (ICUs) within one hospital. Such differences might be partly due to the selection pressure exerted by certain antibiotics, since intensive care patients are given more antimicrobials than any other group of patients. We therefore compared resistance rates of four important nosocomial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients in general wards and ICUs. There were few trends toward higher resistance of ICU isolates, and most differences were found with Klebsiella pneumoniae. We also tried to relate antibiotic use in ICUs and frequency of antibiotic resistance of five selected nosocomial pathogens. The ampicillin and cephalosporin resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae arose along with an increase in usage of both drugs. Decreasing prescription of cotrimoxazole was not reflected by decrease in resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Increasing prescriptions of tetracyclines were followed by an increasing resistance of E. coli, but not of Staphylococci. The oxacillin resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis almost paralleled the consumption, the opposite was true for Staphylococcus aureus. There seemed to be a rather close relationship between the incidence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and the quantities of gentamicin, tobramycin and azlocillin prescribed. The increase or decrease of prescriptions of certain antimicrobials increased or decreased their resistance rate to the respective drugs of only certain bacterial strains in one ICU, but not in the other. The findings in our hospital cannot necessarily be applied to other hospitals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefodizime, an aminothiazolyl iminomethoxy cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin similar to moxalactam and ceftazidime, was less active (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.6 to 12 micrograms) than cefazolin or cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It inhibited Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. at less than 0.5 microgram/ml. It did not inhibit methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, or Listeria spp. and was 8- to 32-fold less active than cefotaxime, moxalactam, or ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia spp., and Serratia spp. Cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris were resistant to cefodizime. Cefodizime was less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. Cefodizime was not hydrolyzed by common plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases, and it inhibited type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Aerobic urethral flora of women with infertility and gynecologic problems.
AB  - One hundred eighty-five urine specimens were collected from an unselected group of non-gravid Nigerian women patients attending the infertility and gynaecologic clinics in Ile-Ife, Nigeria to investigate the aerobic urethral microflora. The specimens revealed that 25.9% of the total collected and processed contained bacteria flora. The most common aerobes isolated were Escherichia coli, P. mirabilis and S. epidermidis, in that order. The study has shown that there are changes in the urethral microflora from one physiologic age group to the other and that colonization of the urethral and urinogenital tract is important in the development of urinary tract infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - The clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. I. Laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  - Five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. After antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Infection and T lymphocyte subpopulations: changes associated with bacteremia and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Patients with bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were prospectively studied using monoclonal antibody reagents to assess alterations in T-lymphocyte subpopulations. Patients with endocarditis had significantly higher ratios of T-helper (OKT4+) to T-suppressor-cytotoxic (OKT8+) cells than did patients with bacteremia alone. Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis patients had a mean ratio of 8.49 (range 4.73-22.36) while S aureus bacteremia had a mean ratio of 2.75 (range 2.15 to 3.21). Similar results were found with Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis (mean 1.62) and bacteremia (mean 1.23). Klebsiella pneumoniae endocarditis (5.10) and sepsis (4.32), and E coli bacteremia (2.15). Nine male patients with AIDS had markedly depressed ratios (mean 0.25, range 0.04 to 0.67) while eight male homosexuals with unexplained lymphadenopathy ("pre-AIDS") had normal or increased ratios. Bacteremic infections are associated with an increased OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio with the degree of increase dependent upon virulence, location, and duration of infection. The immunomodulating effects of infection are manifested in changes in T-cell subsets, and these measurements can be useful in clinical management.
TI  - Detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. To determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. Each of six bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. Blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. Gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and MacConkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. However, subcultures onto Sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with P. aeruginosa). In a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with C. albicans and bacteremia with P. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.
TI  - Broviac catheter-related bacteremia in oncology patients.
AB  - In 27 pediatric oncology patients (median age, 2 years) undergoing chemotherapy for malignant tumours, Silastic Broviac catheters were placed to provide vascular access. The catheters were in place for a total of 174 patient-months. There were 14 episodes of Broviac catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia that occurred in six patients: one patient had six bacteremic episodes, one patient had four episodes, and four patients each had one bacteremic episode. Cultures of blood drawn from Broviac catheter were positive in all instances, and in 12 of 14 samples drawn from the peripheral vein. The most common initial symptoms were fever and chills. The species causing the infections were Enterobacter cloacae (three cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three cases), Staphylococcus aureus (three cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two cases), Escherichia coli (two cases), Pseudomonas dentrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis. Antimicrobials administered through the catheter cured the infection in ten of the 11 cases in which they were used.
TI  - [Treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid of urinary tract infections in patients with spinal injuries].
AB  - Augmentin, a formulation of amoxycillin trihydrate 250 mg and sodium clavulanate  125 mg per tablet (A-CS) (Augmentin; Beecham), was used in treating 29 episodes of urinary tract infection occurring in 26 patients admitted to the Spinal Unit of the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital, Pretoria. Patients who had a urinary bacterial cell count of more than 105 of the same amoxycillin-resistant organism before and after the oral administration of amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 48 hours, received 2 A-CS 375 mg tablets orally, 3 times a day at the start if a meal for 5 days. The 29 strains of amoxycillin-resistant organisms treated in this study were: Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter cloacae (2), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The bacteriological success rate 24 hours after therapy was 100% and 8 days after therapy 69%, dependent on patient management. In patients on free drainage and managed with condoms a bacteriological success rate of 55,5% was recorded and in patients managed by intermittent catheterization a bacteriological success rate of 75% was recorded. Side-effects were minimal; 1 patient complained of dizziness and no instances of nausea or vomiting were reported. Haematological, renal and hepatic monitoring before and after A-CS-therapy revealed no drug-related toxicity.
TI  - Blood culture cross contamination associated with a radiometric analyzer.
AB  - During a 9-day period in August 1980 in a New Jersey hospital, three pairs of consecutively numbered blood cultures from different patients were identified as positive for the same organism (two pairs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of group A Streptococcus), for each pair, both cultures were positive in the same atmosphere, both organisms had the same sensitivities, and the second of each pair grew at least 2 days after the first and was the only positive blood culture obtained from the patient. When the hospital laboratory discontinued use of its radiometric culture analyzer for 15 days, no more consecutive pairs of positive cultures occurred. Subsequent use of the machine for 9 days with a new power unit but the original circuit boards resulted in one more similar consecutive pair (Staphylococcus epidermidis). After replacement of the entire power unit, there were no further such pairs. Examination of the machine by the manufacturer revealed a defective circuit board which resulted in inadequate needle sterilization. Laboratories which utilize radiometric analyzers should be aware of the potential for cross contamination. Recognition of such events requires alert microbiologists and infection control practitioners and a record system in the bacteriology laboratory designed to identify such clusters.
TI  - Routine subcultures shown to be unnecessary in radiometric detection of bacteremia using three media.
AB  - A study to determine the necessity of routine blind subcultures when using the radiometric BACTEC-460 instrument for detection of bacteremia was conducted. In the first phase, blind subcultures were performed on day 10 of incubation; in the second phase, blind subcultures were performed on day 4; in the final phase the subculture was performed on day one. During the study, 6,208 blood cultures from 2,455 patients were inoculated into three different culture media. There were 454 microbial isolates recovered, including 269 presumed pathogenic isolates. The single significant discrepancy between blind subculture and radiometric detection was a case of Staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia in which the organism was detected 48 hours earlier by blind subculture. There were no cultures in which significant bacterial isolates were detected by blind subcultures but not radiometrically. Thus, under the conditions of this study, routine blind subcultures are not necessary when using the BACTEC radiometric system for detection of bacteremia.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Role of lymphatic vessels in bacterial clearance from early soft-tissue infection.
AB  - A popular concept regarding the pathophysiologic characteristics of infection is  that early bacterial clearance from tissue is an important host defense mechanism. Staphylococcus aureus, S epidermidis, Escherichia coli, enterococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were radiolabeled with tritiated thymidine and injected subcutaneously into rabbit ears. Negligible clearance occurred at five hours, and less than 30% of injected bacteria cleared in 24 hours. Lymphatic function measured by clearance with bovine serum albumin labeled with iodine 125 was normal at all times during the first 24 hours. Clearance of live S aureus, radiolabeled by tritiated thymidine, was not accelerated by preexisting 12- or 24-hour hold-old inflammatory lesions. Clearance of bacteria rendered nonviable in vitro by antibiotics and heat were cleared in proportion to the degree of bacterial cell lysis. Bacterial clearance of S aureus correlated with the rate of bacterial lysis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that lymphatic clearance of bacteria from soft tissues is of negligible importance as a host defense mechanism in the decisive period of soft-tissue infection.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - The susceptibility of nosocomial pathogens to ceftazidime.
AB  - The activities in vitro of ceftazidime and of cefuroxime have been compared against 201 strains of bacteria which had been isolated either from outbreaks of nosocomial infection or were typical of strains causing such outbreaks. Ceftazidime was found to be about 1000 times more active against Pseudomonas spp. and Proteus vulgaris, and between 10 and 100 times more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus morganii, Providencia stuartii, Alcaligenes faecalis and Acinetobacter spp. On the other hand, cefuroxime was more active against Staphylococcus epidermidis. An increase in inoculum size to 106 had little effect on the activity of ceftazidime, except in the case of Pr. vulgaris strains, which grew, although only to a very limited extent, even in the presence of high concentrations of ceftazidime. Anaerobic and hypercapnic conditions did not adversely affect the activity of ceftazidime. Our in-vitro results thus indicate that ceftazidime had as broad a spectrum as gentamicin, and is more intrinsically active.
TI  - [Epidemiology of nosocomial septicemia (author's transl)].
AB  - During recent decades the incidence of nosocomial septicemia has considerably increased. From 1976--1980 on average 0.6% of 39, 802 prospectively analyzed hospital patients acquired septicemia. The risk of acquiring nosocomial septicemia in intensive care units is 10 times higher than in general wards. The risk is highest in medical and surgical intensive care units. Most common bacteria causing nosocomial septicemia were: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nosocomial pneumonia, wound infections and venous catheter infections most often lead to septicemia. In half the patients with septicemia the infection either directly caused death or contributed to the death of the patient. The hospital costs for patients with septicemia are twice as high as for patients with the same underlying disease without septicemia.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - Comparison of gentamicin bioassay values utilizing three different indicator organisms.
AB  - Gentamicin serum concentrations were monitored via bioassay with three indicators, to determine if assay results were influenced by the testing organism. When mean assay values, from seven samples, were compared to mean target values, there was no significant differences with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis or Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, levels from one of the seven samples yield dramatically lower concentrations, for all three indicators, than the target. This suggests the presence of a bioassay inhibitor substance. Additional testing of the organisms, versus serum without gentamicin, revealed Bacillus subtilis to be much more serum-sensitive than the others.
TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - Is there a specific stimulus of infectious-allergic bronchial asthma?
AB  - 1. Pigmented Neisseria species (Neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca) are constant inhabitants of patients with infectious asthma. 2. Of all the diverse bronchial microflora of patients with infectious-allergic bronchial asthma, the pigmented Neisseria species (Neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca), Staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis), Klebsiella (Klebsiella pneumoniae) are active sensitizers of the human broncho-pulmonary tract. 3. Neisseria strains, possessing similar antigenic determinants to human lung tissues, possess the highest allergenic activity. This raises the question of a new criterion for evaluating the allergenicity of cultures according to their antigenic characteristics. 4. In patients with infectious asthma allergy might develop to some of the structures of microbial cells, in which antigenic determinants, similar to human lung tissues are localized.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Effects of intestinal micro-organisms on fluid and electrolyte transport in the jejunum of the rat.
AB  - Culture filtrates of micro-organisms isolated from the upper intestinal secretions of malnourished children and grown in pure culture were shown to impair the intestinal absorption of water and electrolytes in live rats. Decreased net movement out of the intestinal lumen, or actual secretion of water, sodium or potassium into the intestinal lumen, was found with culture filtrates of single isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli 055, Escherichia coli B7A, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. These organisms have been found to contaminate upper intestinal secretions in malnourished children and it is suggested that the effects observed in these experiments might be relevant to the production of the diarrhoea that is a dominant clinical feature of childhood malnutrition.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - Studies on the immune response in chickens I. Effect of various immunization procedures on the primary and secondary antibody responses to bovine serum albumin.
AB  - Antibody response and generation of immunological memory in chickens after stimulation by bovine serum albumin (BSA) were investigated. A single intravenous injection of BSA induced a relatively high primary antibody response but failed to generate definite memory for the secondary antibody response. Variation in antigen dosage and the time interval between antigen injections did not affect significantly the levels of the primary and secondary antibody responses. The immunogenicity of deaggregated BSA in chickens was as potent as that of aggregated BSA. Soluble adjuvants such as the capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae, cell wall lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella enteritidis and cell wall peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited little enhancing effect on antibody response and memory. However, stimulation of chickens by BSA emulsified in Freund's adjuvant enhanced generation of memory. Repeated injection of BSA alone also showed a similar effect. It seems likely therefore that in chickens continous antigenic stimulation is required for generation of definite memory. From the present results it has been concluded that the characteristics of the immune response of chickens to BSA resemble those of mammals to T-independent antigens.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in materials from patients with nonspecific odontogenic infections].
AB  - The results of bacteriological studies made between 1964 and 1971 by workers at the Varia Laboratory, Institute of Medical Microbiology on 767 patients treated at the Clinic of Gnathofacial Surgery, Department of Medicine, Friedrich Schiller University at Jena, are evaluated. The testees (x=275) were included in groups with specific diagnoses, and a breakdown was made according to the detection of aerobic pus-forming germs. Gram-positive cocci were detected in 92% of the cases and their pathogenetic representatives, 76,5% of the cases. Rodshaped germs (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas) were observed only in 37,9% of the cases. Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 62,5%, was the most frequently observed species. It was followed, in order of frequency of detection, by greening streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Monoinfection was far more frequently observed than multi-infection. Also, the problems associated with the differentiation of streptococci are pointed out since other investigators found streptococci to be the most frequent agents producing odontogenic infections.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (BB-K8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)Antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, various groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) Amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) On many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large MIC against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small MIC against amikacin.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
