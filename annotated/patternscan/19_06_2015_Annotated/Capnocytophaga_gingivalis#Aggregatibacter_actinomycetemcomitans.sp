TI  == evaluation of a new oral health scale of infectious potential based on the salivary microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. patients and methods: the oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. results: in comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., fusobacterium spp. and prevotella gingivalis). in comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (cfu/ml log10) of facultative  anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (s. mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter spp. and fusobacterium spp.). conclusion: our  new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and  quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the  saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. clinical relevance: our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus reuteri-containing tablets on the subgingival and salivary microbiota in patients with gingivitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of an orally administered probiotic on the  oral microbiota. methods: a placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 40 gingivitis subjects during 8 weeks. treatment consisted on the administration  of a daily tablet, either containing lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. unstimulated saliva and subgingival samples were collected and analysed by culture and pcr. clinical and microbiological outcome variables were compared between and within groups. results: there were no significant changes between and within the groups in the clinical variables. in saliva, total anaerobic counts after 4 weeks (p = 0.021) and counts of prevotella intermedia after 8 weeks (p =  0.030), showed reductions in the test group. in subgingival samples, significant  reductions in the changes baseline to 4 weeks were observed for p. gingivalis counts (p = 0.008). with pcr, l. reuteri atcc-pta-5289 was more frequently detected than l. reuteri dsm-17938. conclusions: the effect of l. reuteri administered in tablets resulted in a reduction in the number of selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microbiota, without an associated clinical impact.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface of  an external-hex implant after saliva incubation.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface under unloaded conditions. twelve premachined abutments with plastic sleeves and 12 dental implants were used in this study. prior to tests of bacterial leakage, samples from the inner parts of the implants were collected with sterile microbrushes to serve as negative controls for contamination. after casting, the abutments were tightened to 32 ncm on the implants. the assemblies were immersed in 2.0 ml of human saliva and incubated for 7 days. after this period, possible contamination of the internal parts of the implants was evaluated using the dna checkerboard method. microorganisms were found in the internal surfaces of all the implants evaluated. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga gingivalis were the most incident species. no microorganisms were found in the samples recovered from the implants  before contamination testing (negative control). bacterial species from human saliva may penetrate the implant-abutment interface under unloaded conditions.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == il6 -174 genotype associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in indians.
AB  == aim: genetic factors have recently been associated with presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans subgingivally in populations living in industrialized countries. the aim of this study was to analyse associations between interleukin-6 (il6) single nucleotide polymorphisms and presence and levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and other subgingival microbes in a rural indian population. subjects and methods: a total of 251 individuals from a rural  village in india with a periodontal phenotype ranging from healthy to severe periodontitis were included. checkerboard dna-dna analysis was performed to detect 40 periodontal taxa in subgingival plaque samples. genomic dna was extracted to genotype five polymorphisms in the il6 promoter region. results: the il6-74 gg genotype was associated with high (above median) counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans (both in all subjects and in periodontally healthy only) and with presence and counts of capnocytophaga sputigena. differences in detection of several other bacteria were noted between periodontitis and healthy  subjects. conclusions: these findings support the influence of genetic factors on the subgingival microbiota.

TI  == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover  of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard dna hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this  study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == serum phenytoin concentration and igg antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == subgingival microflora and antibody responses against periodontal bacteria of young japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == periodontal disease is a complication of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm), although the mechanisms responsible for this relationship remain unclear. the aim of this study was to examine oral manifestations and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from subgingival plaque samples and serum igg antibody levels against them in young japanese type 1 diabetic subjects. one hundred and seventeen japanese t1dm subjects (53 male, 64 female, mean age +/- sd, 16 +/- 6.5 years) participated in this study. thirty-nine periodontally healthy, age-matched nondiabetics served as controls. t1dm subjects were clinically assigned into three groups: 12 periodontitis, 32 gingivitis and 73 periodontally healthy. microbiological tests for four periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea were performed using 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction methods. serum igg antibody levels against 12 periodontal bacteria including the  four species assessed by polymerase chain reaction were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in the t1dm subjects, the periodontitis group had a significantly longer mean duration of diabetes and a higher percentages of subjects harbouring p. gingivalis and p. intermedia than the periodontally healthy group. serum igg antibody levels against p. gingivalis were significantly elevated in the periodontitis group compared with gingivitis and periodontally healthy groups. these results indicate that japanese t1dm subjects are a high-risk group for periodontal disease and both p. gingivalis infection and duration of t1dm are risk factors for the progression of periodontitis in patients with t1dm.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

AB  == the aim of this study was to longitudinally follow up osseointegrated titanium implants in partially dentate patients by clinical, radiographic and microbiological parameters in order to evaluate possible changes in the peri-implant health over time. fifteen individuals treated with titanium implants, ad modum branemark, and followed for ten years were included in the study. before implant placement ten years previously, the individuals had been treated for advanced periodontal disease and thereafter been included in a maintenance care program. the survival rate of the implants after ten years was 94.7%. the bone loss was 1.7 mm when using the abutment-fixture junction as a reference point. of the individuals, 50% were positive for plaque at the implants. bleeding on sulcus probing was present at 61% of the implant surfaces.  ten years previously, the individuals had been carriers of putative periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and campylobacter rectus, and were also carriers of these species at the current examination. the results of the present study suggest that the presence of these putative periodontal pathogens at implants may not be associated with an impaired implant  treatment. these species are most likely part of the normal resident microbiota of most individuals and may therefore be found at random at both stable and progressing peri-implant sites.

AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

AB  == it has been reported in the literature that certain species of bacteria (periodontopathogens) present in the subgingival plaque are associated with destructive periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the presence and proportional distribution of periodontopathogens in the  subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions. thirty adult patients with anterior dental crowding were selected from the orthodontic clinic of the university of pennsylvania. after orthodontic records were taken and the periodontal examination was performed, subgingival plaque samples were collected from crowded (experimental) and contralateral non-crowded regions (control) of each patient. the presence of 9 periodontopathic species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus, was determined using culture and immunofluorescence techniques. the bacterial morphotype was also determined by the use of dark-field microscopy. it was found  that supragingival plaque accumulation in crowded regions was significantly greater than in non-crowded regions. analysis of the bacteria showed that the samples from crowded regions consistently contained more species of periodontopathogens than the samples from non-crowded regions. morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in the crowded-region samples. in terms of the presence of individual periodontopathogens, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were significantly more common in  the crowded samples than in the non-crowded samples. it was concluded that: (1) more plaque accumulated in crowded areas; (2) more species of periodontopathogens were present in the subgingival plaque of crowded regions; (3) morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in crowded areas; and (4) fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were present more often in crowded areas than in non-crowded areas (p < 0.05).

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. methods: a total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (imp) were received at the microbiology testing laboratory (mtl) of the university of pennsylvania over a 2-year period. paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by mtl from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (ap) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (rp). patients'  mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. culture was used for detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, p. micros, capnocytophaga and  fusobacterium sp., enteric gram-negative rods, enterococcus and staphylococcus sp., and yeast. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. results: the most frequently detected microorganisms from imp were b. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), fusobacterium (41%), p. micros (39%), and p. gingivalis (27%). recovery levels (mean +/- sd) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. the most frequently detected organisms for ap were b. forsythus (83%), fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), p. gingivalis (59%), p. micros (51%), and e. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. corresponding data for rp were b. forsythus (85%), fusobacterium (83%), p. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), c. rectus (56%), and p. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively.  conclusions: these results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.

TI  == changes of periodontal status in patients with down syndrome during a 7-year period.
AB  == the development of periodontal disease in down syndrome adolescents (n = 34) was  studied clinically and on intraoral radiographs during a 7-yr period. the occurrence of gingival inflammation (gbi), pathological periodontal pockets (>4 mm), sub- and supragingival calculus, alveolar bone height, alveolar bone loss, and the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga, and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque were determined. of the subjects, 41% had one or more pathological periodontal pockets at baseline compared to 65% at follow-up. at the baseline examination, 35% of the individuals exhibited alveolar bone loss compared to 74% at the follow-up. the median value of sites with alveolar bone loss increased from 0 to 1, the new lesions mainly being located in the incisor region. the estimated annual reduction of alveolar bone height in each subject was 0.04 mm on average. the occurrence of the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga, and p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque did not differ between baseline and follow-up. the results of the present study indicate that the frequency of periodontitis, mainly located on the lower incisors, markedly increased during a 7-yr period in down syndrome individuals, although the severity and progression was limited compared to what has previously been described.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == subgingival microflora and treatment in prepubertal periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia.
AB  == prepubertal periodontitis affects both primary and permanent dentition. the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival microflora of the permanent dentition in an 11-year-old caucasian female, who had premature exfoliation of her deciduous teeth on her 5th year of age, and the response of this condition to the antibiotic therapy and supportive periodontal care. gingival tissues were highly inflamed and alveolar bone loss was detected radiographically. the girl had experienced frequent upper respiratory tract infections, tonsilitis and recurrent otitis media. her mother had history of early onset periodontitis associated with chronic idiopathic neutropenia. blood chemistry tests and immunological examinations were also performed. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the proximal sites of permanent molars, incisors, canines and maxillary premolars. 27 different microbial species were isolated from the subgingival microflora. among the predominant species were porphyromonas gingivalis (17.6%-7.3%), prevotella intermedia (12.4%-4.7%), capnocytophaga sputigena (14.4%-10.4%), capnocytophaga ochracea (13.2%-6.9%) and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.3%-5.5%). periodontal treatment consisted of scaling, root planing in conjunction with antibiotic administration of augmentin 312.5 mg and flagyl 200 mg, each t.i.d. for 10 days. 3 weeks after the  antibiotic therapy, bacterial samples were collected from the same sites. all the periodontal pathogens were recovered in lower levels and a.actinomycetemcomitans  was almost eliminated in the 3-week period. the evaluation of clinical indices at 3, 6 and 12 months showed that periodontal treatment in conjunction with antibiotics was effective and rapidly followed by marked clinical improvement. the microbiological monitoring at 3, 6 and 12 months after antibiotic treatment and each time prior to supportive periodontal care, revealed that the periodontal pathogens fluctuated in low levels even 12 months after treatment and could be maintained at low level by supportive periodontal care at 3-month intervals.

AB  == the aim of the present trial was to study the effect of meticulous supragingival  plaque control on (i) the subgingival microbiota, and (ii) the rate of progression of attachment loss in subjects with advanced periodontal disease. an  intra-individual group of sites exposed to non-surgical periodontal therapy served as controls. 12 patients with advanced periodontal disease were subjected  to a baseline examination (bl) including assessments of oral hygiene status, gingival condition (bop), probing depth, clinical attachment level and subgingival microbiota from pooled samples from each quadrant. the assessments were repeated after 12, 24 and 36 months. following bl, a split mouth study was initiated. the patients received oral hygiene instruction, supragingival scaling  and case presentation. 2 quadrants in each patient were identified as "test" and  the remaining 2 as "control" quadrants. subgingival therapy was performed in all  bleeding sites in the control quadrants. oral hygiene instructions and plaque control exercises were repeated once every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of the study. thereafter the plaque control program was repeated once every 3 months for the duration of the 3 years. sites demonstrating loss of clinical attachment  > or =2 mm in the test quadrants were treated subgingivally. the results showed that in both test and control quadrants repeated oral hygiene instructions and supragingival plaque removal procedures resulted in low plaque scores throughout  the study. the gingival bleeding scores and the frequency of periodontal pockets  > or =4 mm was, however, significantly higher in the test quadrants than in the control quadrants. at the end of the 3 year study, the control quadrants showed significantly more reduced (> or =2 mm) pockets than the test quadrants, 265 versus 96. the number of sites in the test quadrants showing probing attachment loss > or =2 mm was more than 4x greater than in the control quadrants (59 versus 13). the microbiological findings indicate a more pronounced reduction only for p. gingivalis in the control quadrants. none of the other 4 marker bacteria consistently reflected or predicted the clinical parameters. the present study shows that only supragingival plaque control fails to prevent further periodontal tissue destruction in subjects with advanced periodontal disease.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

AB  == this study examined for 3 years the changes in periodontal status and the possible correlations with selected subgingival microbiota and diabetic conditions in a group of 16 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm, jd) patients as compared with their 16 healthy cohabiting siblings (hs). jd patients  were monitored every 3 months for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (hba1c). clinical and microbiological parameters were measured 6 weeks before drawing blood to determine levels of hba1c. periodontal parameters were measured at baseline (to), year 2 (t2), year 3 (t3) and included: probing depth (pd), attachment level (al), sulcus bleeding index (sbi), and plaque index (pi). two sites in each patient were selected for microbial samples: a mesio-facial aspect  of the maxillary right first molar (defined as constant site, cs) and a site with the greatest probing depth (defined as deepest site, ds). microbial samples were  analyzed by culture techniques. no significant differences in clinical parameters were found between diabetics and healthy siblings at any examination. the sbi in  the non-diabetic group at t2 and at t3 was significantly lower than at baseline.  pd and al of constant sites in the diabetic group at t3 were significantly higher than baseline. there was a significant increase in prevotella intermedia at t3 as compared with baseline for deepest sites in the diabetic group. cluster analysis  revealed, in a former study, two clusters (iv and v) at baseline which were significantly different from the overall mean regarding composition of porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga spp. they were not significantly different for periodontal parameters from to to t3. these data would suggest no significant differences in clinical parameters between the diabetics and non-diabetic siblings throughout this 3-year longitudinal study.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

TI  == characterization of protease activities in capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == rheumatoid factor from periodontitis patients cross-reacts with epitopes on oral  bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the antigenic specificity of rheumatoid factor (rf) that had previously been reported in the serum of patients with periodontitis. design: igm-rf was isolated from the serum  of five rf-seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients and 14 rf-seropositive periodontitis and examined for specificity to human igg and selected oral bacteria. methods: igm-rf was prepared by affinity chromatography on human igg columns. human igg antibody to capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated by binding and elution of antibody from the bacteria, followed by purification using a rabbit anti-igg affinity column. main outcome measure: binding of the isolated igm-rf was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the antigens used for detection of binding included isolated human igg, human igg antibody bound to the bacteria, and the bacteria alone. inhibition of the igm-rf binding with igg or fc gamma was used to assess the specificity of the reactivity with igg and/or the bacteria. results: the results showed that the igm-rf reacted with polyclonal human igg nonspecifically bound to microtiter plates. the reactivity of the igm-rf was increased when incubated with igg that bound as antibody to c.  gingivalis, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans. however, the igm-rf did not bind with increased intensity to the specific igg antibody preparations or to igg preparations lacking antibody to these micro-organisms. additionally, the igm-rf  preparations bound to surface components of both c. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.  blocking studies showed that fc gamma but not igg inhibited igm-rf binding to both micro-organisms. conclusions: these findings indicate that the rf detected in the serum of some periodontitis patients may be elicited by certain micro-organisms in the subgingival plaque. furthermore, c. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appear to express surface antigen epitopes that are antigenically related to determinants on igg can induce cross-reactive igm-rf.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor production.
AB  == to determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (il-6) and soluble il-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure t cells, or monocytes were cultured with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis for  24 h. supernatants were tested for il-6 and soluble il-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant il-6 release in the presence of all  bacteria tested. however, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing  il-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or il-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. no bacteria tested increased soluble il-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble il-6 receptor release. we conclude that monocytes release il-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble il-6 receptor from t cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate il-6 actions.

TI  == serum rheumatoid factor induced by intraperitoneal administration of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharide in mice.
AB  == serum rheumatoid factor (rf) level and peritoneal and splenic cd5+b (b-1) cells in mice were examined after intraperitoneal administration of purified lipopoly-saccharides (lps) from oral periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga ochracea. f. nucleatum and c. ochracea lps induced higher levels of serum igm- and igg-rf, while p. gingivalis lps showed the least induction. in  addition, wet weights of spleen and serum igm and igg concentration were markedly increased in f. nucleatum lps injected group. on the other hand, the proportion of cd5+ b cells to lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity and spleen did not increase. the reason for this was not clear but conventional b cells (cd5- b cells) might increase more rapidly with splenic enlargement than cd5+ b cells. these results suggested that rf induced by bacterial lps may modulate immune responses against bacteria and plays an important role for defence and destruction of periodontal tissue.

TI  == pcr reaction and dot-blot hybridization to monitor the distribution of oral pathogens within plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of the putative periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, the three oral capnocytophaga species (c. ochracea, c. sputigena, c. gingivalis), as well as porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in plaque samples of periodontally healthy individuals. we chose a newly developed 16s rdna directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and a previously described dot-blot hybridization assay to detect, differentiate, and quantify these bacteria directly in clinical samples. the subjects of these investigations were 66 sulcus fluid samples from 17 children (ages 3 to 5) attending a kindergarten, 48 sulcus  fluid samples from 12 children (ages 9 and 10) from a primary school, and 25 subgingival plaque samples isolated from 6 different periodontally healthy dental students (ages 24 to 27). we were able to demonstrate the presence of p. nigrescens in 54 (kindergarten: 5; primary school: 33; students: 16) samples by pcr and quantified it by dot-blot hybridization. in addition, we found c. ochracea in 12 (kindergarten: 2; primary school: 10) samples by pcr reaction only. the other tested bacterial species were absent by the methods used. furthermore we confirmed the specificity of our p. nigrescens-pcr in selected samples by enzyme electrophoresis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == prevalence of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from romanian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form romanian adult periodontitis patients. dna probe  analysis (affirm dp microbial identification test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. the chi 2 test was  used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and dna analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. p. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans,  respectively. capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the west. the affirm dp test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting p.  gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus. the cultivation prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present romanian periodontitis patients is similar  to what has been revealed in matching norwegian and other western periodontitis patient populations. the high prevalence of enteric rods in the romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in vmga iii.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  == a total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. a subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. at baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2)  select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. there were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters  measured at the 7 different time points. the control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of p. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. after 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly veillonella dispar. this study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.

AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == effect of whole oral bacteria and extracted lipopolysaccharides on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.
AB  == expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) on t cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the g0 to g1 transition and is the critical first step for t cell proliferation in response to antigen. the effect of whole periodontal  bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) il-2r expression was examined in vitro. lps induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity il-2r alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on pbmc over untreated cells after 48 h culture. addition of lps to pbmc cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on il-2r expression compared to untreated cultures. interleukin-1 (il-1) caused a similar effect to lps in 48 h pbmc cultures but il-1 also increased high affinity il-2r expression in cultures  depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. when antibody to il-1 was simultaneously  added with lps to pbmc cultures, the high affinity il-2r inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the lps effect on pbmc il-2r was indirect, via  monocytes. whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with pbmc at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:pbmc ratios had a similar effect to lps, inducing high affinity il-2r expression at 48 h. increases in soluble il-2r alpha were also measured in supernatants of pbmc incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to  untreated controls. in this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate pbmc perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface lps presented to adherent mononuclear cells.

AB  == serum igg antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments  with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. all patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. after the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. serum igg antibody titers against sonicated antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381, prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, prevotella loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum atcc 25586, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, eikenella corrodens fdc 1073 and capnocytophaga ochracea # m 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean antibody titers to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. the antibody titer to p. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. a significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to p. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to p. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. these results suggest that the changes of serum igg titers against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.

AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. the material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. the bacterial species  studied (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured p. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. prevalence of p. gingivalis was associated  with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. in diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == predominant microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to study the microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions, in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). subgingival plaque samples were taken from 142 periodontal lesions in 10 young adults aging 25 to 35 years. the examination of the subgingival microflora indicated that certain species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were found to be predominant in  severe periodontal lesions. b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, were predominant in medium lesions while streptococcus species and actinomyces species, c. ochracea, haemophilus segnis and veillonella parvula, were found in higher levels in minimal periodontal lesions.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == comparative detection frequency of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in sudanese and norwegian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == twenty-five sudanese and 18 norwegian adult periodontitis patients were selected  to participate in this study. the purpose was to compare cultivation results of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in both populations. in addition, dna probe analysis was used to identify p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and bacteroides forsythus in the sudanese patients and results were compared with those obtained by cultivation. the paper point technique was used to sample 99 sites in the sudanese group (4 paper points/site) and 119 sites in the norwegian patients (3 paper points/site). in the sudanese subjects, the fourth paper point was used for the dna probe analysis. the chi-square test and the wilcoxon signed rank test were used to test for statistically significant differences between sudanese and norwegian cultivation results as well as between cultivation and dna results in the sudanese group. cultivation results indicated  that the sudanese subjects had significantly lower prevalence of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01), significantly higher prevalence of capnocytophaga species (p < 0.05), and similar prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. almost all sudanese subjects tested positive for various enteric rods, while none of the norwegians did so. the extent to which unrestricted use of antibiotics and transport media influenced the levels of enteric species is not known, however.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == a longitudinal microbiological study on osseointegrated titanium implants in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == the aim was to longitudinally follow the colonization of putative periodontal pathogens on titanium implants in partially edentulous patients. nineteen individuals, who were partially edentulous and were on the waiting-list to be treated with titanium fixtures, were included in the study. they were treated for periodontal disease with oral hygiene instructions and supra- and subgingival debridement and were left for maintenance. full-mouth recordings of each patient  were performed at baseline, including attachment level and probing pocket depth.  bleeding was provoked and visible plaque were registered. subgingival samples were taken for examination of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. bridge connection was completed 1 month after abutment connection. the bone level was registered on radiographs. the patients were followed with clinical registrations and subgingival samples at 6,  12, 24 and 36 months. no significant changes in pocket depth, attachment level, bleeding on probing or plaque score occurred during the experimental period. the  number of individuals positive at teeth and abutments for the various bacterial species reached approximately similar levels at 6 months. no significant changes  over time were seen. comparison between bone height, seen on radiographs, at abutments after 2, 12 and 36 months gave only 3 sites with bone loss of > 0.5 mm. all these sites were found in one patient and were accompanied by p. intermedia.

TI  == microbial associations in periodontitis sites before and after treatment.
AB  == duplicate samples from 110 periodontal sites of 6 mm or more pocket depth in 16 patients were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum. the sites  were sampled before and after nonsurgical periodontal treatment. no statistically significant associations were found before treatment between any of the analyzed  species. after treatment, statistically significant associations were found between e. corrodens and all the other species, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia; capnocytophaga spp. and c. rectus; p. intermedia vs capnocytophaga spp. and p. gingivalis; and c. rectus vs capnocytophaga spp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans. some of these associations could be explained either by patient-related factors or site-related characteristics such as the pocket depth. the proportion of p. gingivalis seemed to be unrelated to the proportion of p. intermedia in the samples. if one of the analyzed microbes was found in one of the sampled pockets  in a patient, the probability of finding that microbe in all the sampled sites in the same patient before treatment was more than 50%. this probability was reduced after treatment for many species, especially p. gingivalis, which showed a probability of zero. the probability of detecting a bacterial species on at least one additional site if it was present on one in the same individual was nearly 100%, both before and after treatment, for all species studied. this study has shown several potential microbial associations in the subgingival plaque flora of deep periodontal pockets.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. a fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction  isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. these preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. growth of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. the gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. the effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia proving most sensitive. the gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. the action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == periodontal bone loss in mice induced by different periodontopathic organisms.
AB  == periodontal bone loss in mice orally inoculated with peptostreptococcus anaerobius, pept. magnus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was compared to that in sham-inoculated mice. six-to-8-week-old balb/c mice were inoculated with  1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria in 50 microliters of medium. ten mice received each concentration of bacteria and 10 sham-inoculated mice acted as controls. five mice from each of the groups were killed 6 weeks after inoculation and the remaining five mice at 12 weeks. right hemimandibles were defleshed, stained and bone loss was measured using an image analyser. all the organisms tested were associated with bone loss. animals that had received pept. anaerobius and pept. magnus had up to 18% more bone loss than  those sham inoculated. in contrast, mice inoculated with a. actinomycetemcomitans had up to 38% more bone loss than the sham-inoculated animals, this amount of loss occurring at the lowest inoculation of 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. these data demonstrate a differential ability of micro-organisms to cause periodontal bone loss in mice.

TI  == putative periodontopathogens in "diseased" and "non-diseased" persons exhibiting  poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of some putative periodonto-pathogens in "test" and "control" sites in "diseased" and "non-diseased" persons, respectively, from an adult rural kenyan population exhibiting poor oral hygiene and widespread loss of attachment (la). 14 persons (less than 35 years) were assigned to a "diseased" category on the basis of at least 4 sites with la greater than or equal to 4 mm; at least 5 mm la and a pocket greater than or equal to 4 mm interproximally in a lower incisor ("test" site): and less than 2 mm la and no pocket greater than or equal to 4 mm distal to a lower canine or mesial to a lower first premolar ("control" site). age-matched "non-diseased" persons were identified on the basis of no sites with  la greater than 2 mm and no pockets greater than or equal to 4 mm associated with la. paperpoint samples from test and control sites as well as a scraping sample from the dorsum of tongue were examined for presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, b. melaninogenicus group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas spp., and wolinella recta. p.  gingivalis was found in 79% of test sites and 36% of control sites in "diseased"  persons, and in 18% and 35% of test and control sites, respectively, in "non-diseased" persons. "no other bacterial group discriminated significantly between test and control sites or between diseased and non-diseased subjects. the surprisingly high occurrence of p. gingivalis in non-diseased subjects, both subgingivally and on tongue, indicates that deep periodontal pockets are not prerequisite ecological environments for p. gingivalis establishment.

TI  == the effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, listerine antiseptic (thymol), peridex (chlorhexidine), perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. at the baseline examination,  papillary bleeding score (pbs), and plaque index (pi) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. at day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (anova) to compare the 4 groups, followed by duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. at baseline, average pbs and pi scores were similar for all 4 groups. after 14 days, the average pbs for peridex and perimed was significantly  lower than for listerine antiseptic and water. the frequency of interdental units with a pbs greater than 2 was significantly lower for peridex and perimed than for listerine antiseptic and water. we concluded that both peridex and perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. in vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == clinical and microbiological patterns of adults with periodontitis.
AB  == although current data suggest that periodontitis may actually be multiple diseases each with varying responses to therapy, little evidence exists to support this theory in adult patients. this report describes the design and initial findings of a longitudinal field trial involving the diagnosis and treatment of adult and refractory periodontitis patients in private practice. adult patients (n = 221) who met specific clinical criteria were selected from the private practices of 22 periodontists. clinical characteristics were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were sent to microbiology laboratories at either ucla or the university of texas health science center at san antonio (uthscsa). samples were processed according to protocols standardized between the 2 centers. five different combinations of the initial clinical and microbial findings were evaluated for patterns in the data by means of cluster analysis. plaque, bleeding on probing, bone loss scores, probing depth distributions, and microbial findings produced multiple cluster solutions. solutions involving 6 clusters explained 39.4% to 76.4% of the variation between patients and produced ratios for variation between clusters to variation within clusters of 5.2 to 15.3. the optimal cluster solution incorporated both clinical and microbial findings, with  some clusters characterized by high plaque and moderate bleeding on probing and bone loss, whereas others had low plaque but high bleeding on probing and bone loss. microbial findings of each cluster exhibited distinct patterns with some clusters having a high prevalence (83% to 100%) of specific target bacterial species while other clusters had an absence of these species.(abstract truncated  at 250 words)

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.
