TI  == application of pcr-sscp for molecular epidemiological studies on the exposure of  farm children to bacteria in environmental dust.
AB  == the environmental exposure of farm children to microorganisms in dust has become  a focus of interest, since microbial exposure on farms has been related to a reduced prevalence of asthma and atopic diseases in children. previous studies almost exclusively focused on the determination of microbial counts using conventional culturing or the determination of microbial compounds i.e. endotoxins. in this study pcr-sscp (single-strand conformation polymorphism) was  modified for characterising bacterial communities in environmental dusts and their sensitivity and reproducibility was validated. a fivefold repeated pcr-sscp analyses of a well homogenised mattress dust, cow-shed dust, swine-shed dust, chicken-shed dust and a horse-shed dust sample, respectively, showed similarities, based on pearson correlations, ranging from 89.7% to 95.2%. the reproducibility of day to day variations (five days) and gel to gel variations (five gels) was also around 90%. the detection limit of escherichia coli was 7 x  10(1) cfu g(-1) whereas listeria monocytogenes and bacillus licheniformis containing 30% spores showed visible bands at 7 x1 0(2) cfu g(-1). application of this method to dust samples of 37 sheds and 63 children's mattresses showed that  distinct farm environment dusts reflected different sscp profiles. however, digital analysis of the gels showed that some bands in the profiles of shed- and  mattress dusts were found at the same position in the gels. by excision, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses, these bands were identified as corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, corynebacterium mucifaciens, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter lwoffii, brevibacterium iodinum, brevibacterium linens and arthrobacter spp, respectively. these results may reflect transfer of microorganisms from animal sheds to mattresses. in conclusion this study demonstrates that pcr-sscp is a promising method with sensitive detection limits  and moderate sample variances to be applied for epidemiological studies characterizing the exposure of farmers using environmental dust.

TI  == bacteremia in cirrhotic patients submitted to endoscopic band ligation of esophageal varices.
AB  == background: endoscopic procedures can develop bacteremia. patients with chronic liver disease are more predisposed to undergo bacteremia and infections because they are immunocompromised. aims: the purpose of this study was to determine the  incidence of bacteremia in cirrhotics submitted to endoscopic variceal ligation.  methods: three groups of 40 patients each were studied. one group was made up of  patients with cirrhosis who were submitted to ligation, a second group was composed of cirrhotics who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy only, and a third group was composed of patients without liver disease who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. blood was sampled from all patients for culture, both in aerobic and in anaerobic mediums, immediately before endoscopy and at 5 and 30 minutes after its completion. results: blood culture was positive in 6 samples. in 4 of these, the bacteria (staphylococcus hominis hominis, staphylococcus auricularis, acinetobacter lwoffii, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were isolated before the endoscopic procedure and thus were considered as contamination. in the ligation group, a streptococcus of the viridans group was isolated 5 minutes after the procedure, and in the cirrhosis without ligation group, a staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated at 30 minutes. none of the patients showed clinical evidence of infection. conclusions: the bacteremia incidence in cirrhotic patients submitted to variceal ligation was 2.5%, showing  no difference from the control groups.

TI  == a comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  == this prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals  in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (nicus).  the mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (p<0.0001). significantly more homemakers had acinetobacter lwoffii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. fluorescens/putida, and staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all p<0.05). however, significantly more nurses had enterococcus faecalis, s. epidermidis, and s. warneri on their hands (p<0.05). of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more s. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and s. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (p<0.05). surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant s. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant s. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (p<0.05). this study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.

TI  == effect of frequent-replacement contact lenses on normal conjunctival flora.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the effect of frequent-replacement contact lenses (frcl) on  the normal conjunctival flora. methods: this study included 30 patients using frcl for refractive errors only and 32 age-matched, healthy controls. all patients replaced their lenses every 3 to 4 weeks. the samples were taken from the lower fornix with a culture swab and incubated in blood agar. results: staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant organism found in the conjunctival samples in the two groups. in the frcl group, 9 (30%) s. epidermidis, 3 (10%) acinetobacter iwoffii, and 2 (6.7%) moraxella spp. were isolated from the conjunctival samples. in the control group, 7 (23.3%) s. epidermidis and 2 (6.7%) a. lwoffii were isolated from the conjunctival samples. there was no statistically significant difference between two groups (p > .05). conclusion: our results show that the normal conjunctival flora was not changed by the frcl,  but there was a nonsignificant increase in the bacterial population.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [a clinical evaluation of sultamicillin fine granules in the treatment of meibomianitis].
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. a dose of 375 mg sbtpc granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. the results obtained are summarized as follows. efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. no side effects were observed throughout the study. the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria such as  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative staphylococcus and streptococcus sanguis, and gram-negative bacteria such as alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, alcaligenes denitrificans subsp.  xylosoxidans, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter lwoffii. a bacteriological study showed lower mics of sbtpc than those of ampicillin (abpc), suggesting that sbtpc has more potent antibacterial activity than abpc. such bacteriological activity of sbtpc was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to abpc or cefaclor.

TI  == bacterial flora of clinically normal conjunctivae in the domestic duckling.
AB  == a total of 100 eyes from newly hatched and young domestic ducklings were swabbed  and the bacterial flora determined by standard bacteriological culture methods. of the total number of bacteria isolated, 57% were gram negative suggesting that  the majority were derived from the intestinal flora. only 2% of the eyes sampled  showed no bacterial growth. the bacterial species most commonly cultured were escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter anitratus, klebsiella pneumoniae, non-haemolytic streptococci, micrococcus spp., a-haemolytic streptococci and acinetobacter lwoffii. more than one bacterial species was found in the majority of eyes. a. anitratus was isolated almost exclusively from 1 day  old ducklings while a. lwoffii was mainly isolated from pen-reared ducklings. chlamydia psittaci was not isolated from any of the conjunctivae sampled.
