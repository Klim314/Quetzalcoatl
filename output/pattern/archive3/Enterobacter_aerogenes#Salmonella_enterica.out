combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml) and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.
the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria.
most bacteria possess the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase, which is used to produce branched-chain amino acids. enteric bacteria contain several isozymes suited to different conditions, but the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria is largely unknown. growth experiments confirmed that escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes contain isozymes of acetohydroxyacid synthase, allowing the bacteria to grow in the presence of valine (which causes feedback inhibition of ahas i) or the sulfonylurea herbicide triasulfuron (which inhibits ahas ii) although a slight lag phase was observed in growth in the latter case. several common soil isolates were inhibited by triasulfuron, but pseudomonas fluorescens and rhodococcus erythropolis were not inhibited by any combination of triasulfuron and valine. the extent of sulfonylurea-sensitive acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil was revealed when 21 out of 27 isolated bacteria in pure culture were inhibited by triasulfuron, the addition of isoleucine and/or valine reversing the effect in 19 cases. primers were designed to target the genes encoding the large subunits (ilvb, ilvg and ilvi) of acetohydroxyacid synthase from available sequence data and a approximately 355 bp fragment in bacillus subtilis, arthrobacter globiformis, e. coli and s. enterica was subsequently amplified. the primers were used to create a small clone library of sequences from an agricultural soil. phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequence variation, but all 19 amino acid sequences were most closely related to published large subunit acetohydroxyacid synthase amino acid sequences within several phyla including the proteobacteria and actinobacteria. the results suggested the majority of soil microorganisms contain only one functional acetohydroxyacid synthase enzyme sensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides.
