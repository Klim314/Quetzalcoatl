TI  - [Botulinum neurotoxin--a therapy in migraine].
AB  - Although migraine is a common, paroxysmal, highly disabling disorder, the primary cause and the pathomechanism of migraine attacks are enigmatic. Experimental results suggest that activation of the trigeminovascular system is crucial in its pathogenesis. This activation leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide - CGRP, and substance P - SP) and to neurogenic inflammation, and peripheral and central sensitisation are expressed. Botulinum neurotoxin-A (BoNT-A), a potent toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, affects the nervous system through specific cleavage of the soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor complex (SNARE), like synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). The result of this multistage process is blockade of the presynaptic release of pain neurotransmitters such as CGRP, SP and glutamate. A pooled analysis of the data from two programmes of Phase 3 Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT 1 and 2) with BoNT-A in chronic migraine demonstrated significant benefit of BoNT-A over placebo with regard to the numbers of headache days and migraine episodes. BoNT-A diminished the frequency of acute headache pain medication intake, and resulted in reductions in headache impact and improvements in scores on the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. The treatments with BoNT-A proved safe and were well tolerated.
TI  - Bostrycin, a novel coupling agent for protein immobilization and prevention of biomaterial-centered infection produced by Nigrospora sp. No. 407.
AB  - Bostrycin, a red antibacterial agent with tetrahydroanthraquinone structure, has  been isolated from Nigrospora sp. No. 407. This study investigated the potential antibacterial and multifunctional properties of matrixes through immobilization of bostrycin on their surface for immobilization of protein and prevention of bacterial growth. Bostrycin was immobilized on nonwoven polypropylene (PP) fabric by a technique using glutaraldehyde and polyethyleneimine for the activation of the surface. Glucose oxidase immobilized on bostrycin-treated nonwoven PP fabric showed high activity. The immobilization process improved thermal stability of the enzymes. During repeated assay for 30 cycles, the enzyme activity dropped to only 70% of the initial activity. Both bostrycin-treated nonwoven PP fabric sample and subsequently immobilized glucose oxidase sample on the surface also still exhibited a bacteriostatic effect. This is the first study to show that bostrycin is a promising coupling agent for surface modification on matrix and its potential applications in protein immobilization and biomaterial-centered infection.
TI  - Using temperature and time criteria to control the effectiveness of continuous thermal sanitation of piggery effluent in terms of set microbial indicators.
AB  - AIM: To determine the minimal conditions (temperature-time), necessary to achieve set sanitation targets for selected microbial indicators during the continuous thermal treatment of pig slurry. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effectiveness of thermal treatment between 55 and 96 degrees C was studied using Escherichia coli, enterococci, sulfite-reducing Clostridia (SRC), mesophilic culturable bacteria (MCB), F+-specific and somatic phages. Identification of SRC and MCB was performed using 16S rRNA gene analysis. Ten minutes at 70 degrees C or 1 h at 60 degrees C was sufficient to reduce the vegetative bacteria by 4-5 log(10), but it had little effect on somatic phages nor on spore formers, dominated by Clostridium sp. At 96 degrees C, somatic phages were still detected, but there was a reduction of 3.1 log(10) for SRC and of 1.4 log(10) for MCB. At 96 degrees C, Clostridium botulinum was identified among the thermotolerant MCB. CONCLUSION: Only those hygienic risks relating to mesophilic vegetative bacteria can be totally eliminated from pig slurry treated at 60 degrees C (60 min) or 70 degrees C (<10 min). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Hygiene standards based on the removal of the indicators E. coli and enterococci can easily be met by treatment as low as 60 degrees C (enabling, a low-cost treatment using heat recovery). However, even at 96 degrees C, certain pathogens may persist.
TI  - Botulism in Brazil, 2000-2008: epidemiology, clinical findings and laboratorial diagnosis.
AB  - Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal illness caused by Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin. We describe the findings of a laboratorial investigation of 117 suspected cases of botulism reported to the surveillance system in Brazil from January 2000 to October 2008. Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin. Among the clinical samples, 22 (11.4%) presented the toxin (nine type A, five type AB and eight with an unidentified type); in food samples, eight (9.9%) were positive for the toxin (five type A, one type AB and two with an unidentified type). Of the 38 cases of suspected botulism in Brazil, 27 were confirmed by a mouse bioassay. Laboratorial botulism diagnosis is an important procedure to elucidate cases, especially food-borne botulism, to confirm clinical diagnosis and to identify toxins in food, helping sanitary control measures.
TI  - Rho signaling pathway and apical constriction in the early lens placode.
AB  - Epithelial invagination in many model systems is driven by apical cell constriction, mediated by actin and myosin II contraction regulated by GTPase activity. Here we investigate apical constriction during chick lens placode invagination. Inhibition of actin polymerization and myosin II activity by cytochalasin D or blebbistatin prevents lens invagination. To further verify if lens placode invaginate through apical constriction, we analyzed the role of Rho-ROCK pathway. Rho GTPases expression at the apical portion of the lens placode occurs with the same dynamics as that of the cytoskeleton. Overexpression of the pan-Rho inhibitor C3 exotoxin abolished invagination and had a strong effect on apical myosin II enrichment and a mild effect on apical actin localization. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of ROCK activity interfered significantly with apical enrichment of both actin and myosin. These results suggest that apical constriction in lens invagination involves ROCK but apical concentration of actin and myosin are regulated through different pathways upstream of ROCK. genesis 49:368-379, 2011.
TI  - Clostridiolysin S, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - Through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, Clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. Using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in C. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen Clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin S, a key virulence factor from group A Streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. Genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin S-like gene cluster from Clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin S.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Development of an immunodetection test for a botulinum-like neurotoxin produced by Clostridium sp. RKD.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Clostridial neurotoxins are among the most toxic substances known and cause severe illnesses in both humans and animals. A neurotoxigenic Clostridium sp. (strain RKD) isolated from intestine of decaying fish produced a novel, botulinum type B like neurotoxin as suggested by mouse bioassay, protection with anti-botulinum antibodies and PCR. The aim of the present investigation was to develop a laboratory based detection assay as an alternative to the mouse bioassay without compromising sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: Growth and toxin production were carried out in trypticase peptone yeast-extract glucose (TPYG) broth. Toxicity was estimated in terms of minimum lethal dose (MLD) by mouse bioassay. The toxin was partially purified by acid precipitation. It was used for toxoid preparation by formaldehyde treatment. This purified IgG was used for detection of neurotoxin using indirect ELISA. The culture supernatant was concentrated using a stirred cell with a 50 kDa cut-off membrane at 4 degrees C. Further purification was carried out using Prep cell. Fractions showing toxicity and sufficient purity were pooled, concentrated and analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). RESULTS: The toxin was purified with a recovery of 8.56 per cent. Polyclonal antiserum was raised in mice using partially purified toxin with a titre of 1: 80000. A detection assay with sensitivity of approximately 15 and 300 ng/ml for partially purified and crude toxins, respectively were achieved using an indirect ELISA method. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The Clostridium sp. RKD produced a potent neurotoxin earlier shown to have novelties. A specific detection assay for the neurotoxin has been developed that may be useful both from food safety and clinical point of view.
TI  - Pharmacological evidence for activation of phospholipid and small GTP binding protein signalling cascades by Nod factors.
AB  - The effects of lipo-chitin oligosaccharide Nod factors (NodNGR[S] from Rhizobium  sp. NGR234) on root hair deformation in Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. were studied using pharmacological agents to mimic and/or inhibit their action. It was hypothesised that the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton seen during Nod factor induced root hair deformation is modulated by protein kinase C, monomeric G proteins of the Rho superfamily and the location and amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (PI3Ps). This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. The protein kinase C activators, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate (DPA) and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1, stimulated root hair deformation to a level similar to that seen with Nod factors or mastoparan, whereas the inhibitor Go 6976 inhibited root hair deformations induced by NodNGR[S], mastoparan, DPA and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1. The Ras antagonists mevastatin and sulindac sulphide, and the Rho antagonist exoenzyme C3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum all inhibited Nod factor stimulated root hair deformation. Pasteurella multocida toxin activates Rho and stimulated root hair deformation, this stimulation was inhibited by both neomycin and exoenzyme C3 toxin. The PI3 kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY-294002 attenuated Nod factor induced root hair deformation. These studies were complemented with actin immunoprecipitations of root hair enriched microsomal membrane preparations from V. unguiculata which pulled down small GTP binding proteins. Root hair deformation is an important early stage in the formation of nitrogen fixing nodules and this study highlights that these processes may depend on signalling cascades involving phospholipids and small GTP binding proteins.
TI  - Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of neurotoxin gene from an environmental isolate of Clostridium sp.: comparison with other clostridial neurotoxins.
AB  - A Clostridium sp. isolated from intestine of decaying fish exhibited 99% sequence identity with C. tetani at 16S rRNA level. It produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized by botulinum antitoxin (A+B+E) as well as tetanus antitoxin. The gene fragments for light chain, C-terminal and N-terminal regions of the heavy chain of the toxin were amplified using three reported primer sets for tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). The neurotoxin gene fragments were cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. The sequences obtained exhibited approximately 98, 99 and 98% sequence identity with reported gene sequences of TeNT/LC, TeNT/HC and TeNT/HN, respectively. The phylogenetic interrelationship between the neurotoxin gene of Clostridium sp. with previously reported gene sequences of Clostridium botulinum A to G and C. tetani was examined by analysis of differences in the nucleotide sequences. Six amino acids were substituted at four different positions in the light chain of neurotoxin from the isolate when compared with the reported closest sequence of TeNT. Of these, four were located in the beta15 motif at a solvent inaccessible, buried region of the protein molecule. One of these substitutions were on the solvent accessible surface residue of alpha1 motif, previously shown to have strong sequence conservation. A substitution of two amino acids observed in N-terminal region of heavy chain were buried residues, located in the beta21 and beta37 motifs showing variability in other related sequences. The C-terminal region responsible for binding to receptor was conserved, showing no changes in the amino acid sequence.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium sp. RKD producing botulinum-like neurotoxin.
AB  - A Gram positive, motile, rod-shaped, strictly anaerobic bacterium isolated from intestine of decaying fish was identified as Clostridium sp. RKD and produced a botulinum type B-like neurotoxin as suggested by mouse bioassay and protection with anti botulinum antibodies. The neurotoxicity was functionally characterized by the phrenic nerve hemi-diaphragm assay. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence, placed it at a different position from the reported strains of Clostridium botulinum. The strain exhibited differences from both Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium tetani with respect to morphological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characteristics. Botulinum group specific and serotype specific primers amplified the DNA fragments of 260 and 727 bp, respectively, indicating presence of botulinum type 'B' toxin gene. Sequence of nearly 700 bp amplified using primers specific for botulinum neurotoxin type B gene, did not show any significant match in the database when subjected to BLAST search.
TI  - Prevotella massiliensis sp. nov. isolated from human blood.
AB  - We report a bacterial isolate (Marseille isolate) recovered from the blood of a patient hospitalized in an intensive care unit, presenting with severe trauma, fever and mechanical ventilation. Colonies appeared at 37 degrees C on blood agar after 72 h incubation. This isolate was a strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative rod phenotypically related to other Prevotella species described to date: non-motile, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, non-glucose fermenting, resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to kanamycin. Cells exhibited a trilamellar membrane under electron microscopy. The fatty acid methyl ester profile was marginally related to that of Clostridium botulinum group A (distance: 26.27%) and Bifidobacterium bifidum GC subgroup B (distance: 26.38%). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity was 90.0% with that of Prevotella oris and 89.1% with that of Prevotella melaninogenica. Partial rpoB gene sequence similarity was 84.5 and 86.4% with P. oris and P. melaninogenica, respectively. According to current standards, phenotypic traits, 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequence analyses indicated that the Marseille isolate belonged to a previously unrecognized species of the genus Prevotella, and we propose classifying it in the new taxon "Prevotella massiliensis" sp. nov.
TI  - RhoA/ROCK signaling is critical to FAK activation by cyclic stretch in cardiac myocytes.
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been shown to be activated in cardiac myocytes exposed to mechanical stress. However, details of how mechanical stimuli induce FAK activation are unknown. We investigated whether signaling events mediated by the RhoA/Rho-associated coiled coil-containing kinase (ROCK) pathway are involved in regulation of stretch-induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr(397) in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Immunostaining showed that RhoA localized to regions of myofilaments alternated with phalloidin (actin) staining. The results of coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that FAK and RhoA are associated in nonstretched NRVMs, but cyclic stretch significantly reduced the amount of RhoA recovered from anti-FAK immunoprecipitates. Cyclic stretch induced rapid and sustained (up to 2 h) increases in phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr(397) and ERK1/2 at Thr(202)/Tyr(204). Blockade of RhoA/ROCK signaling by pharmacological inhibitors of RhoA (Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme) or ROCK (Y-27632, 10 micromol/l, 1 h) markedly attenuated stretch-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Similar effects were observed in cells treated with the inhibitor of actin polymerization cytochalasin D. Transfection of NRVMs with RhoA antisense oligonucleotide attenuated stretch-induced FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of beta-myosin heavy chain mRNA. Similar results were seen in cells transfected with FAK antisense oligonucleotide. These findings demonstrate that RhoA/ROCK signaling plays a crucial role in stretch-induced FAK phosphorylation, presumably by coordinating upstream events operationally linked to the actin cytoskeleton.
TI  - Control of expression of the lectin-like protein Reg-1 by gastrin: role of the Rho family GTPase RhoA and a C-rich promoter element.
AB  - The expression of members of the Reg family of secreted lectin-like proteins is increased in response to stress, inflammation and damage in many tissues. In the stomach, Reg is located in enterochromaffin-like cells, where its expression is stimulated by the gastric hormone gastrin. We have examined the mechanisms by which gastrin stimulates expression of Reg-1. Deletional mutations of 2.1 to 0.1 kb of the rat Reg-1 promoter in a luciferase reporter vector were transiently transfected into gastric cancer AGS-G(R) cells. All promoter fragments tested showed similar relative increases in luciferase expression in response to gastrin (1 nM). The response to gastrin of the smallest (104 bp) construct was 4.2+/-0.4-fold over basal. These responses were reduced by Ro-32-0432, a protein kinase C inhibitor, by C3-transferase, a Clostridium botulinum toxin and a selective inhibitor of the Rho family GTPase RhoA, and by co-transfection with a dominant negative form of RhoA. Co-transfection with a constitutively active form of RhoA stimulated expression 11.6+/-1.7-fold over basal. Mutations through the 104 bp construct identified a C-rich element (C-79CCCTCCC-72) required for responses to gastrin, PKC (protein kinase C) and L63RhoA (the constitutively active form of human RhoA protein containing a glutamine-to-leucine substitution at position 63). EMSAs (electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays) using nuclear extracts of control and gastrin-stimulated AGS-G(R) cells and a probe spanning -86 to -64 bp revealed multiple binding proteins. There was no effect of gastrin on the pattern of binding. Supershift assays indicated that transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 bound the C-rich sequence. We conclude that gastrin stimulates Reg expression via activation of PKC and RhoA, that a C-rich region (-79 to -72) is critical for the response and that Sp-family transcription factors bind to this region of the promoter.
TI  - [Phenotype and genotype of Clostridium sp. strains producing botulism neurotoxin].
AB  - Neurotoxins produced by strains of Clostridium sp. are belonging to the most toxic biological substances. In the study phenotypes and genotypes of C. botulinum strains in animal studies in vivo and on the DNA level were evaluated, respectively. Additionally, the presence of genes encoding BoNT toxins of A, B, and E types among strains of Clostridium sp. were identified. In case of C. botulinum DNA was isolated from vegetative bacterial cells and from spores. Two different genes encoding two different neurotoxins harboured by three strains of Ae biotype/ae genotype, and by two strains of B biotype/be genotype were detected. Additionally, above E type C. botulinum strains, the presence of gene encoding E type neurotoxin, was found in genome of two C. baratii, two C. butyricum, and C. bifidobacterium, and C. oedematicum strains. C. bifidobacterium and C. oedematicum strains positive for presence of gene encoding E type neurotoxin, were found negative for E neurotoxin production in vivo in TN test. The study indicates that genes encoding BoNT/E neurotoxins are very common among Clostridium species. Phenotype and genotype analysis indicated co-presence of B phenotype together with be genotype and A phenotype together with ae genotype among C. botulinum strains.
TI  - Botulism: a laboratory investigation on biological and food samples from cases and outbreaks in Brazil (1982-2001).
AB  - Laboratory investigation of botulism from 1982 to 2001 confirmed the occurrence of eight positive outbreaks/cases of botulism in Brazil. From those, type A botulism was observed in seven of them. Biological material of one case (serum and feces) was positive in the first step of the bioassay, but the amount of sample was not sufficient for typification. One of the outbreaks that occurred in 2001 was negative for botulinum toxin in samples of serum, gastric washing and feces, collected eight days before the onset of the symptoms in the affected person who was clinically diagnosed as presenting the disease. Other two cases presenting compatible clinical diagnoses presented negative results. However, in those cases, the collection of samples was (1) after antiserum administration or (2) later than eight days of the onset of symptoms. Investigation was performed by mouse bioassay, as described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods (compiled by American Public Health Association--APHA)11, using specific antiserum from Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USA.
TI  - Evaluation of non-cyanobacterial genome sequences for occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to cyanophycin synthetase and cloning of an active cyanophycin synthetase from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587.
AB  - All publicly accessible microbial genome databases were searched for the occurrence of genes encoding proteins homologous to the cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 in order to reveal the capability of microorganisms not belonging to the cyanobacteria to synthesize cyanophycin. Among 65 genome sequences, genes homologous to cphA were found in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 (encoding a protein homologous to CphA with 40% amino acid identity), Bordetella bronchiseptica strain RB50 (39%), Bordetella pertussis strain Tohama I (39%), Bordetella parapertussis strain 12822 (39%), Clostridium botulinum strain ATCC 3502 (39%), Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain DCB-2 (38%) and Nitrosomonas europaea strain ATCC 25978 (37%). The gene homologous to cphA from Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 was amplified by PCR, ligated to the vector pBluescript SK(-) downstream of the lac promoter and introduced into Escherichia coli. The recombinant strain of E. coli expressed CphA activity at up to 1.2 U/mg protein and accumulated cyanophycin to up to 7.5% of the cellular dry matter, indicating that CphA of Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 is functionally active. In Acinetobacter sp. strain DSM 587 itself, cyanophycin accumulated to up to 1.4% of the total protein under phosphate-limited conditions, and cyanophycin synthetase activity was detected, which indicated the function of cyanophycin as a storage compound in this strain.
TI  - [Notification according to the law for protection against infections].
AB  - Since January 1st 2001, the Law for Protection Against Infections decrees the duty of notification along two tracks, on the one hand by notification of infectious diseases and on the other hand by reporting the pathogens. However, the names of pathogens change due to scientific progress. Furthermore, these names include in some cases not only harmful agents of infectious diseases but also inoffensive organisms, i. e. Giardia lamblia. There are also problems in the notification of other pathogens such as Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Chlamydia psittaci,Clostridium botulinum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Leptospira interrogans, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and similar agents, Norwalk-like viruses, Salmonella Paratyphi, Treponema pallidum, Trichinella spiralis and pathogenic serovars of Yersinia enterocolitica. Finally, the abandonment of notification for glanders, lymphogranuloma venereum, ulcus molle and variola appears to be risky, the reasons being partly unconvincing and contradictory.
TI  - Clostridium uliginosum sp. nov., a novel acid-tolerant, anaerobic bacterium with  connecting filaments.
AB  - An anaerobic, acid-tolerant bacterium, CK55T, was isolated from an acidic forest  bog. Cells of CK55T stained Gram-negative but did not have an outer membrane. Cells were spore-forming, motile rods with peritrichous flagella, formed chains or aggregates and were linked by connecting filaments that were composed of a core and outer sheath. Cellobiose, glucose, xylose, mannose, mannitol, sucrose and peptone supported growth. Arabinose, lactose, raffinose, H2/CO2, CO/CO2, vanillate, Casamino acids and various purines and pyrimidines did not support growth. Growth on carbohydrates yielded acetate, butyrate, lactate, formate and H2 as end-products. Growth was observed at pH 4.0-9.0, with an optimum at pH 6.5, and at 10-30 degrees C, with an optimum at 20-25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, doubling times were 4 and 6 h at pH 6.5 and 4.0, respectively. Hydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts was 12 U (mg protein)-1. CK55T did not: (i) contain detectable levels of CO, formate, lactate dehydrogenases or cytochromes; (ii) carry out dissimilatory reduction of nitrate or sulfate; or (iii) produce methane. Thus, CK55T was characterized as a non-acetogenic, fermentative chemo-organotroph. The G+C content of CK55T was 28.0 mol%. CK55T was phylogenetically most closely related to Clostridium botulinum (types B, E and F), Clostridium acetobutylicum and other saccharolytic clostridia; the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values to the nearest relatives of CK55T were approximately 97%. Based on morphological, physiological and phylogenetic properties of CK55T, it is proposed that CK55T be termed Clostridium uliginosum sp. nov. (= DSM 12992T = ATCC BAA-53T).
TI  - Differentiation of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum from non-toxigenic clostridia, isolated from prepared and frozen foods by PCR-DAN based methods.
AB  - During the elaboration process of prepared and frozen foods, Clostridium sp. have been reported. From those microorganisms, C. perfringens and C. botulinum may pose a high risk for the consumers. To avoid these pathogenic organisms an HACCP program should be implemented, but in addition sensitive and moderately time consuming microbiological methods for monitoring C. perfringens and C. boulinum should be established. In this work, an RFLP analysis of the 16S rDNA will be developed to differentiate C. perfringens from other Clostridium sp. In addition, a PCR protocol, will be assayed to detect C. botulinum. Both two methods will be compared with biochemical characterization by API system. The restriction analysis of the 16S rDNA with Taq I and Rsa I showed at least the same sensitivity to differentiate C. perfringens from clostridial isolates as biochemical identification. However, the former method takes only 8-10 h of analysis as compared with 24-48 h required for biochemical characterization. With the specific PCR protocol to detect C. botulinum a band of 1.1 kbp was obtained derived from the specific amplification of BoNT genes, taking 6-8 h for analysis. Both two molecular DNA based methods should be considered as verification techniques of pathogenic clostridia in the HACCP program.
TI  - Study of the presence of the spores of Clostridium botulinum in honey in Brazil.
AB  - The isolation of Clostridium botulinum from honey samples is described. Botulism  is characterized as an intoxication provoked by ingestion of contaminated foods with this toxin. Infant botulism happens by the ingestion of spores of C. botulinum together with food that in special conditions of the intestinal tract, such as those present in babies of less than 1 year old, will allow the germination and colonization of the intestine with production and absorption of botulinic toxin. The samples were subjected to dilution and to a thermal shock and cultivated in modified CMM (Difco). Cultures were subjected to Gram smears and toxicity tests in mice. The toxic cultures were purified in RFCA (Oxoid) plates and incubated in anaerobic jars. Positive samples were typed using the mouse assay neutralization test. From the 85 honey samples analyzed, six were positive for C. botulinum (7.06%), and identified as producers of type A, B, and D toxins.
TI  - Activation of G12/G13 results in shape change and Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated myosin  light chain phosphorylation in mouse platelets.
AB  - Platelets respond to various stimuli with rapid changes in shape followed by aggregation and secretion of their granule contents. Platelets lacking the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq do not aggregate and degranulate but still undergo shape change after activation through thromboxane-A2 (TXA2) or thrombin receptors. In contrast to thrombin, the TXA2 mimetic U46619 led to the selective activation of G12 and G13 in Galphaq-deficient platelets indicating that these G proteins mediate TXA2 receptor-induced shape change. TXA2 receptor-mediated activation of G12/G13 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72(syk) and stimulation of pp60(c-src) as well as in phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) in Galphaq-deficient platelets. Both MLC phosphorylation and shape change induced through G12/G13 in the absence of Galphaq were inhibited by the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum, by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and by cAMP-analogue Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS. These data indicate that G12/G13 couple receptors to tyrosine kinases as well as to the Rho/Rho-kinase-mediated regulation of MLC phosphorylation. We provide evidence that G12/G13-mediated Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent regulation of MLC phosphorylation participates in receptor-induced platelet shape change.
TI  - Molecular composition of the 16S toxin produced by a Clostridium botulinum type D strain, 1873.
AB  - The 16S toxin was purified from a Clostridium botulinum type D strain 1873 (D-1873). Furthermore, the entire nucleotide sequences of the genes coding for the 16S toxin were determined. It became clear that the purified D-1873 16S toxin consists of neurotoxin, nontoxic nonhemagglutinin (NTNH), and hemagglutinin (HA), and that HA consists of four subcomponents, HA1, HA2, HA3a, and HA3b, the same as type D strain CB16 (D-CB16) 16S toxin. The nucleotide sequences of the nontoxic components of these two strains were also found to be identical except for several bases. However, the culture supernatant and the purified 16S toxin of D-1873 showed little HA activity, unlike D-CB16, though the fractions successively eluted after the D-1873 16S toxin peak from an SP-Toyopearl 650S column showed a low level of HA activity. The main difference between D-1873 and D-CB16 HA molecules was the mobility of the HA1 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Therefore it was presumed that the loss of HA activity of D-1873 16S toxin might be caused by the differences of processing HA after the translation.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Production, purification, and characterization of botulinolysin, a thiol-activated hemolysin of Clostridium botulinum.
AB  - A hemolysin, botulinolysin, produced by Clostridium botulinum was purified to homogeneity and characterized. First, a strain of C. botulinum type C, strain C-203 Tox, which produced a large amount of hemolysin, was selected, and optimal culture medium and conditions for its production of hemolysin were determined. The hemolysin produced in the culture supernatant of this strain under optimal conditions was purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography, Sephadex G-75 gel permeation chromatography, and SP-Toyopearl 650 M cation-exchange column chromatography, with a recovery of 12%. The purified hemolysin gave a single protein band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with and without sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein in this band in PAGE with SDS was estimated to have a molecular weight of 58,000 and was immunostained with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In PAGE without SDS, the hemolytic activity corresponded in position to the single protein band. The pI of the hemolysin was 8.4. Amino acid analysis of the purified hemolysin indicated the presence of four half-cystine residues per molecule. The purified hemolysin had a specific activity of 2,100 hemolytic units per microgram of protein on rabbit erythrocytes. It was activated by SH compounds, inhibited by cholesterol, and heat labile. The optimum pH for hemolysis was 6.0 to 7.0. Rabbit, human, and guinea pig erythrocytes were the most susceptible to the hemolysin, while sheep, mouse, rat, and chicken erythrocytes were much less susceptible. The purified hemolysin had a lethal effect in mice and was cytotoxic for some cultured cells: its 50% lethal dose in mice was 310 ng, and its 50% cytotoxic dose for Vero cells was 120 ng/ml.
TI  - Purification of Clostridium botulinum type G progenitor toxin.
AB  - Clostridium botulinum type G cultured for 6 days at 30 degrees C in proteose peptone-yeast extract-glucose medium produced toxin of 1.3 x 10(4) LD50/ml. The toxin was precipitated at pH 4.0, extracted with 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and activated with trypsin. Sonic treatment and trypsinization of the residual precipitate released additional toxin, the toxicity of which corresponded to that detected in whole culture. Activated toxin obtained from the first extract and that from the residual precipitate were combined and purified by salting out, acid precipitation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, chromatography on SP-Sephadex, and a second gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The yield of purified toxin from 10 liters of culture was 22.9 mg an 1.1 X 10(8) mouse ip LD50 with a specific toxicity of 3.0 X 10(7) mouse ip LD50/mg nitrogen. The molecular weight of the toxin was about 500,000, corresponding to that of L toxin of the other types. No M nor LL toxin was detected.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of rock cod (Sebastes spp.) stored under elevated carbon dioxide atmospheres.
AB  - The numbers and types of microorganisms on fresh rock cod fillets and fillets stored in air or in a modified atmosphere (MA; 80% CO(2), 20% air) at 4 degrees C were compared. Samples were analyzed after 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of storage. The isolation plates were incubated aerobically, anaerobically, or under MA at 4, 20, or 35 degrees C. After 7 days of storage in air, the fillets were obviously spoiled and had a 3- to 4-log cycle increase in microbial counts. Plate counts increased more slowly on MA-stored fillets. After 21 days, the counts on the latter had increased only 2 log cycles, and the fillets did not seem spoiled. The microbial flora changed greatly during MA storage. Only Lactobacillus spp. (70%) and an Aeromonas sp.-like isolate (30%) were found on plates incubated aerobically at 4 and 20 degrees C, and only Lactobacillus spp. was found on plates incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 35 and at 20 degrees C under MA. Isolation plates incubated at 20 degrees C in air gave the highest counts in the shortest incubation time and the greatest diversity of bacterial types recovered. No Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, or Clostridium botulinum type E were isolated from the fresh or MA-stored fillets.
TI  - The effect of rifampicin on the developmental phases of germinating spores of Clostridum sp., MSp+.
AB  - The effect of rifampicin on the developmental phases of germinating spores of Clostridium botulinum, MSp+, has been studied. At sublethal concentrations of rifampicin (0.05 ng/ml) the time periods required for outgrowth and vegetative growth was significantly prolonged because of the inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. However, rifampicin had essentially no effect on DNA synthesis or on subsequent spore formation. Chemical analyses showed that the amount of protein present in vegetative cells of the rifampicin-treated cultures was twice as great as in the untreated cultures but the total protein content of endospores was the same in both cases. It was revealed in ultrastructural studies of rifampicin (0.1 ng/ml) treated cultures, examined after 22 h, that septum formation and normal cell division of the emerging cell was blocked and a few cells showed constriction which produced one normal and one protoplast-like daughter cell.
TI  - Growth and toxin production by Clostridium botulinum in moldy tomato juice.
AB  - Tomato juice inoculated with Cladosporium sp. or Penicillium sp. developed pH gradients with the upper portions near the mold mats having pH values near neutrality and the lower portions remaining more acid. Clostridium botulinum spores in these moldy tomato juices germinated, grew out, and produced toxin.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of an esterase-active enzyme from pronase with special reference to activation of Clostridium botulinum type E progenitor toxin.
AB  - (1) By sequential chromatography on CM-Sephadex, SP-Sephadex and Sephadex G-100,  an esterase-active enzyme was isolated from a commercial preparation of pronase, (2) The purity of the isolated enzyme was proven by disc electrophoresis and sedimentation analysis. (3) The molecular weight of the esterase-active enzyme was approximately 16,000. The sedimentation coefficient was 1.85 S. The N- and C-terminal amino acids were asparagine and valine, respectively. (4) The enzyme was similar to that of bovine trypsin in the substrate specificity. It appeared to be the same as the trypsin-like enzyme isolated from pronase by Wahyby (1968). However, the relative rates of hydrolyses of different substrates by the enzyme differed from those of bovine trypsin. (5) The enzyme activated Clostridium botulinum type E progenitor toxin. Even a higher toxicity was resulted by treating the progenitor toxin with this enzyme than with bovine trypsin. (6) The results support the hypothesis that activation of type E progenitor toxin involves hydrolysis of a lysine ester bond.
TI  - Sensitivity of an enrichment culture procedure for detection of Clostridium botulinum type E in raw and smoked whitefish chubs.
AB  - The sensitivity of an enrichment culture procedure for detecting Clostridium botulinum type E in whitefish chubs (Leucichthys sp.) was assayed. Data demonstrated that fish inoculated with 10 or more viable C. botulinum spores regularly develop specifically neutralizable enrichment cultures. Mild heat treatment (60 C, 15 min) substantially reduced the sensitivity of enrichment culturing. This effect was particularly noticeable in the culturing of fish which harbored fewer than 10 spores each. Evidence is presented which indicates that sensitivity of enrichment, without heat, approaches the level of one spore per fish. Smoked whitefish chubs, containing from one to several hundred spores each, were examined for toxin content after storage at 5, 10, 15, and 28 C for as long as 32 days. The lowest temperature at which detectable toxin was produced was 15 C. This occurred in 1 of 10 fish incubated for 14 days. C. botulinum was regularly recovered, by enrichment culture, from fish inoculated with small numbers of spores, even though toxin was not detected by direct extraction of incubated fish. Persistence of C. botulinum type E spores was observed to decline with an increase in the temperature and time at which inoculated fish were stored.
