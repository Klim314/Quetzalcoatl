TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new resin-based endodontic sealer against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of a new resin-based superbond (sb) sealer and five other sealers/cements against endodontic pathogens. the antimicrobial activities of sb sealer, sealapex, ah plus, roeko seal automix, canals n, and proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta)  were examined using a double-layered method. the microorganisms staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis were used. live microorganisms were stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the zones of inhibition of microorganism growth were measured. the antimicrobial activity of sb sealer was significantly lower than that of the other sealers, except for pro root mta, against s. aureus, c. albicans, s. mutans, and s. sanguinis, but no activity against e. faecalis was detected. on the other hand, ah plus exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. pro root mta showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested. sb sealer offered no antimicrobial advantage over the other sealers tested except for pro root mta.
