development of synbiotics with inulin, palatinose, alpha-cyclodextrin and probiotic bacteria.
success in creating a synbiotic depends on compatibility between the chosen components--prebiotic and probiotic. in this work the interactions between lactobacillus sp. strains isolated from yogurts and type strains of lactobacillus sp. and lactococcus sp., and the dependence of their growth and antibacterial activity on three oligosaccharides (os)--palatinose, inulin and alpha-cyclodextrin were investigated. all isolated lactobacilli produce antibacterial compounds, which possibly are the bacteriocins of lactobacillus casei atcc334 strain. results of growth analysis with different os revealed that part of lactobacilli isolated from yogurts can effectively ferment inulin and may be used for the development of synbiotics. palatinose and lactobacillus acidophilus could be used as symbiotics with effective antibacterial activity. one of the types of lactococcus sp. strains can assimilate palatinose and alpha-cyclodextrin, so they both can be used as components of synbiotics with the investigated lactococci. results of this analysis suggest that the investigated isolated and type strains of lactobacillus sp. and lactoccocus sp. can be useful as probiotics in the development of synbiotics. together with prebiotics--palatinose, inulin and alpha-cyclodextrin, the synbiotics, which could regulate not only the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, but also their antibacterial activity, can be created.
effect of aloe vera (aloe barbadensis miller) on survivability, extent of proteolysis and ace inhibition of potential probiotic cultures in fermented milk.
background: in the present investigation, the effect of aloe vera gel powder on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory activity, extent of proteolysis during fermentation and survival of lactobacillus casei ncdc19 during storage of fermented milk was studied. results: among the different cultures screened for ace inhibitory activity, lactobacillus casei ncdc 19 exhibited the highest ace inhibition (approx. 40%) as well as extent of proteolysis (0.37, abs(3)(4)(0)). in the presence of aloe vera (0.5% and 1% w/v) an increase in extent of proteolysis (0.460 +/- 0.047 and 0.480 +/- 0.027) and percent ace inhibitory activity (44.32 +/- 2.83 and 47.52 +/- 1.83) was observed in comparison to control. aloe vera powder addition also led to an increase in viable counts (>11 log cfu ml(-)(1)) of l. casei ncdc 19 in fermented milk during storage for 7 days and the counts were maintained in sufficiently higher numbers. conclusion: the study suggests aloe vera to be a good functional ingredient which can be further explored for different health attributes.
anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
inhibition of cronobacter sakazakii by heat labile bacteriocins produced by probiotic lab isolated from healthy infants.
cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia, meningitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, most often in neonates with case-fatality rates that may reach 80%. the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria against a wide range of foodborne pathogens is well-established in different types of food products. the objective of the current study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei isolated from feces of healthy infants against different strains of c. sakazakii in agar and a rehydrated infant milk formula (rimf) model. the inhibition zones of c. sakazakii around l. acidophilus or l. casei ranged from 22 to 32 mm on eman rogosa sharpe (mrs) agar under aerobic conditions, while a slight reduction in antibacterial activity was noted on modified mrs (0.2% glucose) under anaerobic conditions. it was observed that ph-neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs) of l. acidophilus or l. casei was inhibitory against tested c. sakazakii strains. the inhibition zones of neutralized cfs were lower than the antibacterial activities of live cultures. the antibacterial activity of cfs was abolished when cfs from l. acidophilus or l. casei was heated at 60 or 80 degrees c for either 10 min or 2 h, or treated with trypsin or pepsin. this was considered strong evidence that the inhibition was due to the production of bacteriocins by l. casei and l. acidophilus. both the cfs and active growing cells of l. casei and l. acidophilus were able to reduce the viability of c. sakazakii in the rimf model. the results may extend the use of natural antimicrobials instead of conventional preservation methods to improve the safety of rimf.
activities of free and encapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus la5 or lactobacillus casei 01 in processed longan juices on exposure to simulated gastrointestinal tract.
background: fruit drinks containing probiotics are gaining interest in the global marketplace. for example, longan juice, containing carbohydrate and various bioactive components, is a potentially health-promoting beverage as well as probiotic carrier for human consumption. in this study, high-pressure and thermal processes were applied to eliminate competitive micro-organisms in longan juice prior to the addition of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 or lactobacillus casei 01. the activities of these probiotics in a simulated gastrointestinal tract were also investigated. results: encapsulated probiotics could survive in the acidic environment of the stomach and small intestine, while the free cells were completely eliminated. in the colon experiment, the influence of encapsulated l. casei 01 on colon lactobacilli was significantly greater than that of encapsulated l. acidophilus la5. both encapsulated probiotics suspended in processed longan juices led to extensive increases in the formation of lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids (scfa). acetate was the major scfa produced by colon bacteria, followed by propionate and butyrate. the discernible clear zone suggested that l. casei 01 provided greater antibacterial activity than l. acidophilus la5. conclusion: both encapsulated probiotics along with processed longan juice led to significant increases in colon lactobacilli, lactic acid and scfa formation.
differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.
lactobacillus protected bone damage and maintained the antioxidant status of liver and kidney homogenates in female wistar rats.
the aim of the study was to evaluate protective property of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus in minimizing oxidative stress associated with arthritis from liver and kidney. subsequently, protective property of lactobacillus against the bone damage was also taken into consideration. arthritis was induced by injecting freund's complete adjuvant (100 mul) into sub plantar surface of hind paw. oral administration of culture, vehicle, and drug started after induction of arthritis (i.e. on day 9th). indomethacin was used as a standard drug. radiographic analysis of the hind paw knee joint was also done at the end of the 21st day. oxidative stress parameters were studied from liver and kidney homogenate. histopathology of liver and kidney was also performed. lactobacillus treatment significantly rescued the enzymatic level of catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase in both liver and kidney homogenates, whereas it has decreased the malonaldehyde accumulation. oral administration of lactobacillus also significantly decreased the serum ceruloplasmin level. radiographic analysis also corroborated these findings. lactobacillus treatment maintained the normal histopathology of liver and kidney. results of this study clearly suggest that l. casei and l. acidophilus, alone or in combination, decreased the bone damaged and effectively restored antioxidant status of liver and kidney. lactobacillus has a significant antiarthritic and antioxidant activity against freund's complete adjuvant induced arthritis in rats.
the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii, and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
anti-inflammatory activity of lactobacillus on carrageenan-induced paw edema in male wistar rats.
introduction. lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were used to assess the anti-inflammatory properties in carrageenan induced acute inflammatory model. materials and methods. diclofenac sodium was used as standard drug at concentration of 150 mg/kg of body weight. culture of lactobacillus 2 x 10(7) cfu/ml was given orally. edema was induced with 1% carrageenan to all the groups after one hour of the oral treatments. paw thickness was checked at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 24 hours. stair climbing score and motility score were assessed at t = 24 hours. cytokines assay for il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha was performed on serum samples. results. lactobacillus showed a statistically significant decrease in paw thickness at p < 0.001. l. acidophilus and l. casei decreased by 32% and 28% in paw thickness. they both significantly increased the stair climbing and motility score. lactobacillus treatment significantly downregulated il-6 and tnf-alpha while upregulated il-10 at p < 0.0001. conclusion. l. casei and l. acidophilus significantly decreased the inflammatory reactions induced by carrageenan. this study has also proposed that lactobacillus ameliorated the inflammatory reaction by downregulating the proinflammatory cytokines pathway.
antimicrobial activity of an amazon medicinal plant (chancapiedra) (phyllanthus niruri l.) against helicobacter pylori and lactic acid bacteria.
the potential of water extracts of the amazon medicinal plant chancapiedra (phyllanthus niruri l.) from ecuador and peru for antimicrobial activity against helicobacter pylori and different strains of lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum was investigated. h. pylori was inhibited by both water extracts in a dose dependent manner, whereas lactic acid bacterial growth was not affected. both extracts contained ellagic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and exhibited high free radical scavenging linked-antioxidant activities (89%). however, gallic acid was detected only in the ecuadorian extract. preliminary studies on the mode of action of chancapiedra against h. pylori revealed that inhibition may not involve proline dehydrogenase-based oxidative phosphorylation inhibition associated with simple mono-phenolics and could involve ellagitannins or other non-phenolic compounds through a yet unknown mechanism. this study provides evidence about the potential of chancapiedra for h. pylori inhibition without affecting beneficial lactic acid bacteria.
physico-chemical properties, probiotic survivability, microstructure, and acceptability of a yogurt-like symbiotic oats-based product using pre-polymerized whey protein as a gelation agent.
consumption of a food product containing prebiotics and probiotics has been recognized as an important factor in lowering risk of intestinal cancer and gastrointestinal diseases and risks associated with high cholesterol. an oats-based symbiotic yogurt-like food (oagurt) was developed using oats and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium), with pre-polymerized whey protein (pwp) as a gelation agent. the product was also fortified with inulin to increase soluble fiber, minerals, and vitamins. physico-chemical analyses and 9 wk shelf life for viability of probiotics and changes in ph and viscosity were carried out for formulations with (f) and without (c) fortification. results of the shelf life study showed that both l. casei and bifidobacterium remained at therapeutic levels: 4.8 x 10(6) cfu/g (f), 4.3 x 10(6) cfu/g (c) and 3.1 x 10(6) cfu/g (f), 3.17 x 10(6) cfu/g (c) after 9 wk. however l. acidophilus did not survive after 3 wk. viscosity and ph decreased significantly during the study with the difference between formulations also significant for ph (p < 0.0001). scanning electron microscopy of samples revealed that the pre-polymerized whey protein played a major role in the structure of the gel with an increased protein network structure visible at higher pwp levels. a consumer acceptability study showed that the product was "fair" for all organoleptic attributes.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa).
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant microorganism and the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria against mrsa from ten human clinical isolates as well as mrsa standard strain atcc 43300 was tested in vitro. the lactobacillus (lb.) strains (lb. acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lb. casei lbc80r) as pure cultures, which came from commercial food products were employed. the growth inhibitory effect produced by the antimicrobial activity of the lactic acid bacteria on the mrsa strains was tested on solid medium using agar diffusion methods as well as a using a liquid medium procedure that contained a mixture of mrsa and lactic acid bacteria cultures. in the latter instance, we were able to demonstrate that the direct interaction of lactic acid bacteria and mrsa in such a mixture led to the elimination of 99% of the mrsa cells after 24 h of their incubation at 37 degrees c.
screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.
probiotic crescenza cheese containing lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
high-pressure homogenization (hph) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. to evaluate the potential of milk treated by hph for the production of crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: hph (from hph-treated milk), p (from pasteurized milk), hph-p (hph-treated milk plus probiotics), and p-p (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. a strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees c). according to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and ph. differently, the hph treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. in fact, after 12 d of storage, the lactobacillus paracasei a13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus h5 exhibited, in p-p cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the hph-p cheese. the hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. no significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among hph and p cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among hph, hph-p, and p-p crescenza cheeses.
a comparative study of the preventative effects exerted by three probiotics, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus, in the tnbs model of rat colitis.
aims: the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of three probiotics with immunomodulatory properties, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium lactis, were evaluated and compared in the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (tnbs) model of rat colitis. methods and results: colitis was induced in rats by intracolonic administration of 10 mg of tnbs dissolved in 0.25 ml of 50% ethanol. each probiotic was administered orally (5x10(8) cfu suspended in 0.5 ml of skimmed milk) for 3 weeks, starting 2 weeks before the administration of tnbs. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically 1 week after tnbs instillation. the results obtained revealed that all probiotics assayed showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects, macroscopically evidenced by a significant reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. only b. lactis showed a lower incidence of diarrhoea in comparison with untreated rats. biochemically, all probiotics restored colonic glutathione levels, depleted as a consequence of the oxidative stress of the inflammatory process. bifidobacterium lactis treatment reduced colonic tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha production, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2) expression; l. acidophilus administration reduced colonic leukotriene b4 production and inos expression and l. casei intake was associated with a decrease in colonic cox-2 expression. conclusion: the three probiotics assayed have shown intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in the tnbs model of rat colitis, although each probiotic shows its own anti-inflammatory profile. significance and impact of the study: these probiotics could be considered as potential adjuvants in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, although more studies are required in order to demonstrate their efficacy in humans.
formation of oligosaccharides in skim milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures, lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis and probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures ncdc167, lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis ncdc60 and two probiotic strains; lactobacillus acidophilus ncdc14 and lb. casei ncdc19 were evaluated after fermentation (14 h) and during 8 d storage at 7 degrees c. the beta-galactosidase activity was found to increase after fermentation leading to the hydrolysis of lactose and production of glucose, galactose and oligosaccharides; that subsequently decreased during storage. the viable counts of lactococci and lactobacilli decreased during storage yet remained >106 cfu/ml after storage. the results of present study indicate that all the selected cultures have ability to produce oligosaccharides (prebiotics) due to transgalactosidal and lactose hydrolysis activities of beta-galactosidase. the cultures developed an active synbiotic formula by maintaining sufficient probiotic viable counts to exert health benefits to the consumers.
[the electron microscopic study of cell-to-cell interactions between antagonistic microorganisms].
the electron microscopic study of thin sections and positively stained specimens  of cells taken from particular cocultures of lactobacillus acidophilus d75, lactobacillus casei yit 9018, shigella flexnery 2a, bacillus subtilis atcc 6633, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 (some of these bacteria are antagonistic to others) showed the presence of specific ultrastructural elements indicating cell specialization and cooperation. the responses of antagonistic bacteria manifested themselves at the cellular and population levels.
effects of lactobacillus strains on cancer cell proliferation and oxidative stress in vitro.
aims: the objective of this study was to assess in vitro, whether heat-killed (hk) lactic acid bacteria cells and fractionations of hk cells could suppress the viability of human cancer cells and inhibit the cytotoxicity associated with oxidative stress. methods and results: among the strains, the hk cells of lactobacillus acidophilus 606 and lactobacillus casei atcc 393 exhibited the most profound inhibitory activity in all of the tested cell lines. hk cells of l. acidophilus 606 were determined to be less toxic to healthy human embryo fibroblasts (hef cells) than were hk cells of l. casei atcc 393. the soluble polysaccharides from l. acidophilus 606 evidenced the most effective anticancer activity, but inhibited hef cell growth by only 20%. the soluble polysaccharides from l. acidophilus 606 were partly observed to induce apoptosis in the ht-29 cells by dna fragmentation and propidium iodine staining. both the hk cells of l. acidophilus 606 and the soluble polysaccharide components of this strain also exhibited potent antioxidative activity. conclusions: our findings suggest that the soluble polysaccharide fraction from l. acidophilus 606 may constitute a novel anticancer agent, which manifests a high degree of selectivity for human cancer cells and antioxidative agent in the food industry. significance and impact of the study: these soluble polysaccharide components from lactobacillus may be applied to various foods, and used as adjuncts for cancer therapy and prevention.
viability of commercial probiotic cultures (l. acidophilus, bifidobacterium sp.,  l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) in cheddar cheese.
six batches of cheddar cheese were manufactured containing different combinations of commercially available probiotic cultures from three suppliers. duplicate cheeses contained the organisms of each supplier, a bifidobacterium spp. (each supplier), a lactobacillus acidophilus (2 suppliers), and either lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, or lactobacillus rhamnosus. using selective media, the different strains were assessed for viability during cheddar cheese maturation over 32 weeks. the bifidobacterium sp. remained at high numbers with the three strains being present in cheese at 4 x 10(7), 1.4 x 10(8), and 5 x 10(8) cfu/g after 32 weeks. similarly the l. casei (2 x 10(7) cfu/g), l. paracasei (1.6 x 10(7) cfu/g), and l. rhamnosus (9 x 10(8) cfu/g) strains survived well; however, the l. acidophilus strains performed poorly with both decreasing in a similar manner to be present at 3.6 x 10(3) cfu/g and 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/g after 32 weeks. this study indicates that cheddar cheese is a good vehicle for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of l. acidophilus strains will need to be improved.
kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.
antimicrobial potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
antibacterial activity is an important characteristic of probiotics. a possible way to achieve this antibacterial activity is through the production of bacteriocins. this study shows that the commercial probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1 and lactobacillus casei yit 9029 produce bacteriocins. the nature of the antimicrobial compound could be derived from its behaviour: a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only active against closely related strains), loss of activity when treated with proteinases, and rather small molecular masses (around 6000 da or less). further, three bacteriocins produced by lb. johnsonii la1, lb. casei yit 9029 and lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 showed inhibitory activity against the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. however, a fourth bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 was not able to inhibit h. pylori. this indicates that some bacteriocins produced by specific probiotic strains can fulfil a role in the inhibition of this common pathogen.
[in vitro effect of carbohydrates and enteric bacteria on adherence of candida albicans].
the adherence of candida albicans to any cell is considered essential in the process that leads to colonization. our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of different carbohydrates and the presence of lactobacilli and escherichia coli on the in vitro adherence of candida albicans. the adherence to buccal epithelial cells was higher when growing at concentrations of galactose of 50, and 200 mm, as well as 50, 200, and 500 mm of sucrose, and 500 mm of mannose, compared with that obtained when growing in sabouraud dextrose broth (p < 0.01). the presence of other microorganisms, such as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. casei, caused a decrease in the in vitro adherence of c. albicans to buccal epithelial cells (p < 0.05), whereas e. coli did not modify this adherence at all.
effect of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and inulin on the formation of aberrant crypt foci in rats.
background: our studies were aimed at investigating the effect of lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) or inulin, a natural source of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from chicory, on the induction by carcinogens of aberrant crypt foci (acf) in the colon, which are considered to be early precursor lesions of neoplasia. methods: strains of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were administered to rats fed a purified high starch diet, under a variety of treatment protocols including daily gavage, via the drinking water and in the diet. the rats were treated with methyl-n-nitrosourea, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, or azoxymethane (aom) to induce acf. results: in general, no consistent significant changes in acf numbers were detected in these experiments. in one study, the basal diet of the rats was changed to one containing a higher level of fat (corn oil). under these conditions, a significant decrease in aom-induced colonic acf was seen in rats given l. acidophilus or inulin. in a concurrent group of animals fed a low fat diet, no significant decrease in acf was observed. conclusions: the results indicate that the type of diet fed can influence the detection of protective effects of lab and oligosaccharides and that against the background of a diet with a level of fat typical of a western diet, evidence for a protective effect of l. acidophilus and inulin towards colon cancer was obtained
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
probiotic effects of feeding heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei to candida albicans-colonized immunodeficient mice.
probiotic bacteria can protect immunodeficient mice from orogastric candidiasis but cause some pathology of their own. severely immunodeficient patients may be at risk if fed viable probiotics, so this study evaluated the probiotic potential of nonviable probiotic bacteria to protect immunodeficient mice from candida albicans infections. heat-killed probiotic bacteria were fed to gnotobiotic bg/bg-nu/nu and bg/bg-nu/+ mice to ascertain if they could protect the mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. both heat-killed lactobacillus acidophilus (hkla) and heat-killed lactobacillus casei (hklc), in comparison to control mice not fed the probiotic bacteria but challenged (oral) with c. albicans, suppressed the severity of orogastric candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice at 2 weeks after colonization with c. albicans, inhibited disseminated candidiasis in c. albicans-colonized bg/bg-nu/+ mice at 4 weeks after colonization, and suppressed the number of viable c. albicans in the alimentary tract. hkla, but not hklc, treatment inhibited disseminated candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice at 2 weeks after oral challenge and enhanced the proliferative responses of splenocytes from c. albicans-colonized bg/bg-nu/+ mice to c. albicans antigens. neither hkla nor hklc were able to prolong the survival of gnotobiotic bg/bg-nu/nu mice after oral challenge with c. albicans. these results demonstrate that heat-killed lactobacilli can induce some (limited) protection (probiotic effect) against candidiasis in mice.
growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.
the effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
four common lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. mice received perorally 10(9) viable bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and b-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (lps) (by 27-28%). conversely, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation, particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin a (by 43-68%) and lps (by 23-62%). therefore, these lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on b- and t-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
lactic acid-mediated suppression of helicobacter pylori by the oral administration of lactobacillus salivarius as a probiotic in a gnotobiotic murine model.
objectives: we examined whether or not the lactobacilli administered to treat helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection can suppress the colonization of h. pylori, and we also sought to elucidate the mechanism of such suppression. methods: we used an in vitro culture system and an h. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. results: among the lactobacillus species examined in vitro, lactobacillus salivarius (l. salivarius) but not l. casei or l. acidophilus proved to be capable of producing a high amount of lactic acid and thus completely inhibiting the growth of h. pylori in a mixed culture. the validity of l. salivarius as a probiotic to suppress h. pylori and thus reduce the inflammatory response was again confirmed in vivo by using an h. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. conclusion: based on our findings, l. salivarius was found to be a potentially effective probiotic against h. pylori.
inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from lactobacillus isolates.
in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000 to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l. acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.
antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.
growth of lactobacilli, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli in normal and  mastitic milk and whey.
the growth of three lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and l. casei), staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was followed in normal and mastitic milk and whey using the standard plate count method. l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus 6032 and l. casei 6028 grew well in normal milk, but had decreased growth in mastitic milk if not pre-adapted in mastitic whey. s. aureus 26003 and e. coli 44102 showed enhanced growth in mastitic milk as compared with their growth in normal milk. these mastitis pathogens grew faster than the lactobacilli in both the normal milk and the mastitic milk. among the lactobacilli, l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus grew faster than l. casei in both types of milk samples. all the bacteria tested grew well in the normal and mastitic whey samples. however, they seemed to have enhanced growth in mastitic whey with the exception of l. casei. pre-adaptation of the bacteria in mastitic whey in subculture markedly improved the growth of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in mastitic milk. all the bacteria showed decreased replication in mastitic milk as compared with mastitic whey.
antimutagenicity of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria against n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine.
the antimutagenic effect of cultured milk using 71 strains of lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, and bifidobacterium on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine was investigated in vitro using salmonella typhimurium ta 100 as an indicator bacterium. each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect on the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine. the milk cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus la 106 (la2) showed the highest inhibition of 77% against the mutagenicity of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine among the strains tested. changes in the antimutagenic effect of the milk cultured by lb. acidophilus la 106 (la2) during incubation were also examined using n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine as a mutagen.
[bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.
[sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
[sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.
