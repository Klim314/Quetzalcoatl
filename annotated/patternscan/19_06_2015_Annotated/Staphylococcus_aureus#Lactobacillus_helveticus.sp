TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == [development of polycomponent metabolite probiotic].
AB  == aim: construct composition of polycomponent probiotic based on lactobacilli cultural fluid (cf) supernatant. materials and methods: species membership of lactobacilli strains was specified by analysis of nucleotide sequences of 16s rna genes. for comparison of probiotic effect of cf, supernatant and ultrafiltrate of a consortium of lactobacilli strains, studies of specter of peptides, amino- and  other organic acids contained in them as well as profile of bactericidal and fungicidal activity was carried out. results; technology of production of amicrobial probiotic agent based on cf of the consortium of lactobacilli strains  was developed. during determination of concentration of metabolites of protein nature analogy of parameters was shown in cf supernatant and native lactobacilli  cultures. in both the studied supernatants and cf the same set of organic acids was also reported to be present. during comparison of antimicrobial and anticandidosis activity of lactobacilli native culture and cf supernatant against staphylococcus aureus 209, enterococcus faecalis 1154 and candida albicans 5 test-strains, an equivalent effect of both samples was shown. conclusion: polycomponent metabolite probiotic based on cf supernatant of lactobacillus helveticus nkjc, lactobacillus helveticus jch and lactobacillus casei kaa strains completely retains bactericidal and fungicidal activity of the native culture of  the consortium of strains and at the same time lacks disadvantages of compositions containing live microorganisms.

TI  == antioxidative potential of folate producing probiotic lactobacillus helveticus cd6.
AB  == folate producing lactobacillus sp. cd6 isolated from fermented milk showed 98% similarity with lactobacillus helveticus based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. it was found to produce a folic acid derivative 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-methf). the intracellular cell-free extract of strain demonstrated antioxidative activity with the inhibition rate of ascorbate autoxidation in the range of 27.5% +/- 3.7%. it showed highest metal ion chelation ability for fe(2+) (0.26 +/- 0.06 ppm) as compared to cu(2+). the dpph  (alpha,alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity for intact cells were found to be 24.7% +/- 10.9% proved its antioxidative potential. furthermore, it demonstrated 14.89% inhibition of epinephrine autoxidation, 20.9  +/- 1.8 mug cysteine equivalent reducing activity and 20.8% +/- 0.9% hydroxyl radical scavenging effect. the strain was evaluated for probiotic properties as per who and fao guidelines. it showed 90.61% survival at highly acidic condition  (ph 2.0), 90.66% viability in presence of synthetic gastric juice and 68% survivability at 0.5% bile concentration for 24 h. it was susceptible to many antibiotics which reduces the prospect to offer resistance determinants to other  organisms if administered in the form of probiotic preparations. it showed in vitro mucus binding and antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens like salmonella typhimurium (ncim 2501), streptococcus pyogenes (ncim 2608), and staphylococcus aureus (ncim 5021) and moreover it showed non- hemolytic activity  on sheep blood agar.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

TI  == potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from specific natural niches in food production and preservation.
AB  == autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been isolated from traditionally homemade cheeses collected from specific ecological localities across serbia and montenegro. genetic and biochemical analysis of this lab revealed that they produce bacteriocins, proteinases and exopolysaccharides. lab  produces a variety of antimicrobial substances with potential importance for food fermentation and preservation. apart from the metabolic end products, some strains also secrete antimicrobial substances known as bacteriocins. among the natural isolates of lab from homemade cheeses, bacteriocin producers were found in both lactococci and lactobacilli. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgmn1-5 was found to produce three narrow spectrum class ii heat-stable bacteriocins. in addition to bacteriocin production, bgmn1-5 synthesized a cell envelope-associated proteinase (cep) and shows an aggregation phenotype. another  isolate, l. lactis subsp. lactis bgsm1-19 produces low molecular mass (7 kda) bacteriocin sm19 that showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus flavus and partially against salmonella paratyphi. production of bacteriocin reaches a plateau after 8 h of bgsm1-19 growth. bacteriocin sm19 retained activity within the wide ph range from 1 to 12 and after the treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. among collection of lactobacilli, the isolate lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgsj2-8 produces heat-stable bacteriocin sj (approx. 5 kda) polypeptide. it retained activity after treatment for 1 h at 100 degrees c, and in the ph range from 2 to 11. in addition to isolates from cheeses, bacteriocin-producing human oral lactobacilli were detected. most of them showed antimicrobial activity against streptococci, staphylococci and micrococci, but not against candida. isolate bgho1 that showed the highest antimicrobial activity was determined as l. paracasei. interestingly, lactobacillus helveticus bgra43, which was isolated from the human intestine showed strong activity against clostridium sporogenes, but it was not possible to detect any bacteriocin production in this isolate by using standard procedures. further analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that bgra43 has a relatively  broad spectrum. lactobacilli resistant to nisin were also detected among natural  isolates. they produce bacteriocins, which have no activity against nisin producing lactococci.

TI  == effect of chosen lactic acid bacteria strains on staphylococcus aureus in vitro as well as in meat and raw sausages.
AB  == the present study was aimed at determining the influence of 15 strains of lactic  acid bacteria on the growth of 2 staphylococcus aureus strains in vitro as well as in meat and raw sausages. the investigations were performed within the framework of three alternate stages which differed in respect to the products studied, the number of lactobacillus sp. strains and, partly, methodological approach. the study also considered water activity (a(w)) and ph of the products  investigated. the results obtained are demonstrated in 5 diagrams. it was found that among 15 strains of lactobacillus aureus investigated only one strain, lactobacillus helveticus t 78, showed antagonistic effect on studied strains of staphylococcus aureus both in vitro as well as in meat and raw sausages. five other strains of lactobacillus spp. displayed the antagonistic effect in vitro only. the temperature and incubation time of sausages, but also the type of sausage stuffing were found to have a distinct or slight influence, respectively, on the antagonistic interaction between the bacteria. however, this phenomenon was affected by neither a(w) nor ph.

TI  == interactions between high pressure homogenization and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase.
AB  == it was the objective of this work to evaluate the effect of high pressure homogenization on the activity of antimicrobial enzymes such as lysozyme and lactoperoxidase against a selected group of gram positive and gram negative species inoculated in skim milk. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and listeria monocytogenes were the most pressure resistant species while bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas putida, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enteritidis were found to  be very sensitive to the hyperbaric treatment. the enzyme addition enhanced the instantaneous pressure efficacy on almost all the considered species as indicated by their instantaneous viability loss following the treatment. moreover, the combination of the enzyme and high pressure homogenization significantly affected the recovery and growth dynamics of several of the considered species. although l. monocytogenes was slightly sensitive to pressure, the combination of the two stress factors induced a significant viability loss within 3 h and an extension of lag phases in skim milk during incubation at 37 degrees c. the hypothesis formulated in this work is that the interaction of high pressure homogenization and lysozyme or lactoperoxidase is associated to conformational modifications of  the two proteins with a consequent enhancement of their activity. this hypothesis is supported by the experimental results also regarding the increased antimicrobial activity against l. plantarum of the previously pressurised lysozyme with respect to that of the native enzyme.

TI  == angiotensin i-converting-enzyme-inhibitory and antibacterial peptides from lactobacillus helveticus pr4 proteinase-hydrolyzed caseins of milk from six species.
AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == high pressure inactivation of microorganisms inoculated into ovine milk of different fat contents.
AB  == high hydrostatic pressure inactivation of escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus helveticus were studied. these microorganisms were inoculated at a concentration  between 10(7) and 10(8) cfu/ml in ringer solution and in ovine milk adjusted to 0, 6, and 50% fat content to evaluate the baroprotective effect of fat content on inactivation of microorganisms. treatments of pressurization consisted of combinations of pressure (100 to 500 mpa) and temperature (4, 25, and 50 degrees  c) for 15 min. gram-negative microorganisms were more sensitive than were gram-positive ones (more destruction p. fluorescens > e. coli > or = list. innocua > lb. helveticus > s. aureus). pressurizations at low temperature (4 degrees c) produced greater inactivation on p. fluorescens, list. innocua, and lb. helveticus than at room temperature (25 degrees c), whereas for e. coli and s. aureus the results were opposite. ovine milk per se (0% fat) showed a baroprotective effect on all microorganisms, but percentage of fat (6 and 50%) did not show a progressive baroprotective effect in all pressurization conditions or for all microorganisms.

TI  == sensitivity of staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus helveticus in ovine milk subjected to high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == ovine milk, standardized to 6% fat, was inoculated with staphylococcus aureus cect 534 and lactobacillus helveticus cect 414 at a concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml and treated by high hydrostatic pressure. treatments consisted of combinations of pressure (200, 300, 400, 450, and 500 mpa), temperature (2, 10, 25, and 50 degrees c), and time (5, 10, and 15 min). staphylococcus aureus was highly resistant to pressure; only pressurizations at 50 degrees c of 500 mpa for 15 min achieved reductions of > or = 7.3 log units. for l. helveticus, the number of surviving cells was reduced considerably at pressures of 400 mpa or more (up to 4.5 log units at 50 degrees c for 15 min), and pressure was more effective at low (2 and 10 degrees c) and moderately high (50 degrees c) temperatures than at room temperature (25 degrees c). both species showed first-order kinetics of destruction in the range 0 to 60 min. the d values for s. aureus were 20 min (2 degrees c at 450 mpa) and 16.7 min (25 degrees c at 450 mpa), and d values for l. helveticus were 7.1 min (2 degrees c at 450 mpa) and 9.1 min (25 degrees c at 450 mpa). lactobacillus helveticus showed higher rates of survival of pressure than those reported in previous studies for other lactobacillus spp.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pac1 from acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  == a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pack5 and pact72 with replicon of pac1 plasmid from acetobacter pasteurianus. as was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in escherichia coli, acetobacter pasteurianus, acetobacter aceti,  shigella spp. and citrobacter spp. expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, comamonas terrigena, salmonella typhimurium, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, bacillus megatericum, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus helveticus, micrococcus luteus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of  plasmid dna was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.

TI  == characterization of is1201, an insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == is1201, a 1387-bp insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus helveticus, was  identified by its nucleotide (nt) sequence. it carries a single open reading frame encoding a 369-amino-acid protein, which shares homology with transposases  found in a class of related is, including isrm3 from rhizobium meliloti, is256 from staphylococcus aureus, is6120 from mycobacterium smegmatis, is1081 from m. bovis, ist2 from thiobacillus ferroxidans and is406 from pseudomonas cepacia. is1201 has terminal inverted repeats of 24 bp in length and a target site duplication of 8 bp. its copy number ranges from 3 to about 16 per l. helveticus  genome. no homology was found between the nt sequence of is1201 and those of the  other bacterial is from the same class. these results, together with previous observations [de los reyes-gavilan et al., appl. environ. microbiol., 58 (1992) 3429-3432], confirm that is1201 can be used as a specific dna probe for the identification of l. helveticus strains.

TI  == a general method for cloning reca genes of gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == an internal fragment of the reca gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. the internal 348- or 360-bp reca dna segments from bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, leuconostoc mesanteroides, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the g + c contents of the dna from these species range from 28 to 52%. the sequences of the bacterial reca genes show strong relatedness. this method is particularly useful  for the recovery of the reca genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
