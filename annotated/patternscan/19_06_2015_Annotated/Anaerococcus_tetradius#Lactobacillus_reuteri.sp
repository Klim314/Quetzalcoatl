TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus reuteri-containing tablets on the subgingival and salivary microbiota in patients with gingivitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of an orally administered probiotic on the  oral microbiota. methods: a placebo-controlled, parallel study was conducted in 40 gingivitis subjects during 8 weeks. treatment consisted on the administration  of a daily tablet, either containing lactobacillus reuteri or placebo. unstimulated saliva and subgingival samples were collected and analysed by culture and pcr. clinical and microbiological outcome variables were compared between and within groups. results: there were no significant changes between and within the groups in the clinical variables. in saliva, total anaerobic counts after 4 weeks (p = 0.021) and counts of prevotella intermedia after 8 weeks (p =  0.030), showed reductions in the test group. in subgingival samples, significant  reductions in the changes baseline to 4 weeks were observed for p. gingivalis counts (p = 0.008). with pcr, l. reuteri atcc-pta-5289 was more frequently detected than l. reuteri dsm-17938. conclusions: the effect of l. reuteri administered in tablets resulted in a reduction in the number of selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival microbiota, without an associated clinical impact.

TI  == crystal structure of a mucus-binding protein repeat reveals an unexpected functional immunoglobulin binding activity.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri mucus-binding protein (mub) is a cell-surface protein that  is involved in bacterial interaction with mucus and colonization of the digestive tract. the 353-kda mature protein is representative of a broadly important class  of adhesins that have remained relatively poorly characterized due to their large size and highly modular nature. mub contains two different types of repeats (mub1 and mub2) present in six and eight copies, respectively, and shown to be responsible for the adherence to intestinal mucus. here we report the 1.8-a resolution crystal structure of a type 2 mub repeat (184 amino acids) comprising  two structurally related domains resembling the functional repeat found in a family of immunoglobulin (ig)-binding proteins. the n-terminal domain bears striking structural similarity to the repeat unit of protein l (ppl) from peptostreptococcus magnus, suggesting binding in a non-immune fab-dependent manner. a distorted ppl-like fold is also seen in the c-terminal domain. as with  ppl, mub repeats were able to interact in vitro with a large repertoire of mammalian igs, including secretory iga. this hitherto undetected activity is consistent with the current model that antibody responses against commensal flora are of broad specificity and low affinity.
