TI  - Platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  - Platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. Platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, FcgammaRII, Toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as GPIIb-IIIa or GPIb. Bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement C1q, the von Willebrand Factor, etc. The fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. Several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. Are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? Indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on S. aureus. Besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for Streptococcus sanguinis, S. epidermidis, or C. pneumoniae. On the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. We, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. Moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. Indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. In conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an anti-pseudomonal dichlorocarbazol derivative displaying anti-biofilm activity.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant towards all currently available antibiotics are increasingly encountered, raising the need for new anti-pseudomonal drugs. We therefore conducted a medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule collection resulting in the identification of the N-alkylated 3,6-dihalogenocarbazol 1-(sec-butylamino)-3-(3,6-dichloro-9H-carbazol-9-yl)propan-2-ol (MIC = 18.5 mug mL(-)(1)). This compound, compound 1, is bacteriostatic towards a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa. Importantly, 1 also eradicates mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa. 1 displays no cytotoxicity against various human cell types, pointing to its potential for further development as a novel antibacterial drug.
TI  - Oral bacterial DNA findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial DNA can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. Some case reports describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with PCR; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial PCR has not been used as a diagnostic method before. OBJECTIVE: To find out whether bacterial DNA can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at Tampere University Hospital during 2009-2010. Of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (CAD), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe CAD. Bacterial DNA amounts were determined using real-time quantitative PCR with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (Streptococcus mitis group, Streptococcus anginosus group, Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatus, and Dialister pneumosintes). RESULTS: Of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. Only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. There was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial DNA in the pericardial fluid and the severity of CAD (p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Oral bacterial DNA was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of CAD and the total amount of bacterial DNA in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on Titanium Grade 2 and Ti6Al4V alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  The aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure Grade 2 Ti and Ti Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. Ti Grade 2 and Ti Grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130V for pure titanium; 100 and 120V for Ti6Al4V alloy. Surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with EDS probe, laser profilometry and X-ray diffractometry. Bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. Osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. The higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130V) and Ti6Al4V alloy (120V) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and Ti6Al4V and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. The observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.
TI  - Impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. However, with the exception of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. Therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. METHODS: We cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with THP-1 monocyte-like cells. We performed 16S rDNA analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic DNA PCR analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether THP-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. RESULTS: We recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with THP-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. On average, tissue homogenates incubated with THP-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (P = 0.02). We recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis, and confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qPCR demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) P. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. Our results suggest revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Stimulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. Eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. METHODS: Microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. Growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. RESULTS: F. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-I collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. Biofilm formation by F. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by P. gingivalis. It was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with P. gingivalis. Enhancement of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxS. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that P. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by F. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in atheromatous plaques by quantitative PCR.
AB  - This is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial DNA from ten species, including periodontal species and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We examined 129 samples of DNA extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from ten different species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola and C. pneumoniae. All determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods employing SYBR Green. Species from the Bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. Almost half of the samples contained DNA from A. a. and C. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. S. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. The proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic DNA. The data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. We conclude that DNA from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of C. pneumoniae to the inflammation may be minimal.
TI  - Innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  - The innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  The human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hBD-2 and hBD-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. Previous studies showed that hBD-2 was induced by Fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the NF-kappaB transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. The goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hBD-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of NF-kappaB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Different bacteria induced different levels of hBD-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal- and pathogen-stimulated cells. hBD-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the JNK and p38 pathways. However, in addition, hBD-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of NF-kappaB. The results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hBD-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans on denture surfaces.
AB  - Infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA,  and Candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. We enumerated MRSA and C. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. Staphylococcus species, MRSA, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSE, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. C. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. All saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried Staphylococcus species and C. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. Adherence of isolated 3H labeled cells of MRSA and C. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. Cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. The hydrophobicity of the MRSA isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of C. albicans strains was moderately high. The zeta potentials of MRSA isolates and of C. albicans isolates determined in KCI buffer were significantly low. The potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. Two out of 5 MRSA strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of Staphylococcus species. No isolates of C. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the oral bacteria tested. Isolates of MRSA and C. albicans coaggregated with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum strains. Using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of Staphylococcus species or C. albicans organisms in saliva.
TI  - The interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. The reference bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (GF) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (E) from 2 such persons, HeLa cells (HeLa), and an amnion cell line (Amnion). The cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a Bioscreen robot analyzer (Labsystems, Finland). Results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Occurrence of enteric rods, staphylococci and Candida in subgingival samples.
AB  - The frequency and percentage of enteric rods, staphylococci and Candida were determined in 973 subgingival samples collected from 535 patients subjected to different periodontal treatment procedures. The analysis was performed with culture technique using selective and nonselective media. One or more organisms were detected in 65.5% of the samples and in 76.7% of the patients. In most samples enteric rods, staphylococci and/or Candida constituted a small amount of the total microbial viable count. Enteric rods exceeded 10% of the total viable count in 30 samples. Staphylococci occurred in more than 10% in only 3 samples. In these 3 samples, enterics constituted more than 10% of the total viable count. Candida was not found to exceed 10% of the total viable count in any of the samples. No statistically significant correlation was found between the presence of any of the target microorganisms and kind of periodontal treatment procedure received, antibiotic administration or sample transport time.
TI  - Bacterial interference in vitro. Comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a Bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar plates. Six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The interference activity was correlated with a reference system of Streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS serotypes T 9 and T 22). The methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. Estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a Bioscreen robot analyzer. Suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of UV light-killed bacteria in liquid media. The Bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. Synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. However, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the S. sanguis strain on the two strains of S. pyogenes. 2. Cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the S. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. The Bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.
TI  - Cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  - Cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by Cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. Interaction studies were made by adding each of the different UV-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. The reference oral bacterial strains were: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 209 and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The target cells were: gingival fibroblasts (GF), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (PMF), pulpal fibroblasts (PF), HeLa-cells (HeLa), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (LN). Synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. The cytotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of P. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of S. aureus it was increased. Bacterial interactions with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. The cytotoxicity of F. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
