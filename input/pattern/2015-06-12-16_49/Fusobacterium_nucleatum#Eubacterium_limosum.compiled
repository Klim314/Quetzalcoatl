TI  - Recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  - A new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16S rRNA sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. The pigmented Prevotella species now comprise seven species including P. nigrescens and P. tannerae; P. intermedia/P. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. The former Mitsuokella dentalis and Hallella seregens were transferred to Prevotella as one species, P. dentalis. P. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting Prevotella. The genus Porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, P. catoniae; P. levii-like and P. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. Fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies, and F. varium includes the former F. pseudonecrophorum. Former Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva now are Campylobacter rectus and Campylobacter curvus; Campylobacter showae is a new species. Isolates included in the bile-sensitive former Bacteroides gracilis now are Campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant B. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, Sutterella, as S. wadsworthensis. The new Actinomyces species include two subspecies of the A. neuii and the A. radingae-A. turicensis complex. The genus Eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by E. limosum, and the former E. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, Pseudoramibacter, as P. alactolyticus. Recent entries include E. saphenum, E. minutum, E. exiguum, E. infirmum, and E. tardum. A new genus, Atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. The genus Peptostreptococcus also have four new species; P. hydrogenalis, P. lacrimalis, P. lactolyticus, and P. vaginalis.
TI  - Coaggregation studies of the Eubacterium species.
AB  - Eubacterium species are gram-positive anaerobic rods that are frequently isolated from subgingival plaque of periodontal pockets. Five Eubacterium species were tested for their ability to coaggregate with 33 oral bacterial strains. Using visual and turbidimetric assays, coaggregation was observed among Eubacterium brachy, Eubacterium nodatum, Eubacterium alactolyticum and Eubacterium limosum strains only when tested with Fusobacterium nucleatum strains; Eubacterium saburreum displayed only weak coaggregation ability. Coaggregation between F. nucleatum and the Eubacterium species was observed over a wide range of concentrations of each organism. The F. nucleatum strains contained a heat labile and the Eubacterium species a heat stabile coaggregation receptor. Arginine, histidine, lysine and glycine inhibited the coaggregation between F. nucleatum and the Eubacterium species. Sugars and other amino acids tested did not inhibit the observed coaggregation. Rabbit anti-F. nucleatum serum completely inhibited coaggregation, but anti-E. brachy serum and normal rabbit serum did not. As these anaerobic microorganisms are frequently isolated from the same oral lesions, the surface interactions observed may be important in the pathogenesis of these polymicrobic infections.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
