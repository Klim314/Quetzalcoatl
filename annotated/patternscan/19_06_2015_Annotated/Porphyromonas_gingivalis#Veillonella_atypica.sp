TI  == a yada-like autotransporter, hag1 in veillonella atypica is a multivalent hemagglutinin involved in adherence to oral streptococci, porphyromonas gingivalis, and human oral buccal cells.
AB  == dental biofilm development is a sequential process, and adherence between microbes and the salivary pellicle (adhesion) as well as among different microbes (co-adhesion or coaggregation) plays a critical role in building a biofilm community. the veillonella species are among the most predominant species in the  oral cavity and coaggregate with many initial, early, middle, and late colonizers. similar to oral fusobacteria, they are also considered bridging species in biofilm development. however, the mechanism of this ability has yet to be reported, due to the previous lack of a genetic transformation system in the entire genus. in this study, we used our recently discovered transformable veillonella strain, veillonella atypica ok5, to probe the mechanism of coaggregation between veillonella species and other oral bacteria. by insertional inactivation of all eight putative hemagglutinin genes, we identified one gene, hag1, which is involved in v. atypica coaggregation with the initial colonizers streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus cristatus, and the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. the hag1 mutant also abolished adherence to human buccal cells. inhibition assays using various chemical or physiological treatments suggest different mechanisms being involved in coaggregation with different partners. the entire hag1 gene was sequenced and shown to be the largest known bacterial hemagglutinin gene.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == characterization of inhibitory effects of suspected periodontopathogens on osteogenesis in vitro.
AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.
