TI  - Population dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of Aeromonas spp. along a salinity gradient in an urban estuary in Northeastern Brazil.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to quantify population and identify culturable species of Aeromonas in sediment and surface water collected along a salinity gradient in an urban estuary in Northeastern Brazil. Thirty sediment samples and 30 water samples were collected from 3 sampling locations (A, B and C) between October 2007 and April 2008. The Aeromonas count was 10-7050CFU/mL (A), 25-38,500CFU/mL (B) and<10CFU/mL (C) for water samples, and approximately 100-37,500CFU/g (A), 1200-43,500CFU/g (B) and<10CFU/g (C) for sediment samples. Five species (Aeromonas caviae, A. sobria, A. trota, A. salmonicida and A. allosaccharophila) were identified among 41 isolates. All strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone, whereas 33 (80, 4%) strains were resistant to at least 2 of the 9 antibiotics tested. Resistance to erythromycin was mostly plasmidial. In conclusion, due to pollution, the Coco River is contaminated by pathogenic strains of Aeromonas spp. with a high incidence of antibacterial resistance, posing a serious risk to human health.
TI  - Re-identification of Aeromonas isolates from rainbow trout and incidence of class 1 integron and beta-lactamase genes.
AB  - Forty-eight Aeromonas isolates from rainbow trout previously identified by the 16S rDNA-RFLP technique were re-identified using 2 housekeeping genes (gyrB and rpoD). After sequencing the prevalences of the species were A. veronii (29.2%), A. bestiarum (20.8%), A. hydrophila (16.7%), A. sobria (10.4%), A. media (8.3%), A. popoffii (6.2%), A. allosaccharophila (2.1%), A. caviae (2.1%), A. salmonicida (2.1%) and one isolate (2.1%) belongs to a candidate new species "Aeromonas lusitana". Coincident identification results to the 16S rDNA-RFLP technique were only obtained for 68.8% of the isolates. PCR amplification of the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC-PCR) indicated that the 48 isolates belonged to 33 different ERIC genotypes. Several genotypes were isolated from different farms and organs in the same fish, indicating a systemic dissemination of the bacteria. The presence of genes (blaIMP, blaCphA/IMIS, blaTEM, blaSHV and intI1) that encode extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) and class 1 integrons were studied by PCR. Only 39.6% (19/48) of the strains showed the presence of one or more resistance genes. The gene blaCphA/IMIS was detected in 29.2% of the isolates, followed by the intI1 (6.2%) and blaSHV (4.2%) genes. The variable region of class 1 integrons of the 3 positive isolates was sequenced revealing the presence of the gene cassette aadA1 (aminoglycoside transferase) that plays a role in streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance.
TI  - Characterization of Aeromonas hydrophila wound pathotypes by comparative genomic  and functional analyses of virulence genes.
AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila has increasingly been implicated as a virulent and antibiotic-resistant etiologic agent in various human diseases. In a previously published case report, we described a subject with a polymicrobial wound infection that included a persistent and aggressive strain of A. hydrophila (E1), as well as a more antibiotic-resistant strain of A. hydrophila (E2). To better understand the differences between pathogenic and environmental strains of A. hydrophila, we conducted comparative genomic and functional analyses of virulence-associated genes of these two wound isolates (E1 and E2), the environmental type strain A. hydrophila ATCC 7966(T), and four other isolates belonging to A. aquariorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, and A. caviae. Full-genome sequencing of strains E1 and E2 revealed extensive differences between the two and strain ATCC 7966(T). The more persistent wound infection strain, E1, harbored coding sequences for a cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act), a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), flagella, hemolysins, and a homolog of exotoxin A found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Corresponding phenotypic analyses with A. hydrophila ATCC 7966(T) and SSU as reference strains demonstrated the functionality of these virulence genes, with strain E1 displaying enhanced swimming and swarming motility, lateral flagella on electron microscopy, the presence of T3SS effector AexU, and enhanced lethality in a mouse model of Aeromonas infection. By combining sequence-based analysis and functional assays, we characterized an A. hydrophila pathotype, exemplified by strain E1, that exhibited increased virulence in a mouse model of infection, likely because of encapsulation, enhanced motility, toxin secretion, and cellular toxicity. IMPORTANCE: Aeromonas hydrophila is a common aquatic bacterium that has increasingly been implicated in serious human infections. While many determinants of virulence have been identified in Aeromonas, rapid identification of pathogenic versus nonpathogenic strains remains a challenge for this genus, as it is for other opportunistic pathogens. This paper demonstrates, by using whole-genome sequencing of clinical Aeromonas strains, followed by corresponding virulence assays, that comparative genomics can be used to identify a virulent subtype of A. hydrophila that is aggressive during human infection and more lethal in a mouse model of infection. This aggressive pathotype contained genes for toxin production, toxin secretion, and bacterial motility that likely enabled its pathogenicity. Our results highlight the potential of whole-genome sequencing to transform microbial diagnostics; with further advances in rapid sequencing and annotation, genomic analysis will be able to provide timely information on the identities and virulence potential of clinically isolated microorganisms.
TI  - Characterization of Aeromonas strains isolated from Indian foods using rpoD gene  sequencing and whole cell protein analysis.
AB  - Aeromonas are responsible for causing gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal infections in humans. Twenty-two Aeromonas strains isolated from different food sources were re-identified up to species level using rpoD gene sequence analysis. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were insufficient to identify Aeromonas till species level. However, incorporation of additional biochemical tests lead to correct identification of 95.5 % strains up to species level. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was useful to identify Aeromonas isolates at the genus level only. Sequences of the rpoD gene showed greater discriminatory power than 16S rRNA gene and provided conclusive discrimination of the strains for which the phenotypic species identification was uncertain. All these 22 strains were accurately identified up to species level by rpoD gene as A. salmonicida (6), A. veronii bv. veronii (4), A. caviae (3), A. hydrophila (2), A. veronii bv. sobria (2), A. jandaei (1), A. trota (1), A. sobria (1), A. allosaccharophila (1) and A. bivalvium (1). All these strains were also characterized using whole cell protein (WCP) analysis by gradient SDS-PAGE and showed different whole cell protein (WCP) profile [22-28 polypeptide bands (~10 to >97 kDa)], indicating high genetic diversity. The present work emphasizes the use of molecular methods such as rpoD gene sequencing along with comprehensive biochemical tests for the rapid and accurate identification of Aeromonas isolates till species level. The WCP profile can be subsequently used to characterize Aeromonas isolates below species level.
TI  - Ribosomal multi-operon diversity: an original perspective on the genus Aeromonas.
AB  - 16S rRNA gene (rrs) is considered of low taxonomic interest in the genus Aeromonas. Here, 195 Aeromonas strains belonging to populations structured by multilocus phylogeny were studied using an original approach that considered Ribosomal Multi-Operon Diversity. This approach associated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to assess rrn operon number and distribution across the chromosome and PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (TTGE) to assess rrs V3 region heterogeneity. Aeromonads harbored 8 to 11 rrn operons, 10 operons being observed in more than 92% of the strains. Intraspecific variability was low or nul except for A. salmonicida and A. aquariorum suggesting that large chromosomic rearrangements might occur in these two species while being extremely rarely encountered in the evolution of other taxa. rrn operon number at 8 as well as PFGE patterns were shown valuable for taxonomic purpose allowing resolution of species complexes. PCR-TTGE revealed a high rate of strains (41.5%) displaying intragenomic rrs heterogeneity. Strains isolated from human samples more frequently displayed intragenomic heterogeneity than strains recovered from non-human and environmental specimens. Intraspecific variability ranged from 0 to 76.5% of the strains. The observation of species-specific TTGE bands, the recovery of identical V3 regions in different species and the variability of intragenomic heterogeneity (1-13 divergent nucleotides) supported the occurrence of mutations and horizontal transfer in aeromonad rrs evolution. Altogether, the presence of a high number of rrn operon, the high proportion of strains harboring divergent rrs V3 region and the previously demonstrated high level of genetic diversity argued in favor of highly adaptative capabilities of aeromonads. Outstanding features observed for A. caviae supported the ongoing process of adaptation to a specialized niche represented by the gut, previously hypothesized. 16S rRNA gene is an informative marker in the genus Aeromonas for both evolutionary and polyphasic taxonomic studies provided that multi-operon fingerprinting approaches are used.
TI  - Phylogenetic diversity of Aeromonas from "alheira," a traditional Portuguese meat product.
AB  - "Alheira" is a traditional smoked meat sausage produced in the north of Portugal, representing an important economic resource for the region. This meat product has been subjected to research studies with the aim of detecting the presence of common foodborne pathogens, but, to our knowledge, isolation of emerging foodborne Aeromonas from alheira has never been previously described. Present work attempts to evaluate the Aeromonas species diversity of 84 isolates of Aeromonas spp. collected from 32 alheira samples. All presumptive Aeromonas isolates were subjected to genotyping by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The isolates presenting a different pattern were subjected to gyrB gene sequencing for species classification, and the species A. hydrophila, A. salmonicida, A. caviae, A. media, and A. allosaccharophila were identified. The Aeromonas species diversity found has not been previously described in any other meat product evaluated in previous studies. It is also important to highlight the presence of A. hydrophila and A. caviae because they were previously associated with illness in humans, including gastroenteritis.
TI  - Multilocus genetics to reconstruct aeromonad evolution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aeromonas spp. are versatile bacteria that exhibit a wide variety of  lifestyles. In an attempt to improve the understanding of human aeromonosis, we investigated whether clinical isolates displayed specific characteristics in terms of genetic diversity, population structure and mode of evolution among Aeromonas spp. A collection of 195 Aeromonas isolates from human, animal and environmental sources was therefore genotyped using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on the dnaK, gltA, gyrB, radA, rpoB, tsf and zipA genes. RESULTS: The MLSA showed a high level of genetic diversity among the population, and multilocus-based phylogenetic analysis (MLPA) revealed 3 major clades: the A. veronii, A. hydrophila and A. caviae clades, among the eleven clades detected. Lower genetic diversity was observed within the A. caviae clade as well as among clinical isolates compared to environmental isolates. Clonal complexes, each of which included a limited number of strains, mainly corresponded to host-associated subsclusters of strains, i.e., a fish-associated subset within A. salmonicida and 11 human-associated subsets, 9 of which included only disease-associated strains. The population structure was shown to be clonal, with modes of evolution that involved mutations in general and recombination events locally. Recombination was detected in 5 genes in the MLSA scheme and concerned approximately 50% of the STs. Therefore, these recombination events could explain the observed phylogenetic incongruities and low robustness. However, the MLPA globally confirmed the current systematics of the genus Aeromonas. CONCLUSIONS: Evolution in the genus Aeromonas has resulted in exceptionally high genetic diversity. Emerging from this diversity, subsets of strains appeared to be host adapted and/or "disease specialized" while the A. caviae clade displayed an atypical tempo of evolution among aeromonads. Considering that A. salmonicida has been described as a genetically uniform pathogen that has adapted to fish through evolution from a variable ancestral population, we hypothesize that the population structure of aeromonads described herein suggested an ongoing process of adaptation to specialized niches associated with different degrees of advancement according to clades and clusters.
TI  - Prevalence, characterization, and antimicrobial resistance of Aeromonas strains from various retail food products in Mumbai, India.
AB  - A total of 154 food samples (chicken, fish, and ready-to-eat sprouts) from various retail outlets in Mumbai, India, were analyzed for the presence of Aeromonas spp. over a period of 2 y (January 2006 to March 2008). Twenty-two Aeromonas isolates belonging to 7 different species were isolated from 18 (11.7%) food samples. The highest percentages of isolation were from chicken (28.6%) followed by fish (20%) and sprout (2.5%) samples. Aeromonas caviae, A. veronii bv. sobria, and A. salmonicida were the most frequently isolated species from sprouts, chicken, and fish samples, respectively. The genes encoding for putative virulence factors, cytotoxic enterotoxin (act), hemolysin (hly), aerolysin (aer), elastase (ahyB), and lipase (lip) were detected using polymerase chain reaction method in 59.1%, 40.9%, 22.7%, 54.5%, and 31.8% of the strains, respectively. The isolated Aeromonas strains were found to be positive for virulence factors, that is, amylase, DNase, gelatinase, protease, and lipase production. More than 60% isolates were also positive for beta-hemolytic activity. All these food isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin and bacitracin, and sensitive to gentamicin, 3rd-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime, cephotaxime, ceftriaxone), and chloramphenicol. Seventeen (77.2%) isolates harbored single and/or multiple plasmids (approximately 5 to >16 kb). The XbaI digestion patterns of chromosomal DNA of these isolates, using pulsed field gel electrophoresis, showed high genetic diversity among these isolates. Our results demonstrate the presence of various Aeromonas spp. with virulence potential and antimicrobial resistance in different food products marketed in Mumbai, India. The potential health risks posed by consumption of these raw or undercooked food products should not be underestimated.
TI  - Identification and epidemiological relationships of Aeromonas isolates from patients with diarrhea, drinking water and foods.
AB  - A collection of Aeromonas isolates obtained over a three-year period in the same  geographic area (Leon, NW of Spain) was characterized by (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis and gyrB gene sequence analysis. The isolates originated from human diarrheal stools (29 isolates), potable water (13 isolates), rabbit meat (13 isolates) and marine fish (5 isolates). The distribution of Aeromonas species varied with the strain source. Aeromonas caviae HG4 and Aeromonas media HG5 were predominant in clinical and water isolates, respectively, whereas motile Aeromonas salmonicida HG3 strains were most frequently found in fish and meat. Molecular typing revealed several genotypic relationships among specific isolate subsets: (i) two clones of A. media HG5 persisted in drinking water over the study period, (ii) different patients harbored identical or closely related clones during several months, and (iii) clonal relatedness was observed in two sets of water and human isolates. The first of these sets comprised nine water isolates and two human A. media HG5 isolates, whereas the other one included a water isolate and a human isolate of A. caviae HG4. The latter finding suggests that Aeromonas transmission in the studied region followed a waterborne route. Interestingly, the three human isolates closely related to water isolates were recovered in a period of four days in June 2006 from non-related patients without underlying medical conditions that tested negative for other enteric pathogens. The data imply the transmission through contaminated water of strains of the A. caviae group that can produce disease in humans.
TI  - Phylogenetic identification of Aeromonas from pigs slaughtered for consumption in slaughterhouses at the North of Portugal.
AB  - In the present study, 710 isolates of Aeromonas spp. have been collected from pig carcasses, diaphragm muscle, faeces, dehairing equipment and water in slaughterhouses at the North of Portugal. The isolates were obtained from a total of 154 samples. All presumptive Aeromonas isolates were subjected to ERIC-PCR analysis and those which presented a different pattern were taken and the species classified by gyrB gene sequencing. We have found the species A. hydrophila, A. salmonicida, A. bestiarum, A. caviae, A. media, A. veronii, A. allosaccharophila, A. simiae and A. aquariorum. To our knowledge, this extent of Aeromonas species diversity has not been previously described from meat or from the slaughter environment, perhaps due to the unreliability of available identification methods. A noticeable level of isolate redundancy (strains with identical gyrB sequence) from different samples collected in different dates was also obtained, indicating that only a few predominant strains of these species persist at the slaughter system. It is also important to emphasise the presence of Aeromonas species previously associated with illness in man.
TI  - The occurrence of Aeromonas in drinking water, tap water and the porsuk river.
AB  - The occurrence of Aeromonas spp. in the Porsuk River, public drinking water and tap water in the City of Eskisehir (Turkey) was monitored. Fresh water samples were collected from several sampling sites during a period of one year. Total 102 typical colonies of Aeromonas spp. were submitted to biochemical tests for species differentiation and of 60 isolates were confirmed by biochemical tests. Further identifications of isolates were carried out first with the VITEK system (BioMe rieux) and then selected isolates from different phenotypes (VITEK types) were identified using the DuPont Qualicon RiboPrinter(R) system. Aeromonas spp. was detected only in the samples from the Porsuk River. According to the results obtained with the VITEK system, our isolates were 13% Aeromonas hydrophila, 37% Aeromonas caviae, 35% Pseudomonas putida, and 15% Pseudomonas acidovorans. In addition Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas maltophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Aeromonas media species were determined using the RiboPrinter(R) system. The samples taken from the Porsuk River were found to contain very diverse Aeromonas populations that can pose a risk for the residents of the city. On the other hand, drinking water and tap water of the City are free from Aeromonas pathogens and seem to be reliable water sources for the community.
TI  - Putative virulence properties of Aeromonas strains isolated from food, environmental and clinical sources in Italy: a comparative study.
AB  - The distribution of virulence properties in 142 strains of Aeromonas isolated from diarrhoeic patients, food and surface water in Italy and identified by biochemical and molecular methods was investigated. The virulence properties studied were the presence of genes for the aerolysin (aerA), heat-stable cytotonic enterotoxin (ast), heat-labile cytotonic enterotoxin (alt), cytotoxic enterotoxin (act); and cytotoxicity for Vero cells and adhesion on Hep-2 cells. A. hydrophila and A. caviae were the species most commonly isolated from clinical and environmental samples (9/30; 30.0% and 5/27; 18.5%, respectively) while mesophilic A. salmonicida was most common in food samples (19/80; 23.7%). Out of 142 strains, 86 (60.6%) were positive for at least one of the virulence properties. All the toxin genes were present in 4/18 (22.3%) of clinical strains. Most of the food isolates (54/55; 98.2%) were cytotoxic and most of the environmental strains (12/13; 92.3%) were adhesive. The aerA gene was present in most toxigenic strains (72/86; 83.7%), irrespective of their origin. The growth temperature affected the expression of cytotoxicity and adhesivity. Aeromonas strains from food and surface water frequently had toxin gene patterns similar to those of clinical strains and expressed virulence properties at human body temperature. These findings indicate that aeromonads have the potential to cause human illness and confirm the role of food and water as vehicles for Aeromonas diseases.
TI  - Mechanisms of quinolone resistance in Aeromonas species isolated from humans, water and eels.
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance were determined in 33 quinolone-resistant isolates of the species Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas caviae, Aeromonas media, Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas popoffii and Aeromonas veronii, recovered from humans, freshwater and eels. The quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC genes were sequenced in these resistant strains, as well as in 8 quinolone-sensitive Aeromonas used as controls. All quinolone-resistant Aeromonas carried point mutations in the gyrA QRDR at codon 83, respectively giving rise to substitutions Ser(83)-->Ile (32 strains) or Ser(83)-->Val (1 strain). Almost half of these isolates (48%) carried additional point mutations in the gyrA QRDR at codon 92 and/or in the parC QRDR at codon 80 corresponding to substitutions Leu(92)-->Met and Ser(80)-->Ile. In all cases, MICs of quinolones were determined in the presence and absence of the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). Addition of PAbetaN had no effect on the levels of resistance observed in these isolates. In conclusion, the mechanism of quinolone resistance in the Aeromonas isolates studied was related to mutations in QRDR regions of gyrA and parC genes, with little obvious involvement of pumps inhibited by PAbetaN.
TI  - A mouse model for characterization of gastrointestinal colonization rates among environmental Aeromonas isolates.
AB  - The colonization rates of 10 different environmental Aeromonas isolates were determined using a novel mouse-streptomycin pretreatment method. As demonstrated, alterations to the colon flora of mice pretreated with streptomycin allowed transient colonization by bacterial species normally excluded by host competition. A novel procedure is described for determining the colonization abilities of Aeromonas isolates under these conditions. The colonization rates of A. salmonicida, A. encheleia, and A. allosaccharophila were either negative or occurred randomly at low levels with respect to concentrations of the dosage consumed by the animals. In contrast, A. hydrophila, A. veronii biovar sobria, and A. caviae exhibited relatively high rates of mouse colon tissue colonization.
TI  - Dominant pathogenic species of mesophilic aeromonads isolated from diseased and healthy fish cultured in Poland.
AB  - Aeromonas isolates were collected from cultured fish, characterized phenotypically and identified to species using 16S rDNA. The pathogenicity of all isolates was assayed on the basis of haemolytic and proteolytic activity and challenge tests were performed for isolates from healthy fish. A total of 131 Aeromonas isolates were obtained and identified as follows: A. hydrophila (13), A. bestiarum (23), A. salmonicida (motile biogroup) (19), A. caviae (2), A. sobria (18), A. veronii bt. sobria (42), A. jandaei (1), A. encheleia (11) and A. allosaccharophila (2). All isolates of A. hydrophila and A. bestiarum and most isolates of A. salmonicida and A. veronii were classified as pathogenic. Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated only from diseased trout except for one isolate obtained from carp fry. The other potentially pathogenic Aeromonas species were present in diseased as well as healthy fish. The pathogenicity of isolates from healthy fish was correlated with their enzymatic activity and was also tested by challenge experiments. The dominant pathogenic species were A. veronii bt. sobria, A. bestiarum and A. salmonicida in common carp and A. hydrophila in rainbow trout.
TI  - Characterization of Aeromonas virulence using an immunocompromised mouse model.
AB  - An immunocompromised mouse model was used to characterize Aeromonas strains for their ability to cause opportunistic, extraintestinal infections. A total of 34 isolates of Aeromonas (A. hydrophila [n = 12]), A. veronii biotype sobria [n = 7], A. caviae [n = 4], A. enchelia [n = 4], A. allosaccharophila [n = 2], A. salmonicida (n = 4), and A. bestiarum [n = 1]) were introduced by intraperitoneal injection into immunocompetent or chemically compromised (using cyclophosphamide) mice. The ability of each isolate to persist in the liver and spleen tissue was monitored at 24 hours after exposure. A majority ofA. hydrophila and A veronii v. sobria strains, but none of the isolates of other Aeromonas species, were capable of persistent colonization (<300 cells/mg spleen and liver tissue at 24 hours). The presence or absence of several putative virulence factors (cytotoxicity to HEp-2, lipase activity, elastase activity, and hemolysis) were determined for each isolate using in vitro tests. There were no correlations between the presence or absence of biochemical test results for putative virulence factors and persistence of the isolate in spleen and liver tissue at 24 hours.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Aeromonas strains isolated from drinking water samples in istanbul, Turkey.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the resistance patterns of Aeromonas spp. in drinking water in Istanbul, Turkey. We investigated a total of 1,680 drinking water samples (840 tap water and 840 domestic water tank samples) for Aeromonas strains between June 2002 and October 2005. A total of 147 Aeromonas strains were isolated from 49 (6%) of 840 tap water samples and from 98 (12%) of 840 domestic water tank samples. Antibiotic susceptibility of Aeromonas strains was determined by the disc diffusion method, according to the CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) recommendation. Among the 147 Aeromonas strains, the prevalence was: A. hydrophila 68 (46%), A. sobria 50 (34%), A. caviae 11 (8%), A. salmonicida 9 (6%), A. veronii 5 (3%) and A. jandaei 4 (3%). Approximately 55% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, 48% to erythromycin, 41% to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 28% to ceftazidime, 27% to cefoxitin, 26% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, 22% to piperacillin, 14% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 12% to tetracycline, 11% to aztreonam, 8% to meropenem, 6% to imipenem, 2% to nalidixic acid, 1% to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and gentamicin. None of the strains were resistant to amikacin and netilmicin. In conclusion, Aeromonas spp. isolated from drinking water in Istanbul have a resistance potential and the antibiotic resistance rates of A. hydrophila, A. sobria and A. caviae were usually higher than those of other Aeromonas strains. It should be kept in mind that these microorganisms in drinking water might be a potential risk for public health.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Numerical analysis of electrophoretic periplasmic protein patterns of Aeromonas sp. strains.
AB  - A total of 103 strains of Aeromonas spp. isolated from clinical and from environmental samples was compared by using SDS-PAGE of periplasmic proteins patterns. Strains isolated from Polish children suffering from gastroenteritis did not appear similar to strains isolated from human living in Hong-Kong. Aeromonas sp. strains did not show a tendency to cluster according to their origin. Our results have demonstrated no species-specific periplasmic protein profiles. A significant protein electrophoretic heterogeneity was observed within the species A. hydrophila, A. bestiarum, A. salmonicida, A. caviae, A. media, and A. veronii biotype sobria.
TI  - Polymorphism of Aeromonas spp. tRNA intergenic spacers.
AB  - We investigated the length polymorphism of the intergenic spacers lying between tRNA genes of Aeromonas spp. A total of 69 strains representing all known genomic species of Aeromonas were used in the study. tDNA-PCR patterns were examined by Dice coefficient (S(D)) and unweighted pair group method of clustering (UPGMA). The strains were allocated into 15 groups at a similarity level of 70%. The strains belonging to seven genomic species: A. hydrophila (HG 1), A. caviae (HG 4), A. sobria (HG 7), A. veronii (HG 8/10), A. encheleia (HG 16), A. popoffii (HG 17), and A. culicicola (HG 18) formed distinct clusters. Our study revealed a genetic heterogeneity of the following species: A. bestiarum, A. salmonicida, A. media, A. eucrenophila, A. jandaei, A. schubertii, and A. allosaccharophila.
TI  - Lack of agreement between biochemical and genetic identification of Aeromonas spp.
AB  - Biochemical and genetic identification by RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the PCR-amplified 16S r-RNA sequence were compared for a selection of 171 clinical and environmental isolates of Aeromonas spp. The investigation revealed large differences between the two methods. The species phenotypic identification scheme and the genetic technique applied to the environmental strains gave divergent results for 96% of the strains tested. There was 46% discrepancy between the two methods for the clinical isolates. The distribution of species differed between clinical and environmental isolates. A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. jandaei and A. veronii dominated the clinical material (81% of isolates by RFLP), whilst only 21% of the environmental isolates belonged to those four species. From the environmental group A. salmonicida, A. bestiarum, A. sobria, A. media, and A. encheleia contributed 72% of the strains tested. The poor parity between the biochemical and the genetic identification of the environmental isolates, and to a lesser extent for the clinical isolates, underlines the fact that our current biochemical methods cannot adequately differentiate Aeromonas spp. This work also shows that the biochemical schemes derived from clinical isolates are incomplete for the identification of environmental strains.
TI  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer of Aeromonas spp.
AB  - We analyzed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) of Aeromonas species. A total of 69 isolates belonging to 18 DNA hybridization groups (HG; equivalent of genomic species) were used in this study. ISRs were amplified by PCR and the products were digested with four restriction endonucleases: Hin6I, Csp6I, TaqI, and TasI. The RFLP patterns obtained after digesting by particular enzymes revealed ISR polymorphism of isolates allocated to individual genomic species. The combined Hin6I, Csp6I, TaqI, and TasI restriction profiles were examined by Dice coefficient (SD) and unweighted pair group method of clustering (UPGMA). The isolates were allocated into 15 groups, three strains were unclustered. The strains belonging to the following genomic species: A. hydrophila, A. bestiarum, A. salmonicida, A. caviae, A. media, A. schubertii, A. allosaccharophila, A. popoffii, and A. culicicola formed distinct clusters. Strains belonging to HG 6, HG 7, HG 11, and HG 16 revealed similar combined RFLP patterns and constituted one group. Similarly, the strains of A. jandaei (HG 9) and the type strain of A. trota were allocated into one cluster. Two isolates of HG 14 formed distinct cluster. We noticed a genetic diversity among A. veronii isolates, the strains were clustered in two groups. Our study showed that combined ISR-RFLP analysis may be used for identification of some species of Aeromonas.
TI  - Typing of clinical and environmental Aeromonas sp. strains by random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR.
AB  - A collection of 120 strains isolated from stool specimens collected from humans suffering from gastroenteritis and from environmental samples were analyzed by random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR (RAPD), repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR), and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR). Species of Aeromonoas hydrophila, A. bestiarum, A. salmonicida, A. caviae, A. media, and A. veronii revealed clonal structure. There was no dominant clone causing gastroenteritis in humans. Moreover, there was no genetic similarity between clinical and environmental strains of Aeromonas sp. isolated from different geographical areas as well as from the same geographical area. Some clones colonized specific ecosystems, e.g., drinking water distribution systems. RAPD and ERIC-PCR methods had the same discriminatory power and proved to be useful for epidemiological investigation and population genetic analysis of Aeromonas spp., whereas REP-PCR was less effective for differentiating the isolates of Aeromonas spp.
TI  - Distribution of Aeromonas spp. as identified by 16S rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in a trout farm.
AB  - AIMS: This study used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with Aeromonas-specific primers to identify species of Aeromonas and to investigate their distribution in a trout farm and stream. METHODS AND RESULTS: In January, May, August and November 2000, presumptive Aeromonas species were recovered from a farm and a sedimentation pond in a fish farm and stream, and identified by PCR-RFLP analysis with Aeromonas-specific primers. The specificity of Aeromonas-specific primers and the suitability of PCR-RFLP analysis for identifying Aeromonas spp. were confirmed with fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and 16S rDNA sequencing analyses, respectively. Levels of Aeromonas spp. sampled in May and August were higher than in January and November at all sampling sites. Aeromonas salmonicida was the dominant species in January and November, and the proportion of pathogenic species (Aer. hydrophila, Aer. caviae and Aer. veronii) increased in May and August. CONCLUSIONS: PCR-RFLP analysis with Aeromonas-specific primers is a rapid and reliable method for identifying widely distributed Aeromonas spp. from environmental samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: To minimize human health risk, monitoring the levels and species composition of Aeromonas in fish farm is advisable.
TI  - Phenotypic study by numerical taxonomy of strains belonging to the genus Aeromonas.
AB  - AIMS: This study was undertaken to cluster and identify a large collection of Aeromonas strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Numerical taxonomy was used to analyse phenotypic data obtained on 54 new isolates taken from water, fish, snails, sputum and 99 type and reference strains. Each strain was tested for 121 characters but only the data for 71 were analysed using the 'SSM' and 'SJ' coefficients, and the UPGMA clustering algorithm. At SJ values of > or = 81.6% the strains clustered into 22 phenons which were identified as Aer. jandaei, Aer. hydrophila, Aer. encheleia, Aer. veronii biogroup veronii, Aer. trota, Aer. caviae, Aer. eucrenophila, Aer. ichthiosmia, Aer. sobria, Aer. allosaccharophila, Aer. media, Aer. schubertii and Aer. salmonicida. The species Aer. veronii biogroup sobria was represented by several clusters which formed two phenotypic cores, the first related to reference strain CECT 4246 and the second related to CECT 4835. A good correlation was generally observed among this phenotypic clustering and previous genomic and phylogenetic data. In addition, three new phenotypic groups were found, which may represent new Aeromonas species. CONCLUSIONS: The phenetic approach was found to be a necessary tool to delimitate and identify the Aeromonas species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Valuable traits for identifying Aeromonas as well as the possible existence of new Aeromonas species or biotypes are indicated.
TI  - Distribution of oxytetracycline resistance plasmids between aeromonads in hospital and aquaculture environments: implication of Tn1721 in dissemination of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet A.
AB  - Oxytetracycline-resistant (OT(r)) mesophilic aeromonads were recovered from untreated hospital effluent (72 isolates) and from fish farm hatchery tanks (91 isolates) at sites within the English Lake District, Cumbria, England. The transfer of OT(r) plasmids from these isolates was investigated. Using Escherichia coli J53-1 as a recipient, 11 isolates from the hospital site and 6 isolates from the fish farm site transferred OT(r) plasmids (designated pFBAOT1 to 17). Original isolates were identified using fatty acid methyl ester and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism comparisons as either Aeromonas hydrophila HG3 (eight isolates), A. veronii b.v. sobria HG8 (six isolates), and A. caviae HGB5 (one isolate). One isolate remained unidentified, and one could not be assigned a taxonomic designation beyond the genus level. Plasmids pFBAOT1 to -17 were screened for the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet A to E and Tet G. Only determinant Tet A (10 plasmids) was detected in these plasmids, with 7 tet gene determinants remaining unclassified. In all cases, Tet A was located on a 5.5-kb EcoRI restriction fragment. Hybridization with inc-rep probes N, P, Q, W, and U showed pFBAOT3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -11, from the hospital environment, to be IncU plasmids. Further, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and DNA probing demonstrated that pFBAOT plasmids were closely related to IncU OT(r) plasmids pASOT, pASOT2, pASOT3, pRAS1 (originally isolated from A. salmonicida strains from fish farms in Scotland and Norway, respectively), and pIE420 (isolated from a German hospital E. coli strain). In addition, DNA analyses demonstrated that plasmids pRAS1 and pIE420 had identical RFLP profiles and that all fragments hybridized to each other. The presence of tetracycline resistance transposon Tn1721 in its entirety or in a truncated form in these plasmids was demonstrated. These results provided direct evidence that related tetracycline resistance-encoding plasmids have disseminated between different Aeromonas species and E. coli and between the human and aquaculture environments in distinct geographical locations. Collectively, these findings provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the aquaculture and human compartments of the environment behave as a single interactive compartment.
TI  - The effect of diet on aerobic bacterial flora associated with intestine of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.).
AB  - In order to extend the knowledge on the possible effect of diet on the gastrointestinal microbial community of fish, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) were fed diets containing high (23.7%) and low (6.4%) levels of carbohydrate. The number of viable aerobic and facultative aerobic bacteria associated with the digestive tract were not influenced by dietary regimen. A wide range of bacterial species was isolated, and the predominant bacterial species of both rearing groups were identified as Staphylococcus. There were, however, some differences in bacterial composition between the rearing groups, as well as inter-individual variations. For example, atypical Aeromonas salmonicida were isolated from the small and large intestine of two fish fed low dietary carbohydrate, while Aer. caviae-like isolates were found in the small intestine of four fish fed high carbohydrate. Non-motile Aeromonas spp. were found in the rearing group fed high dietary carbohydrate, but at low frequencies. Dietary manipulation seemed to influence the species composition of carnobacteria, Gram-positive rods, oxidase and catalase-negative and fermentative metabolism. Carnobacterium piscicola-like bacteria were only found in the small intestine, while C. mobile-like and Carnobacterium spp. were isolated from the large intestine of fish fed high carbohydrate. On the contrary, C. divergens-like isolates were found associated with the small and large intestine of fish fed low dietary carbohydrate.
TI  - Bacteriocin activity and probiotic activity of Aeromonas media.
AB  - Three strains of Aeromonas media (161, A164 and A199) were shown to be active in-vitro producers of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). For example, the producer strain, Aer. media A199, displayed antagonistic activity against all strains tested of Aer. caviae, Aer. hydrophila, Aer. salmonicida, Aer. veronii var. sobria, Listonella anguillarum, Photobacterium damsella, eight species of Vibrio and Yersinia ruckeri. Because of this wide-ranging activity against fish/shellfish pathogens, A199 was chosen for the probiotic work. By contrast, however, the BLIS produced by A199 did not inhibit the growth of Enterococcus seriolicida. The aim of the project was to ascertain whether or not the activity observed in vitro could be repeated in vivo. The ability of BLIS-producing strain A199 to act as a probiotic was assessed on the host animal, Crassostrea gigas, by testing whether or not strain A199 could prevent death of the oyster larvae when challenged with V. tubiashit. Whereas larvae, challenged with the Vibrio, died within 5 days, the presence of both the pathogen and the probiotic strain, together, did not affect the viability of the larvae over the same time period; the viability of larvae challenged with A199 alone was also unaffected when compared with the viability of unchallenged larvae (controls). These findings have important, economic implications for those engaged in the oyster producing industry where heavy losses can be experienced as a result of an infectious outbreak. At this stage, the association between BLIS activity and probiotic activity is circumstantial and, hence, future work will involve the use of non-BLIS-producing strains of Aer. media and BLIS-negative variants of the producer. Moreover, extension of the project will involve the use of other BLIS-producing strains (A161, and A164), hosts (salmon, crayfish, scallops and abalone) and pathogens.
TI  - [The prevalence of Aeromonas spp. in the diarrheal feces of children under the age of 5 years in the city of Goiania, Goias in the 1995-1996 biennium].
AB  - From 1995 through 1996, 163 fecal specimens of children aged under 5 years were analysed, 91 being from diarrhea feces and 72 without diarrhea. The material was collected in transport medium and submitted to the enrichment procedure at 4 degrees C for 7 days. For the primary isolation starch ampicillin agar was used and incubated at 35 degrees C for 18 to 24 hours. Twenty (20.9%) from the following specimens were isolated: Aeromonas (A.) caviae (7.7%), A. salmonicida salmonicida (6.6%), A. sobria (4.3%), A. hydrophila (2.2%) and Salmonicida achromogenes (1.1%). No Aeromonas spp. was isolated from the 72 control subjects. The Aeromonas spp. susceptibility to antimicrobial was greater with ciprofloxacin, being this susceptibility gradually diminished with chloranphenicol, gentamicin, ampicillin and erythromycin.
TI  - Study of the intergenic exeF-exeG region and its application as a simple preliminary test for Aeromonas spp.
AB  - The exeF-exeG intergenic regions from different hybridization groups (HG) of Aeromonas were studied by PCR amplification using a single pair of primers. Six main classes of PCR products were identified according to size: 360 bp, 320 bp, 280 bp, 230-240 bp, 220 bp and 160 bp. Direct sequencing of the PCR products indicated that the shorter intergenic regions had probably originated from deletion of DNA segments between direct repeats. Correlation of certain PCR products with Aeromonas caviae (HG4), A. caviae (HG5), A. veronii (HG8) and A. salmonicida (HG3) was revealed. The PCR reaction was also shown to be generally specific for Aeromonas spp. Thus, the usefulness of this rapid, single colony-based PCR test for both identification and preliminary differentiation of Aeromonas spp. is demonstrated.
TI  - Maximum growth temperature ranges of Aeromonas Spp. isolated from clinical or environmental sources.
AB  - Only a limited number of phenotypic tests are available for the differentiation of all 13 known hybridization groups (HG) of Aeromonas spp. These organisms have a wide spectrum of warm-blooded and cold-blooded hosts. In the present study, the maximum growth temperatures (tmax) of the most common HGs of Aeromonas spp. originating from human fecal samples, food, water, and healthy and diseased fish were determined with a plate-type continuous temperature-gradient incubator. We observed that determination of the tmax can be applied for differentiation of HG 1 from HG 2 and 3 (phenospecies A. hydrophila); HG 6 from HG 4, 5A, and 5B (phenospecies A. caviae); HG 7 from HG 8/10 (phenospecies A. sobria); and HG 11 from HG 8/10 (phenospecies A. veronii). HG 1, 4, 8/10, and 13 strains occurring also in human clinical samples had a high tmax, about 40 degrees C or higher. Hybridization group 2, 3, 5A, and 5B strains, which in most cases originated from water or food, had tmax values in the range of about 36-39 degrees C, while HG 6, 7, and 11 had tmax values in the range of about 33-37 degrees C. Fish pathogenic strains of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida and subsp. achromogenes had the lowest tmax values from about 30 to 35 degrees C.
TI  - [The amine-forming ability of Aeromonas spp].
AB  - Motile Aeromonas (A.) species are considered international more and more as potential food poisoning organisms. Their ability to produce biogenic amines, products of metabolism, which in case can cause a disease, was only searched insufficiently till now. 50 strains of the species A.hydrophila, A.sobria, A.caviae and the non-motile species A.salmonicida were included in the tests for amine producing potency. Qualitative investigations to the formation of histamine, tryptamine, and tyramine were ensued by the help of thin layer chromatography. Quantitative investigations were only done in respect of the production of tyramine, which had been proved qualitatively in several strains, while histamine and tryptamine were not produced. Concentrations of tyramine with foodhygienic relevance were found out partially.
TI  - Studies on the hemagglutinant activity of some Aeromonas strains.
AB  - 216 strains to Aeromonas genus (158 A. hydrophila, 33 A. salmonicida, 23 A. sobria, 1 A. caviae and 1 A. veronii strains) of different sources of isolation were studied concerning their hemagglutinating behaviour to 5 different erythrocyte species (human, bovine, chicken, African green monkey and guinea pig) in the presence/absence of mannose/fucose. The study aimed to establish the spectrum of their hemagglutinating activity and any possible correlation between the source of isolation, biochemical phenotype LDC VP and HA type/subtype. Different aspects of HA type/subtype and phenotype LDC VP of Aeromonas strains are discussed. Four Aeromonas hydrophila strains isolated from pig enteritis exhibited constantly FRHA to bovine erythrocytes suggesting a possible correlation between virulence and HA type of the respective strains.
TI  - Hemolytic properties of some Aeromonas strains.
AB  - Considering the possible correlation between hemolytic and enterotoxigenic properties of Aeromonas strains mentioned in the literature, in the present work we studied the practical value of the hemolysis tests in the diagnosis of Aeromonas strains by using comparatively the hemolysis tube tests (with goat and sheep erythrocytes suspensions) as well as the technique on blood agar in aerobic conditions. There were studied comparatively 230 Aeromonas strains (different species: A. hydrophila, A. sobriae, A. caviae, A. veronii, A. salmonicida) isolated from different sources (meat products, fish of fresh waters, mussels, sea water, pipe water, diarrhoeal disease and animal faeces). The comparison among the used tests for proving the hemolytic activity of Aeromonas strains showed that: 61.89% and 56.51% from the total number of Aeromonas strains were hemolytic in the tube tests with 1% goat and 1% sheep erythrocytes suspensions respectively after 48 hrs followed by 51.72% and 48.25% strains by the 5% goat and 5% sheep blood agar plates respectively in anaerobiosis and after 48 hrs incubation at 37 degrees C. The highest incidence of hemolysin presence was pointed out in motile Aeromonas strains (A. hydrophila--60.11% and A. sobria--56.52%). Our results showing a high frequency of hemolytic activity among Aeromonas strains isolated especially in meat products are suggesting a possible correlation between the pathogenic potential and the hemolytic activity and are pleading for introduction of this test in the diagnosis of Aeromonas species.
TI  - The pathogenicity of Aeromonas strains relative to genospecies and phenospecies identification.
AB  - The relative pathogenicity of 80 Aeromonas strains typed by biochemical (phenospecies) and genetic (genospecies) methods was assessed by determining the 50% lethal dose for each isolate in Swiss-Webster mice by intraperitoneal injection. Overall, the maximum difference in virulence potential observed between the least and most pathogenic strains was a four log (10,000-fold) difference. Results according to phenospecies designation supported previous investigations indicating that both A. hydrophila and A. sobria are inherently more pathogenic for mice than A. caviae. According to genospecies designation, the relative virulence of individual groups in decreasing order was as follows: HG 9 (A. jandaei) greater than HG 1 (A. hydrophila) and HG 12 (A. schubertii) greater than HG 10 (A. veronii biotype veronii) greater than HG 8 (A. veronii biotype sobria) greater than HG 11 (unnamed) greater than HG 2 (unnamed) greater than HG 3 (A. salmonicida), HG 4 (A. caviae) and HG 6 (A. eucrenophila) greater than HG 5 (A. media) greater than HG 7 (A. sobria).
TI  - Aeromonas trota sp. nov., an ampicillin-susceptible species isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Previous DNA hybridization studies established 12 Aeromonas genospecies, from which nine phenotypic species have been proposed: Aeromonas hydrophila, A. sobria, A. caviae, A. media, A. veronii, A. schubertii, A. salmonicida, A. eucrenophila, and A. jandaei. We have delineated a new Aeromonas genospecies, A. trota, on the basis of 13 strains isolated primarily from fecal specimens from southern and southeastern Asia. All strains were highly related to the proposed type strain, AH2 (ATCC 49657T): 51 to 100% (60 degrees C) and 49 to 99% (75 degrees C), with 0.2 to 2.2 divergence. AH2 was only 16 to 41% (60 degrees C) related to all other Aeromonas type strains and DNA group definition strains. The unique profile of A. trota includes negative reactions for esculin hydrolysis, arabinose fermentation, and the Voges-Proskauer test, positive reactions for cellobiose fermentation, lysine decarboxylation, and citrate utilization, and susceptibility to ampicillin, as determined by the broth microdilution MIC method and the Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion method (10 micrograms). Nine of the A. trota strains were from a single study of 165 geographically diverse aeromonads. This finding questions the efficacy of screening fecal specimens for Aeromonas spp. with ampicillin-containing media and suggests a previously unrecognized prevalence of this new species.
TI  - [The Aeromonas genus].
AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila manifested itself since its discovery in 1891 as a pathogen  of cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals and man. Aeromonads cause intestinal and non-intestinal disease. The genus Aeromonas comprises: A. hydrophila, A. sorbria, A. caviae, A. veronii, A. schubertii, i.e. mesophilie species and as to psychrophilie immobile species. A. salmonicida and A. media. For warm-blooded animals and man mesophilie motile species are important as pathogens. A. veronii is an ornithine-decarboxylase positive species, A. schubertii is mannitol-negative, A. caviae is non-haemolytic and VP-negative. It is difficult to differentiate. A. hydrophila with aerogenic and anaerogenic strains from A. sobria. Several practical differential diagnostic tests were suggested by Janda et al. and Joseph et al.: hydrolysis of esculine, KCN, arabinose and salicin are usually positive in A. hydrophila, in A. sobria usually negative. Existing species of mesophilie aeromonads, however, do not correspond to some strains which are found. Therefore Arduino et al. divided their aeromonads into DNA-hybridization groups: for A. hydrophila there were 5, for A. caviae 2 and for A. sobria 1 hybridization group. Biochemisal characteristics corresponded to the hybridization groups. For isolation of aeromonads from faeces selective media with ampicillin must be used and possibly enrichment in alkaline peptone water. Evidence of pathogenity factors is similar as in E. coli,: detection of adhesins and enterotoxin or cytotoxin by means of tests commonly used in cholera and E. coli. The types of adhesins are differentiated by means of fucose- galactose- and mannose resistant haemagglutination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [New enteropathogens: Aeromonas spp].
AB  - Aeromonas is one of the type of enteric pathogens which is commonly present in less developed countries. It leads to acute diarrhea in children and traveller's diarrhea in adults. Additionally it is also responsible from the extraintestinal infections. Aeromonas hydrophila is a bacteria which is isolated from water, soil, foods and rarely from intestinal tract of human. Aeromonas sobria is especially isolated from wound infection of scuba diver's. There are other types of Aeromonas such as salmonicida, punctata, caviae, masoucida and achromogenes.
TI  - Ecology and importance of bacterial' species of the family Vibrionaceae.
AB  - The bacterial species of the family Vibrionaceae, particularly the species of the genus Aeromonas (A. hydrophila and A. punctata and their subspecies were found to be relatively common in the running surface water in Czechoslovakia (the occurrence of A. salmonicida species was not studied). The strains of the so-called NAG-vibrios (Vibrio cholerae unrelated to the cholera vibrio 0 group 1) were also relatively frequent, but the positive isolates of Plesiomonas shigelloides were sporadic. The above described bacterial species occurred also in municipal sewage water and the strains of the Aeromonas genus were identified even in the drinking water of some wells and in foods. In the biological specimens from the human sources, namely in the feces of patients with diarrheal diseases, in secreta from the respiratory pathways, in the urine and occasionally in other material, there prevailed strains of the genus Aeromonas, especially A. hydrophila subsp. hydrophila and A. punctata subsp. caviae. Among the isolates from foods A. punctata subsp. caviae predominated. Positive isolates of the Aeromonas strains from the intestinal contents of cattle, domestic animals and some synantropic birds were rare. Importantly, a relatively great part of the isolates obtained from various sources (including the strains isolated from well water and foods) showed enterotoxigenic properties. The enterotoxigenicity was also observed in a great number of NAG-vibrio strains and in strains of Plesiomonas shigelloides. The occurrence of vibrios in the examined animal species was sporadic.
TI  - Enterotoxigenicity of aeromonas strains in suckling mice.
AB  - The enterotoxigenicity of 170 Aeromonas strains isolated from different sources (food poisoning, random food sampling, water, faeces) was examined by the suckling mouse test. The strains were grown on Syncaye culture medium covered with sterilized membrane for Kiil-kidney. The culture supernatants were inoculated orally. Ileal loop dilatation was compared to that produced by the international standard enterotoxic Escherichia coli B7A (O148 : H28) and B2C (O6 : H16) strains. Of the 87 Aeromonas hydrophila strains 69, of the 76 Aeromonas punctate subsp. caviae strains 9, the 6 Aeromonas punctata subsp. punctata strains 5, and 1 Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes gave a positive reaction in the test.
