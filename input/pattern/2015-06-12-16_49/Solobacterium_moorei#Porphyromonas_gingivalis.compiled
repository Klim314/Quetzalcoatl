TI  - In vitro growth characteristics and volatile sulfur compound production of Solobacterium moorei.
AB  - Solobacterium moorei has recently been implicated as a causative agent of halitosis. In vitro experiments to evaluate the role of S. moorei in halitosis have, however, been complicated by a paucity of information on the ideal conditions for culturing this organism. This work aimed to optimize a liquid culture medium for S. moorei, and to determine the growth-curve of the organism. Further, the ability of S. moorei to generate volatile sulfur compounds was investigated and compared quantitatively to other oral anaerobes by an optimized head-space gas chromatography method. Serum-supplementation of standard liquid growth media gave greater growth of S. moorei than non-supplemented broths, with the best medium found to be serum-supplemented tryptone soya broth. S. moorei was able to metabolize cysteine directly to hydrogen sulfide, but was unable to produce methanethiol from methionine. S. moorei produced 2-3 times more hydrogen sulfide (normalized for colony forming units) than Porphyromonas gingivalis and Veillonella dispar, but considerably less than Fusobacterium nucleatum. The study has identified reliable growth conditions for culture of S. moorei, which were employed to show that S. moorei has the requisite biochemistry consistent with a potential role in halitosis.
TI  - Characterization of volatile sulfur compound production by Solobacterium moorei.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Solobacterium moorei is a Gram positive bacterium that has been specifically associated with halitosis. The aim of this study was to characterize volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production by S. moorei. METHODS: S. moorei was either grown or incubated in the presence of various supplements prior to determining VSC production with a Halimeter sulfide monitor. The effect of exogenous proteases or glycosidase inhibitors on VSC production by S. moorei was examined. RESULTS: We first showed that S. moorei can convert cysteine into hydrogen sulfide. The capacity of S. moorei to produce VSCs from serum, saliva, and mucin was dependent on the presence of an exogenous source of proteases such as pancreatic trypsin or Porphyromonas gingivalis gingipains. VSC production from mucin was inhibited by the presence of a beta-galactosidase inhibitor, thus suggesting that deglycosylation of mucin by S. moorei is critical for VSC production. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that S. moorei can be a major source of malodorous compounds in halitosis by producing VSCs through a process involving the beta-galactosidase activity of the bacterium and an exogenous source of proteases.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two commercially available 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouthrinses with or without alcohol and examined its antimicrobial activity on oral bacterial species including fresh clinical isolates compared to a chlorhexidine mouthrinse and a control fluoride mouthrinse without CPC. Two different approaches were used to evaluate antimicrobial activity. First, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for each mouthrinse against a panel of 25 micro-organisms including species associated with dental caries, gingivitis and periodontitis. Second, supragingival dental plaque obtained from 15 adults was incubated with the four mouthrinses to evaluate antimicrobial activity on micro-organisms in oral biofilms. Both CPC mouthrinses exhibited lower MIC's, that is, greater antimicrobial activity, against oral Gram-negative bacteria especially periodontal pathogens and species implicated in halitosis such as Aggregatibacter actinomycemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Solobacterium moorei than the control mouthrinse. Ex-vivo tests on supragingival plaque micro-organisms demonstrated significantly greater antimicrobial activity by the CPC mouthrinses (>90% killing, P < 0.001) and the chlorhexidine rinse (>98% killing, P < 0.05) compared to the control fluoride mouthrinse. Whilst the chlorhexidine mouthrinse was most effective, mouthrinses containing 0.05% CPC formulated with or without alcohol demonstrated broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both laboratory strains and supragingival plaque bacteria compared to a control mouthrinse without CPC. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: These in vitro and ex-vivo studies provide a biological rationale for previous clinical studies demonstrating the efficacy of CPC mouthrinses in reducing supragingival plaque and plaque-associated gingivitis.
TI  - Effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) against periodontal disease-causing Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) against periodontal disease-causing Fusobacterium nucleatum. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four White Leghorn hens (120 days old) were immunized with whole Fus. nucleatum cells killed with 1% formaldehyde using three injections provided at 2-week intervals. IgY was produced from egg yolks obtained from these immunized hens using water dilution, two-step salt precipitation and ultrafiltration. This IgY was shown to have a purity of 86.8% based on its optical intensity in the stained SDS-PAGE bands. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated a high specificity for the IgY against Fus. nucleatum with a maximum antibody titre of 80 000. The IgY had only weak cross-reactivity with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Solobacterium moorei. Growth and biofilm formation by Fus. nucleatum were inhibited by IgY at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg ml(-1) . Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscope assays revealed a high binding ability of specific IgY, which may explain the in vitro effectiveness of IgY. In an in vivo study, IgY treatment resulted in a marked decrease in alveolar bone loss after Fus. nucleatum infection in a mouse model confirming the effectiveness of IgY against periodontal disease-causing Fus. nucleatum. CONCLUSIONS: IgY effectively inhibited growth and biofilm formation by Fus. nucleatum and prevented the progression of periodontal disease by decreasing alveolar bone loss. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Specific IgY may have potential for the treatment of periodontal disease.
TI  - Reduction of bacterial volatile sulfur compound production by licoricidin and licorisoflavan A from licorice.
AB  - Halitosis affects a large proportion of the population and is, in most cases, caused by the production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), particularly methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide, by specific bacterial species colonizing the oral cavity. In this study, a supercritical extract of Chinese licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and its major isoflavans, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were investigated for their effect on growth, VSC production and protease activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Solobacterium moorei, which have been associated with halitosis. The effects of licorice extract, licoricidin, and licorisoflavan A on VSC production in a saliva model were also tested. We first showed that licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, and to a lesser extent the licorice extract, were effective in inhibiting the growth of all three bacterial species, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the range of 2-80 microg ml(-1). The licorice extract and the two isolates licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were able to dose-dependently reduce VSC production by P. gingivalis, Prev. intermedia, and S. moorei as well as by a human saliva model. Although the extract and isolates did not inhibit the proteolytic activity of bacteria, they blocked the conversion of cysteine into hydrogen sulfide by Prev. intermedia. Lastly, the deodorizing effects of the licorice extract, licoricidin, and licorisoflavan A were demonstrated, as they can neutralize P. gingivalis-derived VSCs. Licorisoflavan A (10 microg ml(-1)) was found to be the most effective by reducing VSC levels by 50%. Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that a licorice supercritical extract and its major isoflavans (licoricidin and licorisoflavan A) represent natural ingredients with a potential for reducing bacterial VSC production and therefore for controlling halitosis.
TI  - A 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  - AIM: Supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. This study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (GI) on dental implants and peri-implant tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. At baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, GI and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: Subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). There were significantly fewer Gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Solobacterium moorei, and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: Twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and GI.
TI  - Analysis of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis using 16S rRNA gene clone library.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis (PI) is an inflammatory disease which leads to the destruction of soft and hard tissues around osseointegrated implants. The subgingival microbiota appears to be responsible for peri-implant lesions and although the complexity of the microbiota has been reported in PI, the microbiota responsible for PI has not been identified. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the microbiota in subjects who have PI, clinically healthy implants, and periodontitis-affected teeth using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis to clarify the microbial differences. DESIGN: Three subjects participated in this study. The conditions around the teeth and implants were evaluated based on clinical and radiographic examinations and diseased implants, clinically healthy implants, and periodontally diseased teeth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets using sterile paper points. Prevalence and identity of bacteria was analyzed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library technique. RESULTS: A total of 112 different species were identified from 335 clones sequenced. Among the 112 species, 51 (46%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 22 were novel phylotypes. The numbers of bacterial species identified at the sites of PI, periodontitis, and periodontally healthy implants were 77, 57, and 12, respectively. Microbiota in PI mainly included Gram-negative species and the composition was more diverse when compared to that of the healthy implant and periodontitis. The phyla Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, and Synergistetes were only detected at PI sites, as were Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Solobacterium moorei. Low levels of periodontopathic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were seen in peri-implant lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The biofilm in PI showed a more complex microbiota when compared to periodontitis and periodontally healthy teeth, and it was mainly composed of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Common periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in PI.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
