TI  - Myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. There are three myeloperoxidase isoforms: MPO I, MPO II and MPO III. We examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Streptococcus sanguis. Isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-A-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. Most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in MPO I and diminished in MPO III. Exceptionally, serum-opsonized A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. Because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests based upon myeloperoxidase.
TI  - Novel FNR homologues identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Based upon DNA sequence data and positive immunochemical reactivity of expressed  protein, novel homologues of the FNR family were identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The similarity to E. coli FNR and to HlyX (itself 71% similar to E. coli FNR, while regulating expression of hemolysin operon in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) was estimated from the deduced partial amino acid sequence to be, in the above order of tested species, 98, 98, 86, and 85%, and 75, 75, 88, and 88%, respectively. The phylogenetic relatedness indicates a rather closer link of HlyX to the FNR homologues from both pathogens, H. aphrophilus and A. actinomycetemcomitans. The possibility that the A. actinomycetemcomitans FNR homologue functions as a redox-sensing transcriptional factor to regulate, in addition to anaerobic respiration, microaerobic expression of the leukotoxin operon (ltx gene) is suggested.
