TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == effect of using propionic acid bacteria as an adjunct culture in yogurt production.
AB  == propionibacteria are able to produce a wide variety of food components beneficial to human health. in this study, yogurt was produced by using the adjunct starter  cultures propionibacterium jensenii b1264 and propionibacterium thoenii (jensenii) p126. although the total solids and protein contents of the yogurts did not show any significant differences, titratable acidity of the control sample (yc-380) remained lower than that of propionibacterium spp.-supplemented yogurts during 15 d of storage. the yogurts produced by yc-380 + p126 cultures had the firmest structure (0.26 n). the highest acetaldehyde (29.35 mg/kg) content was obtained with yogurt made with yc-380 + p126 + b1264 on d 1. the addition of propionibacteria to yogurt did not have any negative effect on the counts of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in yogurt. during the first week of storage, propionibacteria counts remained high, suggesting that yogurt provided a good environment for these organisms. this new product would provide not only beneficial health effects, but also a new alternative product to plain set-type yogurt.
