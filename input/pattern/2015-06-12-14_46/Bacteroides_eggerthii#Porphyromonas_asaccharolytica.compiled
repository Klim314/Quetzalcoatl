TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
