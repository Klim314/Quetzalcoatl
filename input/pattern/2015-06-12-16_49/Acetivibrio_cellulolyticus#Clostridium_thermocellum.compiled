TI  - Engineered platform for bioethylene production by a cyanobacterium expressing a chimeric complex of plant enzymes.
AB  - Ethylene is an industrially important compound, but more sustainable production methods are desirable. Since cellulosomes increase the ability of cellulolytic enzymes by physically linking the relevant enzymes via dockerin-cohesin interactions, in this study, we genetically engineered a chimeric cellulosome-like complex of two ethylene-generating enzymes from tomato using cohesin-dockerins from the bacteria Clostridium thermocellum and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus. This complex was transformed into Escherichia coli to analyze kinetic parameters and enzyme complex formation and into the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which was then grown with and without 0.1 mM isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. Only at minimal protein expression levels (without IPTG), the chimeric complex produced 3.7 times more ethylene in vivo than did uncomplexed enzymes. Thus, cyanobacteria can be used to sustainably generate ethylene, and the synthetic enzyme complex greatly enhanced production efficiency. Artificial synthetic enzyme complexes hold great promise for improving the production efficiency of other industrial compounds.
TI  - Genome-wide analysis of acetivibrio cellulolyticus provides a blueprint of an elaborate cellulosome system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial degradation of plant cell walls and its conversion to sugars and other byproducts is a key step in the carbon cycle on Earth. In order to process heterogeneous plant-derived biomass, specialized anaerobic bacteria use an elaborate multi-enzyme cellulosome complex to synergistically deconstruct cellulosic substrates. The cellulosome was first discovered in the cellulolytic thermophile, Clostridium thermocellum, and much of our knowledge of this intriguing type of protein composite is based on the cellulosome of this environmentally and biotechnologically important bacterium. The recently sequenced genome of the cellulolytic mesophile, Acetivibrio cellulolyticus, allows detailed comparison of the cellulosomes of these two select cellulosome-producing bacteria. RESULTS: Comprehensive analysis of the A. cellulolyticus draft genome sequence revealed a very sophisticated cellulosome system. Compared to C. thermocellum, the cellulosomal architecture of A. cellulolyticus is much more extensive, whereby the genome encodes for twice the number of cohesin- and dockerin-containing proteins. The A. cellulolyticus genome has thus evolved an inflated number of 143 dockerin-containing genes, coding for multimodular proteins with distinctive catalytic and carbohydrate-binding modules that play critical roles in biomass degradation. Additionally, 41 putative cohesin modules distributed in 16 different scaffoldin proteins were identified in the genome, representing a broader diversity and modularity than those of Clostridium thermocellum. Although many of the A. cellulolyticus scaffoldins appear in unconventional modular combinations, elements of the basic structural scaffoldins are maintained in both species. In addition, both species exhibit similarly elaborate cell-anchoring and cellulosome-related gene- regulatory elements. CONCLUSIONS: This work portrays a particularly intricate, cell-surface cellulosome system in A. cellulolyticus and provides a blueprint for examining the specific roles of the various cellulosomal components in the degradation of complex carbohydrate substrates of the plant cell wall by the bacterium.
TI  - Saccharofermentans acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from sludge treating brewery wastewater.
AB  - A spore-forming anaerobic bacterium, designated strain P6(T), was isolated from the sludge of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating brewery wastewater. Cells were Gram-positive, oval and 0.6-0.9 mum by 1.2-1.8 mum in size. Growth was observed at 20-42 degrees C and at pH 5.0-7.5. It fermented several hexoses, polysaccharides and alcohols. Sucrose and aesculin could also be fermented. The main end products of fermentation from glucose were acetate, lactate and fumarate; trace CO(2) and H(2) were also produced. The DNA G+C content of strain P6(T) was 55.6 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(14 : 0) 3-OH. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain P6(T) represented a novel phyletic sublineage in clostridial cluster III, and showed <91 % similarity to the type strains of recognized species in this cluster. Phenotypically, the new isolate was distinguished from its phylogenetic relatives (e.g. Clostridium straminisolvens, Clostridium thermocellum, Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and Clostridium aldrichii) by producing acid from glucose and its inability to degrade cellulose. On the basis of evidence from this polyphasic study, strain P6(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Saccharofermentans acetigenes gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Saccharofermentans acetigenes is P6(T) (=JCM 14006(T) =AS 1.5064(T)).
TI  - Novel architecture of family-9 glycoside hydrolases identified in cellulosomal enzymes of Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and Clostridium thermocellum.
AB  - We have sequenced a new gene, cel9B, encoding a family-9 cellulase from a cellulosome-producing bacterium, Acetivibrio cellulolyticus. The gene includes a signal peptide, a family-9 glycoside hydrolases (GH9) catalytic module, two family-3 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM3c-CBM3b tandem dyad) and a C-terminal dockerin module. An identical modular arrangement exists in two putative GH9 genes from the draft sequence of the Clostridium thermocellum genome. The three homologous CBM3b modules from A. cellulolyticus and C. thermocellum were overexpressed, but, surprisingly, none bound cellulosic substrates. The results raise fundamental questions concerning the possible role(s) of the newly described CBMs. Phylogenetic analysis and preliminary site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the catalytic module and the CBM3 dyad are distinctive in their sequences and are proposed to constitute a new GH9 architectural theme.
TI  - [Clostridium alkalicellum sp. nov., an obligately alkaliphilic cellulolytic bacterium from a soda lake in the Baikal region].
AB  - The first anaerobic alkaliphilic cellulolytic microorganism has been isolated from the Verkhnee Beloe soda lake (Buryatiya, Russia) with pH 10.2 and a salt content of up to 24 g/l. Five strains were characterized. Strain Z-7026 was chosen as the type strain. The cells of the isolate are gram-positive spore-forming rods. A mucous external capsule is produced. The microorganism is obligately alkaliphilic, growing in a pH range of 8.0-10.2, with an optimum at pH 9.0. Sodium ions and, in carbonate-buffered media, sodium chloride are obligately required. The microorganism is slightly halophilic; it grows at 0.017-0.4 M Na+ with an optimum at 0.15-0.3 M Na+. The metabolism is fermentative and strictly anaerobic. Cellulose, cellobiose, and xylan can be used as growth substrates. Plant and algal debris can be fermented. Lactate, ethanol, acetate, hydrogen, and traces of formate are produced during cellulose or cellobiose fermentation. Yeast extract or vitamins are required for anabolic purposes. The microorganism fixes dinitrogen and is nitrogenase-positive. It is tolerant to up to 48 mM Na2S. Growth is not inhibited by kanamycin or neomycin. Chloramphenicol, streptomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, ampiox, bacillin, novobiocin, and bacitracin suppress growth. The DNA G+C content is 29.9 mol %. According to the nucleotide sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, strain Z-7026 is phylogenetically close to the neutrophilic cellulolytic bacteria Clostridium thermocellum (95.5%), C. aldrichii (94.9%), and Acetivibrio cellulolyticus (94.8%). It is proposed as a new species: Clostridium alkalicellum sp. nov.
TI  - A novel cellulosomal scaffoldin from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus that contains a family 9 glycosyl hydrolase.
AB  - A novel cellulosomal scaffoldin gene, termed cipV, was identified and sequenced from the mesophilic cellulolytic anaerobe Acetivibrio cellulolyticus. Initial identification of the protein was based on a combination of properties, including its high molecular weight, cellulose-binding activity, glycoprotein nature, and immuno-cross-reactivity with the cellulosomal scaffoldin of Clostridium thermocellum. The cipV gene is 5,748 bp in length and encodes a 1,915-residue polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 199,496. CipV contains an N-terminal signal peptide, seven type I cohesin domains, an internal family III cellulose-binding domain (CBD), and an X2 module of unknown function in tandem with a type II dockerin domain at the C terminus. Surprisingly, CipV also possesses at its N terminus a catalytic module that belongs to the family 9 glycosyl hydrolases. Sequence analysis indicated the following. (i) The repeating cohesin domains are very similar to each other, ranging between 70 and 90% identity, and they also have about 30 to 40% homology with each of the other known type I scaffoldin cohesins. (ii) The internal CBD belongs to family III but differs from other known scaffoldin CBDs by the omission of a 9-residue stretch that constitutes a characteristic loop previously associated with the scaffoldins. (iii) The C-terminal type II dockerin domain is only the second such domain to have been discovered; its predicted "recognition codes" differ from those proposed for the other known dockerins. The putative calcium-binding loop includes an unusual insert, lacking in all the known type I and type II dockerins. (iv) The X2 module has about 60% sequence homology with that of C. thermocellum and appears at the same position in the scaffoldin. (v) Unlike the other known family 9 catalytic modules of bacterial origin, the CipV catalytic module is not accompanied by a flanking helper module, e.g., an adjacent family IIIc CBD or an immunoglobulin-like domain. Comparative sequence analysis of the CipV functional modules with those of the previously sequenced scaffoldins provides new insight into the structural arrangement and phylogeny of this intriguing family of microbial proteins. The modular organization of CipV is reminiscent of that of the CipA scaffoldin from C. thermocellum as opposed to the known scaffoldins from the mesophilic clostridia. The phylogenetic relationship of the different functional modules appears to indicate that the evolution of the scaffoldins reflects a collection of independent events and mechanisms whereby individual modules and other constituents are incorporated into the scaffoldin gene from different microbial sources.
