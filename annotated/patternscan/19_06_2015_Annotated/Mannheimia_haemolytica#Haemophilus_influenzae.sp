TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == molecular signatures (conserved indels) in protein sequences that are specific for the order pasteurellales and distinguish two of its main clades.
AB  == the members of the order pasteurellales are currently distinguished primarily on  the basis of their branching in the rrna trees and no convincing biochemical or molecular markers are known that distinguish them from all other bacteria. the genome sequences for 20 pasteurellaceae species/strains are now publicly available. we report here detailed analyses of protein sequences from these genomes to identify conserved signature indels (csis) that are specific for either all pasteurellales or its major clades. we describe more than 23 csis in widely distributed genes/proteins that are uniquely shared by all sequenced pasteurellaceae species/strains but are not found in any other bacteria. twenty-one additional csis are also specific for the pasteurellales except in some of these cases homologues were not detected in a few species or the csi was  also present in an isolated non-pasteurellaceae species. the sequenced pasteurellaceae species formed two distinct clades in a phylogenetic tree based upon concatenated sequences for 10 conserved proteins. the first of these clades  consisting of aggregatibacter, pasteurella, actinobacillus succinogenes, mannheimia succiniciproducens, haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus somnus was  also independently supported by 13 uniquely shared csis that are not present in other pasteurellaceae species or other bacteria. another clade consisting of the  remaining pasteurellaceae species (viz. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus minor, haemophilus ducryi, mannheimia haemolytica and haemophilus  parasuis) was also strongly and independently supported by nine csis that are uniquely present in these bacteria. the order pasteurellales is presently made up of a single family, pasteurellaceae, that encompasses all of its genera. in this  context, our identification of two distinct clades within the pasteurellales, which are supported by both phylogenetic analyses and by multiple highly specific molecular markers, strongly argues for and provides potential means for the division of various genera from this order into a minimum of two families. the genetic changes responsible for these csis were likely introduced in the common ancestors of either all pasteurellales or of these two specific clades. these csis provide novel means for the identification and circumscription of these groups of pasteurellales in molecular terms.

TI  == sequence analysis of serotype-specific synthesis regions ii of haemophilus influenzae serotypes c and d: evidence for common ancestry of capsule synthesis in pasteurellaceae and neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == sequencing of yet unknown haemophilus influenzae serotype c (hic) and d (hid) capsule synthesis regions ii revealed four (ccs1-4) and five (dcs1-5) open reading frames, respectively. the inferred gene functions were in line with capsular polysaccharide structures. one or more proteins encoded by the hic capsule synthesis region ii showed similarity to actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  serotype 1 and actinobacillus suis k1 enzymes. orthologues to the complete operon were observed in actinobacillus minor strain 202, where even the gene order was conserved. furthermore, ccs4 was related to the capsule o-acetyltransferase of neisseria meningitidis serogroup w-135. for the hid locus, similarities to hie, mannheimia haemolytica a1 and n. meningitidis serogroup a were identified and the succession of genes was similar in the different species. the resemblance of genes and gene organization found for hic and hid with other species suggested horizontal gene transfer during capsule evolution across the bacterial classes.

TI  == crystal structure and immunogenicity of the class c acid phosphatase from pasteurella multocida.
AB  == pasteurella multocida is a pathogen of veterinary and medical importance. here, we report the 1.85a resolution crystal structure of the class c acid phosphatase  from this organism (denoted rpmccap). the structure shows that rpmccap exhibits the same haloacid dehalogenase fold and dimeric assembly as the class c enzyme from haemophilus influenzae. formation of the dimer in solution is demonstrated using analytical ultracentrifugation. the active site is devoid of a magnesium ion due to the presence of citrate in the crystallization buffer. absence of the  metal ion minimally perturbs the active site structure, which suggests that the main role of the ion is to balance the negative charge of the substrate rather than stabilize the active site structure. the crystal lattice displays unusual crystal packing involving the c-terminal polyhistidine tag mimicking the substrate. steady-state kinetic constants are determined for the substrates nmn,  5'-amp, 3'-amp, 2'-amp, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. the highest catalytic efficiency is observed with nmn. the production of polyclonal anti-rpmccap antibodies is demonstrated, and these antibodies are shown to cross-react with the h. influenzae class c phosphatase. the antibodies are used to detect pmccap in clinical p. multocida and mannheimia haemolytica strains cultured from infected animals.

TI  == new plasmid tools for genetic analysis of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other pasteurellaceae.
AB  == we have generated a set of plasmids, based on the mobilizable shuttle vector pmidg100, which can be used as tools for genetic manipulation of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and other members of the pasteurellaceae. a tandem reporter plasmid, pmc-tandem, carrying promoterless xyle and gfpmut3 genes downstream of a multiple-cloning site (mcs), can be used for identification of transcriptional regulators and conditions which favor gene expression from different cloned promoters. the ability to detect transcriptional regulators using the tandem reporter system was validated in a. pleuropneumoniae using the cloned rpoe (sigma(e)) promoter (p). the resulting plasmid, pmcrpoep, was used to identify a  mutant defective in production of rsea, the negative regulator of sigma(e), among a bank of random transposon mutants, as well as to detect induction of sigma(e) following exposure of a. pleuropneumoniae to ethanol or heat shock. pmcsodcp, carrying the cloned sodc promoter of a. pleuropneumoniae, was functional in a. pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parasuis, mannheimia haemolytica, and pasteurella multocida. two general expression vectors, pmk-express and pmc-express, which differ in their antibiotic resistance markers  (kanamycin and chloramphenicol, respectively), were constructed for the pasteurellaceae. both plasmids have the a. pleuropneumoniae sodc promoter upstream of the gfpmut3 gene and an extended mcs. replacement of gfpmut3 with a gene of interest allows complementation and heterologous gene expression, as evidenced by expression of the haemophilus ducreyi nadv gene in a. pleuropneumoniae, rendering the latter nad independent.

TI  == [fatty acid composition of cells and lipopolysaccliarides of mannheimia haemolytica, mannheimia glucosida and bibersteinia trehalosi strains].
AB  == the mannheimia haemolytica, mannheimia glucosida and bibersteinia trehalosi strains and the similar fatty acid composition of cells with domination of c(16:1) and c(16:0), which were in almost equal quantities, c(14:0 and c(18:1) +  c(18:2). the fatty acid composition of lipopolysaccharides (lps) of the studied bacteria had no essential differences too. it was mainly represented by c(14:0) and 3-oh-c(14:0) which consisted of more than 80% of all lps fatty acids. c(12:0), c(16:1) and c(16:0) were presented in lps in small quantities. the m. haemolytica, m. glucosida and b. trehalosi strains did not differ essentially by  fatty acid compositions of cells and lps from earlier studied strains of genera pasteurella (p. multocida), haemophilus (h. influenzae and other species), actinobacillus (a. pleuropneumoniae). this shows the close phylogenetic relationship of the mentioned bacteria and significance of investigated signs as  chemotaxonomic markers for differentiation of taxons of the above genus level. the paper is presented in russian.

TI  == evolution of competence and dna uptake specificity in the pasteurellaceae.
AB  == background: many bacteria can take up dna, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence and transformation remain obscure. the sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. additional insight may come from the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence (uss) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient dna uptake. we used the distribution of competence genes and dna uptake specificity in h. influenzae's family, the pasteurellaceae, to examine the ancestry of competence. results: a phylogeny of the pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the hin subclade (h. influenzae, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia succiniciproducens, and h. somnus), and the apl subclade (a. pleuropneumoniae, m. haemolytica, and h. ducreyi). all species contained homologues of all known h. influenzae competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. competence gene defects were identified in three  species (h. somnus, h. ducreyi and m. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin. the assumption that uss arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of h. influenzae proteins with distant homologues. abundant uss-like repeats were found in all eight pasteurellacean genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the hin subclade were identical to that of h. influenzae (aagtgcggt), whereas members of the apl subclade shared the consensus  acaagcggt. all species' usss had the strong consensus and flanking at-rich repeats of h. influenzae usss. dna uptake and competition experiments demonstrated that the apl-type repeat is a true uss distinct from the hin-type uss: a. pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up dna fragments containing the apl-type uss over both h. influenzae and unrelated dnas, and h. influenzae prefers its own uss over the apl type. conclusion: competence and dna uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the pasteurellaceae, with divergent usss  and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. the conservation of most competence genes over the approximately 350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence may be evolutionary dead ends.

TI  == induction of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in thp-1 cells by salmonella typhimurium, pasteurella haemolytica and haemophilus influenzae porins.
AB  == the effect of porins purified from salmonella typhimurium, pasteurella haemolytica and haemophilus influenzae on induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in thp-1 cells and c3h/hej macrophage was investigated. incubation of porins at concentration of 1.0-5.0 microg ml(-1) with either thp-1 or macrophage from c3h/hej mice resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific host cell proteins. after porin stimulation a pattern of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins appeared in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, in the membrane fraction and in the insoluble protein fraction. the observed effects were dependent on the porin concentrations; they reached a maximal expression at 3 min and declined at 60 min. porin and lipopolysaccharide treatments induce a similar phosphorylation pattern in all of the three cellular fractions studied. a difference can be observed in the cytoplasmic fraction bands of 50-60 kda, which are more evident after treatment with lipopolysaccharide, and in the insoluble fraction band of 80 kda and the cytoplasmic fraction band of 250 kda, which are more evident after treatment with porins. the events of tyrosine protein phosphorylation were present in macrophage from lipopolysaccaride-hyporesponsive c3h/hej mice stimulated with porins, while they were markedly reduced when the cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. staurosporine, genistein and cytochalasin d induced in the three cellular fractions a different inhibition pattern of tyrosine protein phosphorylation in porin stimulated cells. porins extracted from the three bacterial species investigated behave in a similar way as stimuli more  or less potent; hib porin seems to be the most powerful stimulator and, moreover, it specifically induces phosphorylation of a 55 kda band.

TI  == genetic analysis of virulence factors of mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica a1.
AB  == using a molecular genetic approach, the genes that code for the various virulence factors of mannheimia haemolytica a1 have been cloned for detailed characterizations. these included analysis of the encoded proteins, their biological activities, secretion of the molecules from the bacterium as well as their use in a vaccine component. two newly characterized antigens of m. haemolytica a1 have been identified. the first one is a tonb-dependent iron regulated outer-membrane receptor that is distinct from the transferrin binding proteins. the 84kda irp protein exhibits features including a tonb box and a 50 amino acid region that can adopt occluded beta-barrel structures similar to the "plug" domain of the escherichia coli fhua and fepa crystal structures. homologues of irp were identified by analysis of the genome sequences of a number of gram negative mucosal pathogens, including neisseria meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. the neisserial irp genes were cloned by pcr and expressed the 84kda  protein as expected, demonstrating that they are functional genes. in addition to being regulated by iron and fur, irp(mh) undergoes phase variation by a slipped-strand mispairing mechanism and may represent a contingency locus for iron acquisition during an infection. another locus that codes for a putative adhesin molecule has also been partially characterized. this putative adhesin protein is highly homologous with the high-molecular-weight adhesin proteins of non-piliated non-typable strains of haemophilus influenzae (nthi) including hia,  hsf, hmw1, hmw2. currently, we have cloned the dna that codes for 2223 amino acids (225kda) and is still missing the stop codon. it is anticipated that when complete, the protein could be close to 240kda, similar to the molecular mass of  hsf. though incomplete, analysis of the adhesin showed that it exhibits characteristics of autotransporter (at) proteins. the role of this high-molecular-weight adhesin in infection is being investigated.

TI  == occurrence and structure-function relationship of pentameric short sequence repeats in microbial genomes.
AB  == it is suggested that genomes found in any form of cellular life contain potentially size-variable repetitive dna moieties. in eukaryotes, large proportions of the multi-chromosomal genome consist of various classes of repetitive dna. also in archaeal genomes, repetitive dna is encountered and, as is the case for the eukaryotes as well, little or no function is at present attributable to most of it. for prokaryotes, elegant experiments have highlighted so-called slipped strand nucleotide mispairing (ssm) as a basic and causal mechanism, giving rise to repeat unit number variation at a distinct locus. illegitimate base pairing in regions of repetitive dna during replication, in association with defective dna repair and enhanced nuclease susceptibility of replication intermediates, in the end gives rise to deletion or addition of repeat units. prokaryotic short sequence repeats (ssrs) harbour arrays of short repeat units, between one and approximately 20 nucleotides in length. ssrs are involved in various mechanisms of microbial gene expression regulation. promoter  strength can be affected by altering the spacing between important structural domains as can the integrity of open reading frames. in the present communication the literature on microbial ssrs harbouring repeat units that are five nucleotides in length will be briefly reviewed. examples of these ssrs with discrete functionality are encountered in bacterial species such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pasteurella haemolytica. in addition, several of the currently known bacterial and archaeal whole genome sequences were scanned for the presence of novel examples of potential five-nucleotide ssrs (and others) in order to gather additional knowledge on the propensity and putative functions of this type of potential genetic switch.

TI  == characterization of the pasteurella haemolytica transferrin receptor genes and the recombinant receptor proteins.
AB  == the tbpa and tbpb genes encoding the transferrin receptor proteins, tbpa and tbpb, from pasteurella haemolytica a1 were cloned, sequenced and expressed in escherichia coli. the genes were organized in a putative operon arrangement of tbpb- tbpa. the tbpb gene was preceded by putative promoter and regulatory sequences, and followed by a 96 base pair intergenic sequence in which no promoter regions were found, suggesting that the two genes are coordinately transcribed. the deduced amino acid sequences of the tbpa and tbpb proteins had regions of homology with the corresponding neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae tbp and lbp proteins. the intact tbpb gene was expressed in a t7 expression system and the resulting recombinant tbpb protein retained the functional bovine transferrin binding characteristics. the availability of the recombinant tbpb enabled us to demonstrate its specificity for ruminant transferrins, its ability to bind both the c-and n-terminal lobes of bovine transferrin and its preference for the iron-loaded form of this protein. several attempts at expressing the cloned tbpa  gene were unsuccessful, suggesting that the product of the gene may be toxic to e. coli.

TI  == purification and characterization of a 31-kilodalton iron-regulated periplasmic protein from pasteurella haemolytica a1.
AB  == a prominent iron-regulated periplasmic protein was purified from pasteurella haemolytica grown in an iron-deficient chemically defined medium. the protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography and appeared as a single band by sds-page with a molecular weight of 32,000. a yield of five mg was obtained from  91 mg of protein extract. the iron-regulated protein existed as a monomer in the  native state with an average molecular weight of 29,877 as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation. the protein had a molecular weight of 30,880 as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry, hence the protein is referred to as the 31 kda protein. isoelectric focusing showed four bands with pis of 7.15, 6.8, 6.6, and 5.9. the secondary structure of the protein was determined by circular dichroism and contained 16% alpha-helical structure. the n-terminal sequence, epfkvvttftviqdiaqnvagdkat, showed a 95% identity with the 31 kda iron-binding protein from haemophilus influenzae. isolation and characterization of iron-regulated proteins are of particular interest because of their potential roles in iron assimilation and microbial virulence.

AB  == a recombinant plasmid (pmg1) carrying pasteurella haemolytica a1 dna which complements a tonb mutation of escherichia coli has been isolated. e. coli tonb mete which carries pmg1 exhibits growth kinetics in the presence of vitamin b12 similar to that of the wild-type host. in addition, the complemented e. coli is susceptible to killing by bacteriophage phi 80 and colicin b. analysis of the nucleotide sequence in the complementing dna showed that it codes for three genes in the order of exbb-exbd-tonb. this genetic organization has been reported in haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi, pseudomonas putida and vibrio cholerae, and may represent a separate lineage of evolution from that of the enterobacteriaceae in which tonb is unlinked with the accessory genes exbb and exbd. a comparison of the dna flanking the exbb-exbd-tonb locus in p. haemolytica a1 and h. influenzae  showed that the flanking regions are completely different between the two organisms.

TI  == the restriction-modification system of pasteurella haemolytica is a member of a new family of type i enzymes.
AB  == genes encoding the type i restriction-modification (r-m) system of the bovine pathogen, pasteurella haemolytica, have been identified immediately downstream of a locus that encodes a transcriptional activator of p. haemolytica leukotoxin expression. type i enzymes are encoded by three genes called hsdm, hsds and hsdr, and have fallen into three groups, called ia, ib and ic. hsds provides a sequence recognition function which in concert with hsdm forms an active methyltransferase (mtase). inclusion of the hsdr subunit in the complex creates an active restriction endonuclease (enase) capable of cleaving unmethylated target dna. the p. haemolytica hsdmsr genes were mapped using transposon tn10d-cam insertions, and bacteriophage restriction and modification assays in escherichia coli. we determined the nucleotide sequences of hsdm, hsds and hsdr, and observed that the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were very similar to predicted r-m subunits in  the respiratory pathogen, haemophilus influenzae. phylogenetic comparisons of all known hsd aa sequences placed the p. haemolytica and h. influenzae proteins into  a new group which we labeled the type id r-m family. expression of the p. haemolytica r-m genes in e. coli was inefficient and is likely to be a consequence of the unusual codon usage in p. haemolytica genes.

TI  == occurrence of [copper, zinc]-cofactored superoxide dismutase in pasteurella haemolytica and its serotype distribution.
AB  == fifty-two ovine strains of pasteurella haemolytica and p. trehalosi representing  serotypes 1-16 were examined for the presence of [copper, zinc]superoxide dismutase dna sequences. this was done using a combination of polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers based on the sequence of the [cu,zn]superoxide dismutase gene (sodc) in related species and southern hybridization using a fragment of sodc from p. haemolytica a2 serotype as a probe. both detection methods identified a fragment of the sodc gene in 9/9 strains of p. haemolytica serotype 2 examined and in 5/8 strains of serotype 7. no evidence of this gene was found in any other serotype of p. haemolytica or in any p. trehalosi serotype. comparison of dna sequence showed near identity between sodc from the a2 and a7 serotypes of p. haemolytica and substantial similarity (70%) to sodc previously sequenced in p. multocida, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae. analysis by gel electrophoresis of the superoxide dismutase activity  present in cell lysates showed that one or more superoxide dismutase is present in all serotypes. however, cyanide-inhibitable activity, corresponding to [cu,zn]superoxide dismutase, was detected only in those strains of serotypes a2 and a7 which showed evidence of the sodc gene fragment.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the gale locus of pasteurella haemolytica a1.
AB  == the enzyme udp-galactose 4-epimerase (gale) is involved in one of the major steps of galactose metabolism in bacteria. in many cases, gale is required for the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharide materials such as lipopolysaccharide (lps) and capsule. mutants defective in gale have been shown to exhibit reduced virulence. here we describe the cloning and characterization of the gale gene from the bovine pathogen pasteurella haemolytica a1. this was achieved by the complementation of a salmonella typhimurium gale mutant with a p. haemolytica a1  plasmid bank. analysis of six clones recovered on minimal media with galactose as the carbon source showed that they all contained the same recombinant plasmid with a 5-kbp dna insert. the gale-complementing activity was localized to a 2.2-kbp dna region by subcloning. biochemical, immunological, and phage sensitivity analyses of the recombinant lps in s. typhimurium showed that it is essentially identical to that of the wild type. in vivo expression studies showed that a 37-kda protein is expressed from the complementing plasmids, and the presence of gale activity was confirmed by an assay for epimerase activity. nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned dna identified the gale gene. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence analysis of p. haemolytica a1 gale  with published data showed high-level homology, 81.6%, with the gale of haemophilus influenzae type b. however, the sequences flanking gale do not show similarity with any other gal gene, suggesting that p. haemolytica a1 gale is not linked to the other genes of the gal operon, as is the case for neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae. the separation of gale from the classical gal operon genes was confirmed by southern blot hybridization  studies, and a physical map showing the relative positions of gale, galt, and galk was constructed.

TI  == three contiguous lipoprotein genes in pasteurella haemolytica a1 which are homologous to a lipoprotein gene in haemophilus influenzae type b.
AB  == an escherichia coli clone carrying the recombinant plasmid pph24 has been found to express highly immunoreactive antigens of pasteurella haemolytica a1. two or three antigens of approximately 30 kda were located to both the inner and outer membranes of the e. coli clone and in p. haemolytica a1. from the insert dna of 8.2 kbp on pph24, a fragment of 4.6 kbp was found to code for these antigens. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 4.6-kbp dna identified three genes (designated plpa, -b, and -c) arranged in tandem which code for three proteins, plp1, -2, and -3, with predicted molecular masses of 30.1, 30.3, and 29.0 kda, respectively. comparison of the nucleic acid sequence of plpa, -b, and -c with genbank sequences showed extensive homology with a haemophilus influenzae 28-kda  lipoprotein gene. [14c]palmitate labelling coupled with glybomycin inhibition experiments showed that plp1, -2, and -3 are also lipoproteins. in addition, plpa, -b, and -c were found to be present only in a biotypes of p. haemolytica by southern blot analysis. since plp1, -2, and -3 were found to be antigenic components in a culture supernatant vaccine, they could be candidates for further investigation as vaccine components.

TI  == analysis of tandem, multiple genes encoding 30-kda membrane proteins in pasteurella haemolytica a1.
AB  == a number of outer membrane proteins (omps), including a 30-kda protein, may be important in eliciting immunity to pasteurella haemolytica a1, the causative agent of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. to better understand the nature of the  30-kda antigen, several genes encoding this protein were sequenced. sequence analysis revealed that three separate genes encoding similar, yet distinct, versions of the 30-kda protein are tandemly arranged on the p. haemolytica a1 chromosome. the genes appear to be transcribed from a single promoter. the deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes are similar to a 28-kda inner membrane lipoprotein of escherichia coli and a 28-kda membrane  protein which may contribute to the virulence of haemophilus influenzae type b strains.

TI  == the region of human transferrin involved in binding to bacterial transferrin receptors is localized in the c-lobe.
AB  == iron-saturated human transferrin was digested with either chymotrypsin or trypsin to produce c-lobe and n-lobe protein fragments. individual protein fragments were purified by a combination of gel filtration and concanavalin a affinity chromatographic procedures. the c-lobe and n-lobe fragments of human transferrin  were then used in binding assays to assess their ability in binding to the bacterial transferrin receptors. competitive binding assays demonstrated that the c-lobe fragment of human transferrin binds as well as intact human transferrin to bacterial transferrin receptors from neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae. using isogenic mutants of n. meningitidis deficient in either of the transferrin-binding proteins (tbps), we demonstrated that both transferrin-binding proteins were able to bind to the c-lobe fragment of human transferrin.

TI  == distinct plasmid profiles of pasteurella haemolytica serotypes and the characterization and amplification in escherichia coli of ampicillin-resistance plasmids encoding rob-1 beta-lactamase.
AB  == thirty-five isolates of pasteurella haemolytica from cattle or sheep were screened for the presence of plasmids and for resistance to a range of antibiotics. eight strains (four of serotype a1, three of serotype a2 and one untypable) contained plasmid dna and isolates of the same serotype had similar plasmid profiles, which were different from those of the other serotypes. all but one of the plasmid-bearing strains were isolated from pneumonic animals or from animals in contact with pneumonic cattle or sheep. in a2 and untypable strains, there was no obvious correlation between antibiotic resistance and the presence of a specific plasmid. in contrast, all plasmid-bearing a1 strains exhibited ampicillin resistance (apr), which was shown by transfer studies to be plasmid-mediated. plasmid dna prepared from e. coli transformants was not routinely detected on ethidium-bromide-stained agarose gels, but could be amplified to detectable levels by treatment of cultures with chloramphenicol (cm) or by modifying the growth conditions. the apr plasmids from p. haemolytica were  identical by restriction enzyme analysis. restriction analysis and hybridization  data indicated that these plasmids were closely related to the prototype rob-1 beta-lactamase-encoding plasmid, originally isolated from haemophilus influenzae. from substrate profiles and isoelectric focusing data, the beta-lactamases encoded by the p. haemolytica plasmids were indistinguishable from the rob-1 beta-lactamase.
