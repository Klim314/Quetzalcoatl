TI  == bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect  to both age and tonsillar size. the purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils  in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. a prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. we analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. the most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci and  diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. the most  commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were propionibacterium acnes, prevotella melaninogenica and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. we found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. the study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. this polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.

TI  == comparison of the antibacterial effect of modified 3-mix paste versus ultrapex over anaerobic microorganisms from infected root canals of primary teeth: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of a modified 3-mix paste and to compare it with an iodoform paste (ultrapex) against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from root canals of infected or necrotic primary teeth. study design: an in vitro experimental assay was performed over isolated and identified anaerobic microorganisms of 21 samples, in order to compare the antimicrobial ability of both root canal filling materials,  using a disc-diffusion method. results: a total of 21 microbial samples (15 polymicrobial and 6 monomicrobial) were obtained, from which 19 different strains were identified. modified 3-mix paste showed an excellent antimicrobial effect against most of both kinds of microbial samples, although some of them exhibited  resistance; on the other hand, ultrapex showed only minimal antimicrobial ability (null or low categories). clostridium ramosum exhibited the most resistance to both materials. conclusion: the bactericidal effect of the modified 3-mix paste was superior to ultrapex, with a statistically significant difference, against anaerobic microorganisms isolated from infected root canals of primary teeth.

TI  == activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1dra, temporin-1va and the melittin-related peptides ar-23 and rv-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1dra from rana draytonii and temporin-1va from rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (ar-23 from rana tagoi and rv-23 from r. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. these peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. all peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) </=25 microm) against the gram-positive bacilli propionibacterium acnes and clostridium tertium and the gram-positive cocci peptostreptococcus anaerobius. activity was lower and more variable against clostridium septicum, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. growth of the gram-negative  bacilli bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (mic</=25 microm) against prevotella melaninogenica. the clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1dra and temporin-1va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  == aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). a total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).

TI  == [the bacterial flora of preputial space].
AB  == the bacterial flora of the preputial space of 210 healthy males (43 children aged between 2 and 11 years, 137 males between 12 and 60 years and 30 men over 60 years) was determined by smears and cultueres from glans penis, sulcus coronarius and the adjacent prepuce. the results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. in the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. in the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases. prevalent are gramnegative anaerobes, especially bacterioides melaninogenicus, also enterococci, enterobacteria and coagulase-positive staphylococci.

TI  == abscesses of the frontal lobe of the brain secondary to covert dental sepsis.
AB  == the bacterial species found in pus aspirated from brain abscesses in two patients were typical of those found in dental sepsis. subsequently apical-root abscesses  were demonstrated in the upper jaws of both patients. this evidence strongly suggests that these cerebral abscesses were secondary to dental sepsis which could have spread from the teeth to the frontal lobes by several possible antaomical pathways.
