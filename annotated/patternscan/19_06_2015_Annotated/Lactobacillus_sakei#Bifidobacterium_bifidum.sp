TI  == extracellular antimutagenic activities of selected probiotic bifidobacterium and  lactobacillus spp. as a function of growth phase.
AB  == the capabilities of selected strains from genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium to produce extracellular bioactive compounds with antimutagenic properties against benzo[a]pyrene (bap) and sodium azide (sa) were tested as a function of growth phase. the bacterial supernatants from exponential and stationary phases were characterized with different patterns of antimutagenic activity against the two mutagens. all lactobacilli exhibited either no effect or low antimutagenicity against bap during exponential growth. higher antimutagenic  activities of lactobacilli supernatants were observed in the stationary phase against sa as well. an exception was lactobacillus sakei 23k which expressed a relatively low percent of inhibition of mutagenesis (pi = 28.14 +/- 7.41) in the  exponential phase and no antimutagenic activity in the stationary phase. of the bifidobacteria, only bifidobacterium adoleascentis atcc 15703 exhibited higher antimutagenecity against bap in the exponential phase. the same bacterial supernatants however, did not possess any antimutagenicity against sa in either the exponential or stationary phases. b. bifidum atcc 11863 did not express any significant differences in its activity against either bap or sa in the exponential or stationary phases. only b. breve atcc 15700 expressed a high antimutagenic effect against sa in the stationary phase but exhibited no effect during exponential growth. overall, bacterial antimutagenic responses were associated with growth phase and type of mutagen.
