TI  - Application of quantitative real-time PCR for rapid identification of Bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms in human wound samples.
AB  - Our goal was to establish a quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) method to detect Bacteroides fragilis group and related organisms from clinical specimens. Compared to conventional anaerobic culture, QRT-PCR can provide accurate and more rapid detection and identification of B. fragilis group and similar species. B. fragilis group and related organisms are the most frequently isolated anaerobic pathogens from clinical samples. However, culture and phenotypic identification is quite time-consuming. We designed specific primers and probes based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides eggerthii, B. fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Odoribacter splanchnicus (Bacteroides splanchnicus), Parabacteroides distasonis (Bacteroides distasonis) and Parabacteroides merdae (Bacteroides merdae), and detected these species by means of QRT-PCR in 400 human surgical wound infection samples or closed abscesses. The target bacteria were detected from 31 samples (8%) by culture, but from 132 samples (33%) by QRT-PCR (p-value < 0.001). B. uniformis was the most common species (44 positive samples) according to QRT-PCR while culture showed it to be B. fragilis (16 positive samples). Additionally, for each species QRT-PCR detected higher counts than culture did; this may reflect detecting DNA of dead organisms by QRT-PCR. QRT-PCR is a rapid and sensitive method which has great potential for detection of B. fragilis group and related organisms in wound samples.
TI  - Rapid identification of the species of the Bacteroides fragilis group by multiplex PCR assays using group- and species-specific primers.
AB  - We report a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identify the 10 Bacteroides fragilis group species - Bacteroides caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis and B. vulgatus. These 10 species were first divided into three subgroups by multiplex PCR-G, followed by three multiplex PCR assays with three species-specific primer mixtures for identification to the species level. The primers were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA, the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and part of the 23S rRNA gene. The established two-step multiplex PCR identification scheme was applied to the identification of 155 clinical isolates of the B. fragilis group that were previously identified to the species level by phenotypic tests. The new scheme was more accurate than phenotypic identification, which was accurate only 84.5% of the time. The multiplex PCR scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of the B. fragilis group species. This will permit more accurate assessment of the role of various B. fragilis group members in infections and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of rabbit caecal pectinolytic bacteria.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty colonies from the caecal contents of six rabbits were picked up and, after a 2-d incubation, were microscopically characterized using Gram staining. Large Gram-negative (34%) and small Gram-negative (30%) irregular rods, Gram-negative (27%) and Gram-positive (8%) cocci were found. Eleven isolates (Bacteroides ovatus (6 strains), B. thetaiotamicron, B. caccae, B. stercoris, B. capillosus and Capnocytophaga ochracea) were identified using commercial tests for measuring their catalase activity, metabolite production, etc., and testing their growth in 20% bile. Bacteria belonging to the genus Bacteroides were demonstrated to be the principal pectinolytic organisms in the rabbit caecum.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for the identification of the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a rapid identification system, Rapid ID 32A (bioMerieux), for the identification of clinically important species in the B. fragilis group. METHODS: The use of Rapid ID 32A was validated on 249 clinical isolates, all of which were tested by conventional techniques, and in selected instances API 20A. Rapid ID 32A (and API 20A as appropriate) was then applied in a central laboratory to the identification of 1289 B. fragilis group clinical isolates from 22 laboratories in 15 European countries. RESULTS: Improvements in the initial database permitted the accurate identification of isolates of B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. vulgatus, but further tests, especially for catalase production, were required to distinguish between B. ovatus and B. uniformis, while an identification of B. distasonis could be accepted only after careful review of results. There were too few isolates of B. caccae, B. merdae and B. stercoris for us to reach satisfactory conclusions, but further tests are clearly necessary. CONCLUSIONS: The study emphasizes the importance of including sufficient numbers of isolates of different species in the validation of identification methods. Rapid ID 32A is a reliable system for the identification of the common species in the B. fragilis group, especially B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron.
TI  - Sphingolipid composition in Bacteroides species.
AB  - Sphingolipid profiles of strains from species of genus Bacteroides, and representative strains from Prevotella and Porphyromonas, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and infrared spectrophotometry. Two major types of phosphosphingolipid, ceramide phosphorylethanolamine and ceramide phosphorylglycerol, were detected in B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, B. caccae, B. eggerthii, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. stercoris, but not in B. merdae, B. distasonis, and B. vulgatus. Strains from the genera Prevotella and Porphyromonas also contained these two sphingolipids. These sphingolipid profiles were conserved within the species tested, and may be useful for differentiation and recognition of relationships within the genera Bacteroides, Prevotella and Porphyromonas.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of the species of the genus Bacteroides sensu stricto by capillary gas chromatography of cellular carbohydrates.
AB  - Whole-cell hydrolysates of Bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus Bacteroides Castellani and Chalmers 1919, and the genetical closely related species B. vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. eggerthii, B. distasonis, B. uniformis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. stercoris, B. merdae, and B. caccae were used to determine characteristic carbohydrate patterns by capillary gas chromatography. On the basis of the chemical derivatization of the carbohydrates seven characteristic peaks for peracetylated aldononitriles and nine characteristic peaks for peracetylated o-methyloximes were selected from the carbohydrate fingerprints of the reference strains to prepare a dichotomous identification key. The classification of an unknown strain supposed to belong to the formerly called 'Bacteroides fragilis group' is possible with this key. Some of the advantages of the technique were that the identification of Bacteroides fragilis-like strains requires only 4-5 h after primary isolation and that the bacteria can be exposed to oxygen because viability of the organisms is not necessary. Sophisticated anaerobic techniques can therefore be avoided for identification.
TI  - Prevotella, a new genus to include Bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus Bacteroides.
AB  - It was recently proposed that the genus Bacteroides should be restricted to Bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus). By contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral Bacteroides species, which include B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus Bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. Therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, Prevotella. The type species is Prevotella melaninogenica.
TI  - Rapid and correct identification of intestinal Bacteroides spp. with chromosomal  DNA probes by whole-cell dot blot hybridization.
AB  - A dot blot hybridization procedure with 32P-labeled whole chromosomal DNA of the  type strains as probes was developed as a rapid and simple method for identification of intestinal Bacteroides species. Bacterial cells were fixed onto membrane filters by slight suction, treated with 0.5 N NaOH, and hybridized with these probes. Of 65 Bacteroides strains isolated from 19 human fecal specimens, which were identified as B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, B. caccae, B. uniformis, B. stercoris, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, and B. merdae by conventional phenotypic characterization, 62 (95%) were correctly identified with this hybridization procedure.
