TI  - Dysgonomonas mossii sp. nov., from human sources.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on seven unidentified gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccobacillus-shaped organisms isolated from human clinical specimens. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that four of the strains corresponded to Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides whereas the remaining three isolates represent a new sub-line within the genus Dysgonomonas, displaying greater than 5% sequence divergence with Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides and Dysgonomonas gadei. The three novel isolates were readily distinguished from D.capnocytophagoides and D. gadei by biochemical tests. The DNA base composition of the novel species was consistent with its assignment to the genus Dysgonomonas. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence it is proposed that the unknown species, be classified as Dysgonomonas mossii sp. nov. The type strain of Dysgonomonas mossii is CCUG 43457T (= CIP 107079T).
