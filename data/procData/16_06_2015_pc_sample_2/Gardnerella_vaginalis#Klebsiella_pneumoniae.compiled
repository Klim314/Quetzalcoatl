TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Aerobic microbiological study in term pregnant women with premature rupture of the membranes: a case-control study.
AB  - To determine the aerobic microorganisms related to premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) in term pregnant women, a case-controlled study was performed on pregnant women delivered at Rajavithi Hospital between November 1, 1996 and July 30, 1997. Two hundred and twenty pregnant women with PROM and 220 pregnant women without PROM were recruited by simple random sampling. The diagnosis of rupture of the membrane was made by history and by positive microscopic ferning and pH testing performed during speculum examination. The demographic characteristics were not statistically significantly different between both groups. We could not isolate any organisms (35.9% in the study group and 49.5% in the control group). Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the only two significant differences demonstrated between the study and control group (p<0.05). Candida albicans, the most prevalent organism in the study group, demonstrated significant difference between the study and control group (14.5% and 7.7% respectively) (p<0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated significant difference between the study and control group (7.30% and 4.10% respectively) (p<0.05). Gardnerella vaginalis, the most prevalent organism in the control group, showed no significant difference between the control and study group (16.40% and 14.10% respectively) (p=0.547).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - Trospectomycin (TSP; U-63366F) is a novel spectinomycin (SP) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in vitro activity of the analogue was compared to that of SP against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. The in vivo activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative facultative bacteria. The preliminary human pharmacokinetics of TSP were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. TSP was more active in vitro than SP (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus spp., Bacteroides spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Chlamydia trachomatis. The activity of TSP for most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of SP. TSP was more active than SP (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental infections due to streptococci, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. TSP was well-absorbed following both i.v. and i.m. administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: Cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; Tmax = 25, 75 min; and AUC = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. Pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive HPLC assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). TSP inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
