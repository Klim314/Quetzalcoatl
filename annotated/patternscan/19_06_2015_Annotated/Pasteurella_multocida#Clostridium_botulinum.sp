TI  == pharmacological evidence for activation of phospholipid and small gtp binding protein signalling cascades by nod factors.
AB  == the effects of lipo-chitin oligosaccharide nod factors (nodngr[s] from rhizobium  sp. ngr234) on root hair deformation in vigna unguiculata (l.) walp. were studied using pharmacological agents to mimic and/or inhibit their action. it was hypothesised that the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton seen during nod factor induced root hair deformation is modulated by protein kinase c, monomeric g proteins of the rho superfamily and the location and amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates (pi3ps). this hypothesis is supported by the following observations. the protein kinase c activators, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-acetate (dpa) and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1, stimulated root hair deformation to a level similar to that seen with nod factors or mastoparan, whereas the inhibitor go 6976 inhibited root hair deformations induced by nodngr[s], mastoparan, dpa and diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor 1. the ras antagonists mevastatin and sulindac sulphide, and the rho antagonist exoenzyme c3 toxin from clostridium botulinum all inhibited nod factor stimulated root hair deformation. pasteurella multocida toxin activates rho and stimulated root hair deformation, this stimulation was inhibited by both neomycin and exoenzyme c3 toxin. the pi3 kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and ly-294002 attenuated nod factor  induced root hair deformation. these studies were complemented with actin immunoprecipitations of root hair enriched microsomal membrane preparations from  v. unguiculata which pulled down small gtp binding proteins. root hair deformation is an important early stage in the formation of nitrogen fixing nodules and this study highlights that these processes may depend on signalling cascades involving phospholipids and small gtp binding proteins.

TI  == regulation of osteoblast differentiation by pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt): a  role for rho gtpase in bone formation.
AB  == the role of the rho-rho kinase signaling pathway on osteoblast differentiation was investigated using primary mouse calvarial cells. the bacterial toxin pmt inhibited, whereas rho-rok inhibitors stimulated, osteoblast differentiation and  bone nodule formation. these effects correlated with altered bmp-2 and -4 expression. these data show the importance of rho-rok signaling in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. introduction: the signal transduction pathways controlling osteoblast differentiation are not well understood. in this  study, we used pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt), a unique bacterial toxin that activates the small gtpase rho, and specific rho inhibitors to investigate the role of rho in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro. materials  and methods: primary mouse calvarial osteoblast cultures were used to investigate the effects of recombinant pmt and rho-rho kinase (rok) inhibitors on osteoblast  differentiation and bone nodule formation. osteoblast gene expression was analyzed using northern blot and rt-pcr, and actin rearrangements were visualized after phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy. results: pmt stimulated the proliferation of primary mouse calvarial cells and markedly inhibited the differentiation of osteoblast precursors to bone nodules with a concomitant inhibition of osteoblastic marker gene expression. there was no apparent causal relationship between the stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of differentiation. pmt caused cytoskeletal rearrangements because of activation of  rho, and the inhibition of bone nodules was completely reversed by the rho inhibitor c3 transferase and partly reversed by inhibitors of the rho effector, rok. interestingly, rho and rok inhibitors alone potently stimulated osteoblast differentiation, gene expression, and bone nodule formation. finally, pmt inhibited, whereas rok inhibitors stimulated, bone morphogenetic protein (bmp)-2  and -4 mrna expression, providing a possible mechanism for their effects on bone  nodule formation. conclusions: these results show that pmt inhibits osteoblast differentiation through a mechanism involving the rho-rok pathway and that this pathway is an important negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. conversely, rok inhibitors stimulate osteoblast differentiation and may be potentially useful as anabolic agents for bone.

TI  == pasteurella multocida toxin increases endothelial permeability via rho kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase.
AB  == pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) has been shown to induce actin reorganization through activation of the gtpase rho. here we investigated the involvement of the rho target proteins rho kinase and myosin light chain (mlc) phosphatase in the pmt-induced increase in endothelial permeability and the underlying actin reorganization of endothelial cells. stimulation of endothelial layers with pmt enhanced transendothelial permeability > 10-fold, and this was abolished by pretreatment with the specific rho inactivator c3 transferase from clostridium botulinum. the pmt-induced increase in endothelial permeability was associated with 1) inactivation of mlc phosphatase, 2) an increase in mlc phosphorylation, and 3) endothelial cell retraction and actin stress fiber formation. pmt-stimulated actin reorganization could be prevented by 1) pretreatment of cells with c3 transferase, 2) microinjection of the rho binding domain and the pleckstrin homology domain of rho kinase, and 3) microinjection of constitutively active mlc phosphatase. together, these results suggest that pmt activates rho/rho kinase, which inactivates mlc phosphatase. the resulting increase in mlc  phosphorylation causes endothelial cell retraction and a rise in endothelial permeability.

TI  == pasteurella multocida toxin, a potent intracellularly acting mitogen, induces p125fak and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, actin stress fiber formation, and  focal contact assembly in swiss 3t3 cells.
AB  == treatment of swiss 3t3 cells with recombinant pasteurella multocida toxin (rpmt), a potent intracellularly acting mitogen, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates including bands of m(r) 110,000-130,000 and m(r) 70,000-80,000. tyrosine phosphorylation induced by rpmt occurred after a pronounced lag period (1 h) and was blocked by either lysosomotrophic agents or incubation at 22 degrees c. focal adhesion kinase (p125fak) and paxillin are prominent substrates for rpmt-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. tyrosine phosphorylation by rpmt could be dissociated from both protein kinase c activation and the mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. rpmt stimulated striking actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in swiss 3t3 cells. cytochalasin d, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, completely inhibited rpmt-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. in addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin in response to rpmt was completely abolished when cells were subsequently treated with platelet-derived growth factor at a concentration (30 ng/ml) that disrupted the actin cytoskeleton. our results demonstrate for the first time that rpmt, a bacterial toxin, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak and paxillin and promotes actin stress fiber  formation and focal adhesion assembly in swiss 3t3 cells.
