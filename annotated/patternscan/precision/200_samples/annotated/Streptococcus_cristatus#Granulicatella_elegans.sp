TI == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n = 39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
