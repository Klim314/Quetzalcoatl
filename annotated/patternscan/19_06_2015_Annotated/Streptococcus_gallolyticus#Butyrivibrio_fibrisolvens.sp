TI  == use of community genome arrays (cgas) to assess the effects of acacia angustissima on rumen ecology.
AB  == this research developed a community genome array (cga) to assess the effects of acacia angustissima on rumen microbiology. a. angustissima produces non-protein amino acids as well as tannins, which may be toxic to animals, and cga was used to assess the effects of this plant on the ecology of the rumen. cgas were developed using a 7.5 cmx2.5 cm nylon membrane format that included up to 96 bacterial genomes. it was possible to separately hybridize large numbers of membranes at once using this mini-membrane format. pair-wise cross-hybridization  experiments were conducted to determine the degree of cross-hybridization between strains; cross-hybridization occurred between strains of the same species, but little cross-reactivity was observed among different species. cgas were successfully used to survey the microbial communities of animals consuming an a.  angustissima containing diet but quantification was not precise. to properly quantify and validate the cga, fibrobacter and ruminococcus populations were independently assessed using 16s rdna probes to extracted rrna. the cga detected  an increase in these populations as acacia increased in the diet, which was confirmed by rrna analysis. there was a great deal of variation among strains of  the same species in how they responded to a. angustissima. however, in general selenomonas strains tended to be resistant to the tannins in the acacia while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was sensitive. on the other hand some species, like streptococci, varied. streptococcus bovis-like strains were sensitive to an increase in acacia in the diet while streptococcus gallolyticus-like strains were resistant. strep. gallolyticus has independently been shown to be resistant to tannins. it is concluded that there is significant variation in tannin resistance between strains of the same species. this implies that there are specific molecular mechanisms at play that are independent of the phylogenetic position of the organism.

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.
