TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.
TI  - Microbiological etiology of bacterial prostatitis in general hospital and primary care clinic in Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health classification of prostatitis reported the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially category II, at 3% to 10%. Because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis technique, chronic prostatitis syndrome (CPS) with a known bacterial origin has increased recently. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of chronic bacterial prostatitis in a general hospital and a primary care clinic (PCC) in addition to the distribution of the microorganism in chronic bacterial prostatitis in Korea. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-three patients were enrolled in this study. One hundred and five patients in the general hospital and 188 patients in the PCC were enrolled in the study. Using a questionnaire, all patients were checked for symptoms of urinalysis, expressed prostate secretion (EPS), EPS or V3 culture and PCR of EPS or VB3 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genetalia, and Trichomatis vaginalis. RESULTS: In routine EPS or VB3 culture, 12 of 105 patients (11.4%) in the general hospital showed positive culture, but 77 of 188 patients (40.9%) in the PCC showed a positive culture. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas were isolated in routine culture. In the PCR diagnosis, 37 of 105 patients (35.2%) in the general hospital were PCR positive, and 65 of 188 patients (34.5%) in the PCC were PCR positive. In the general hospital, C. trachomatis was the most common (49%), followed by U. urealyticum (24%), M. genetalia (16%), M. hominis (10%), and T. vaginalis (2%). In the PCC, U. urealyticum was the most common (45%), followed by C. trachomatis (34%), M. hominis (13%), M. genetalia (7%) and T. vaginalis (1%). The proportions of chronic bacterial prostatitis were 46.6% (49/105) and 67.5% (127/188) in the general hospital and PCC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The total portion of chronic bacterial prostatitis was 59.3% (174/293). Culture-positive patients in the PCC were significantly higher than in the general hospital, but the number of PCR positive patients in the PCC was the same as in the general hospital.
TI  - Pathogen profile in men with inflammation of paraurethral glands.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogen profile in men with inflammation of the paraurethral glands. METHODS: We enrolled 40 patients with first-onset, drug-naive inflammation of the paraurethral glands. Discharge from the lesions was collected for Gram staining. Microscopy was performed for screening for trichomonads and detecting Gram-negative intracellular diplococci within phagocytes. Cultures for detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Ureaplasma urealyticum and other bacteria, and Chlamydia-trachomatis-associated antigens were performed. PCR was conducted for herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. RESULTS: From these 40 patients, there were nine microbial species, which included Gram-negative bacteria (23 cases, 54.8%), Gram-positive bacteria (15 cases, 35.7%) and other pathogens (4 cases, 9.5%). The top three pathogens were gonococci (38.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.7%) and Escherichia coli (14.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation of paraurethral glands in men may be caused by a variety of pathogens and not just by gonococcal infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of abnormal vaginal discharges microorganisms in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of bacterial strains and fungal strains infecting the vaginal tract and test their sensitivity to antibiotics in women attending Saint Camille Medical Centre in Ouagadougou. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2009, a total of 2 000 vaginal swabs were cultivated for bacterial and fungal identification and isolation. Furthermore, bacterial strains were tested for their susceptibility to several antibiotics used in routine in the centre. RESULTS: The results revealed that microbial isolation and identification was attempted for 1 536/2 000 sample, a positivity rate of 76.80%. Candida albicans (48.76%), followed by Escherichia coli (16.67%), Streptococcus agalactiae (8.14%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.55%) were the major agents of genital tract infections in patients. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum combined accounted for less than 7%. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.04% cases. The antimicrobial tests revealed that the microorganisms developed resistance to several antibiotics including beta lactams. However, antibiotics such as cefamenzol, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were still active on these bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that many sexually active women are infected by one or more microbial pathogens, probably because of the lack of hygiene or the adoption of some risky behaviors, such as not using condoms or having multiple sexual partners. Efforts should be made to address these points in the country.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.
TI  - Modified real-time PCR for detecting, differentiating, and quantifying Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum.
AB  - We evaluated a previously described quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for quantifying and differentiating Ureaplasma parvum and U. urealyticum. Because of nonspecific reactions with Staphylococcus aureus DNA in the U. parvum PCR, we developed a modified qPCR and designed new primers. These oligonucleotides eradicated cross-reactions, indicating higher specificity. The detection limits of the qPCR were determined at 1 and 3 colony-forming units/ml for U. parvum and U. urealyticum, respectively. The quantification limits of the assay for both Ureaplasma species ranged from 2.10(6) to 2.10(1) copy numbers per PCR. A total of 300 patient samples obtained from the lower genital tract were tested with this newly designed qPCR assay and compared with culture results. Of the samples, 132 (44.0%) were culture positive, whereas 151 (50.3%) tested positive using qPCR. The U. parvum and U. urealyticum species were present in 79.5% and 12.6% of the qPCR-positive samples, respectively. Both species were found in 7.9% of those samples. Quantification of U. parvum and U. urealyticum in the samples ranged from less than 2.5 x 10(3) to 7.4 x 10(7) copies per specimen. In conclusion, the modified qPCR is a suitable method for rapid detection, differentiation, and quantification of U. parvum and U. urealyticum.
TI  - A novel diagnostic tool for detecting neonatal infections using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In newborns with infections, it is necessary to detect various pathogens rapidly and accurately, because the infections are often fatal when diagnosis is delayed. However, no diagnostic tools that rapidly detect pathogens causing neonatal infectious diseases are available. OBJECTIVES: To establish a rapid diagnostic tool using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect 8 major pathogens that often cause neonatal infections, including Group B Streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, herpes simplex virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Candida albicans, and to validate this tool in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHODS: One hundred and thirty clinical samples were obtained from newborns with any infectious signs or histories. DNA was extracted from these samples and multiplex PCR was performed with a mixture of 8 primer pairs, all designed to amplify pathogenic DNA and produce different sizes of amplicons. Seventy-seven samples with suspicion of bacterial infections were also examined by bacterial culture to evaluate the accuracy of the multiplex PCR results. RESULTS: Six of the 8 pathogens could be rapidly detected by our multiplex PCR method, within 3.5-4.5 h. These positive results led us to immediately diagnose and select proper drugs against each pathogen. In comparison with culture results, our test characteristics were as follows: specificity: 93%, negative predictive value: 96%, and concordance rate: 90%. CONCLUSIONS: We have established and validated a rapid diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens using multiplex PCR, which may be useful for the confirmed diagnosis of neonatal infections in the NICU.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen quality.
AB  - We have analyzed two infertile male cohorts with (n=39) and without genital tract infection (n=14) comparing their selected seminological parameters with healthy controls (n=30). Genital tract infection (GTI) has been defined by the presence of leukocytes and pathological bacterial strains identified with Bio-Merieux tests. We have found statistically significant deteriorated semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, morphology and vitality in ejaculated samples of patients with genital tract infection in comparison to healthy controls. Statistically significant negative influence towards sperm reproductive potential has been revealed in case of Escherichia coli, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of three beta-defensins from canine testes.
AB  - Mammalian beta-defensins are small cationic peptides possessing broad antimicrobial and physiological activities. Because dogs are particularly resilient to sexually transmitted diseases, it has been proposed that their antimicrobial peptide repertoire might provide insight into novel antimicrobial therapeutics and treatment regimens. To investigate this proposal, we cloned the full-length cDNA of three canine beta-defensin isoforms (cBD-1, -2, and -3) from canine testicular tissues. Their predicted peptides share identical N-terminal 65-amino-acid residues, including the beta-defensin consensus six-cysteine motif. The two longer isoforms, cBD-2 and -3, possess 4 and 34 additional amino acids, respectively, at the C terminus. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cBD, a 34-amino-acid peptide derived from the shared mature peptide region was synthesized. Canine beta-defensin displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs of 6 and 100 mug/ml, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MICs of 20 to 50, 20, and 50 mug/ml, respectively), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC of 5 to 50 mug/ml) and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. canigenitalium (MIC of 200 mug/ml). Antimicrobial potency was significantly reduced at salt concentrations higher than 140 mM. All three canine beta-defensins were highly expressed in testis. In situ hybridization indicated that cBD-1 was expressed primarily in Sertoli cells within the seminiferous tubules. In contrast, cBD-2 was located primarily within Leydig cells. The longest isoform, cBD-3, was detected in Sertoli cells and to a lesser extent in the interstitium. The tissue-specific expression and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that canine beta-defensins play an important role in host defense and other physiological functions of the male reproductive system.
TI  - DNA methylation and Mycoplasma genomes.
AB  - DNA methylation is one of the many hypotheses proposed to explain the observed deficiency in CpG dinucleotides in a variety of genomes covering a wide taxonomic distribution. Recent studies challenged the methylation hypothesis on empirical grounds. First, it cannot explain why the Mycoplasma genitalium genome exhibits strong CpG deficiency without DNA methylation. Second, it cannot explain the great variation in CpG deficiency between M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae that also does not have CpG-specific methyltransferase genes. I analyzed the genomic sequences of these Mycoplasma species together with the recently sequenced genomes of M. pulmonis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Staphylococcus aureus, and found the results fully compatible with the methylation hypothesis. In particular, I present compelling empirical evidence to support the following scenario. The common ancestor of the three Mycoplasma species has CpG-specific methyltransferases, and has evolved strong CpG deficiency as a result of the specific DNA methylation. Subsequently, this ancestral genome diverged into M. pulmonis and the common ancestor of M. pneumoniae and M. genitalium. M. pulmonis has retained methyltransferases and exhibits the strongest CpG deficiency. The common ancestor lost the methyltransferase gene and then diverged into M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae. M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae, after losing methylation activities, began to regain CpG dinucleotides through random mutation. M. genitalium evolved more slowly than M. pneumoniae, gained relatively fewer CpG dinucleotides, and is more CpG-deficient.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - [Study on etiology of nongonococcal urethritis].
AB  - One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven samples from urogenital tract were detected by isolating culture and immunofluorescence. The positive rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Ureaplasma Urealyticum (UU), Mycoplasma hominis (Mh), Candida (Cd), Staphylococcus aureus were 27.8%, 33.5%, 25.6%, 11.5%, 23% respectively. The rate of mixed infection caused by at least two pathogens was 19.8%. About 90% of the infected patients were from 20 to 40 years old. The related factors of pathogen detection were also studied.
TI  - rho is not essential for viability or virulence in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We have identified the gene for transcription termination factor Rho in Staphylococcus aureus. Deletion of rho in S. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. We also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of Rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. Exceptions include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, all of which appear not to possess a Rho homolog. Complementation studies indicate that S. aureus Rho possesses the same activity as Escherichia coli Rho and that the Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against S. aureus Rho. Our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Microbial flora of women with chronic cervicitis.
AB  - The present study comprised 50 patients of chronic cervicitis attending gynaecological clinic of Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. The aim of the study was to isolate some of the common sexually transmitted disease (STD) pathogens in chronic cervicitis. Cervical swabs were taken from the patients. The swabs were analysed by various microbiological techniques. Most (78%) of the patients harboured infection, no growth of any organism was found in 22% cases. Ureaplasma urealyticum was the predominant organism isolated in 56% of cases. It was isolated singly in 38% of cases. Various other organisms isolated singly were Chlamydia trachomatis in 2% of cases, candida species in 2% of cases, Staphylococcus epidemidis in 4% of cases, lactobacillus in 4% of cases, and Staphylococcus aureus in 2% of cases. Multiple organisms were isolated in 26% of cases.
TI  - Ofloxacin. A reappraisal of its use in the management of genitourinary tract infections.
AB  - Ofloxacin is an established fluoroquinolone agent which achieves good concentrations in genitourinary tract tissues and fluids. It has good in vitro activity against most Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Haemophilus ducreyi, intermediate activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum and most enterococci, but limited or no in vitro activity against enterococci, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many anaerobes. However, high concentrations achieved in the urine ensure its activity against most urinary tract pathogens. Ofloxacin demonstrates consistent efficacy in a broad range of urinary tract infections, achieving bacteriological response rates in excess of 80% in uncomplicated and 70% in complicated infections. The efficacy of ofloxacin was similar to that of all comparators tested including other fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Ofloxacin is also effective as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea, as a 7-day regimen in uncomplicated C. trachomatis infections, and as monotherapy in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Again, ofloxacin demonstrated similar efficacy to alternative treatments in each type of infection. The availability of an intravenous formulation and near-complete oral bioavailability allow ofloxacin to be administered as a sequential regimen without loss of activity. The tolerability and drug interaction profile of ofloxacin is consistent with that of other fluoroquinolones. The most commonly reported adverse events with ofloxacin are gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological. It was associated with a lower incidence of photosensitivity and tendinitis and higher incidence of some neurological events than some other fluoroquinolones. Ofloxacin seems to have a lower propensity to interact with xanthines than other fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: ofloxacin has established efficacy in the treatment of a wide variety of urinary tract infections, although, like other fluoroquinolones, it should be used rationally to preserve its activity. Currently, ofloxacin also holds an important place among fluoroquinolones in the treatment of C. trachomatis infections and uncomplicated PID, although its acceptance as monotherapy in PID is likely to depend on clarification of the causative role of anaerobic pathogens in this infection.
TI  - In-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - Trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) was very active against Gram-negative species examined  including Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp., Neisseria spp. and Escherichia coli (MIC90s < or = 0.03 mg/L). In general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative species. Trovafloxacin was active against Gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s < or = 0.25 mg/L). Against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In addition, Chlamydia spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important Gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - A review of the in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against intracellular pathogens and mycoplasmas.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin displays in-vitro bacteriostatic activity against all Legionella spp. (MICs = 0.06-2 mg/L), with Legionella pneumophila usually being at least two-fold more sensitive to quinupristin/dalfopristin than Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffii, Legionella gormanii and Legionella micdadei (MIC = 0.06-2 vs 1-2 mg/L, respectively). Against Legionella spp., quinupristin/dalfopristin was at least as active as erythromycin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active in vitro against all Mycoplasma spp. tested (MIC = 0.05-2 mg/L), with Mycoplasma hominis being less susceptible than other species. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against erythromycin-resistant strains of Mycoplasma fermentans and M. hominis (MIC90 = 0.5 and 2 mg/L, respectively), and doxycycline-resistant strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC90 = 1 mg/L). The in-vitro bacteriostatic activity against Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium (MIC90 = 0.1 and 0.05 mg/L, respectively) was similar to that of erythromycin and doxycycline. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was actively taken up by murine macrophages, and incubation of the drug (2.5 mg/L) with macrophages containing ingested Staphylococcus aureus resulted in the death of 70% of intracellular bacteria within 120 min. Intracellular concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin reached 50 and 30 times the extracellular concentration, respectively, showing that these compounds readily penetrate into cells. The intracellular activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin may make it suitable for use in some, presently difficult-to-treat, infections caused by intracellular organisms.
TI  - The effect of positive semen bacterial and Ureaplasma cultures on in-vitro fertilization success.
AB  - A total of 342 couples planning to undergo in-vitro fertilization (IVF) were examined for the presence of bacteria in semen prior to and during the procedure. Pregnancy rates were analysed retrospectively to ascertain any adverse affects if > 10000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml bacteria were detected in the semen sample. The most common bacteria isolated from semen were Enterococcus spp. (73%). The presence of these bacteria did not affect the pregnancy rate of the patients with positive cultures prior to (32%) or during (37%) the IVF procedure compared with those patients in whom no bacteria were detected (32%). Those patients with semen cultures positive for Escherichia coli prior to the IVF procedure, but which cleared after treatment had a higher pregnancy rate (60%) compared with those patients who were positive for E.coli at the time of the attempt. The group of patients with Staphylococcus aureus in the semen at the time of IVF also demonstrated a low pregnancy rate (17%). Of the patients. 36 (11%) had positive Ureaplasma cultures from the screening test carried out on the semen and 22% became pregnant after successful treatment. None of the three patients with persistently positive cultures became pregnant. In conclusion, the presence of Enterococcus in semen does not affect pregnancy rates following IVF. E.coli, S.aureus and Ureaplasma urealyticum may have a negative effect and should be treated.
TI  - The tetracycline resistance gene tet(M) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  - Tetracycline resistance genes of the M class, tet(M), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. By comparing the sequences of eight different tet(M) genes (from Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. The two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and a different G/C content. The block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(M) locus. Unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(M) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(M) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - [Azithromycin: critical points].
AB  - The determination of the French breakpoints (< or = c, > C) were selected by the  use of different criteria including bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and obviously clinical criteria. Concerning the bacteriological results, azithromycin, being an acid stable orally administered antimicrobial drug, is in vitro marginally less active than erythromycin against Gram-positive organisms including beta-haemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. But in contrast, this azalide is more active than erytromycin against many Gram-negative pathogens, notably Neisseria gonorrhoeae, H. influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Borrelia burgdorferi. The activity of azithromycin is unaffected by the inoculum, unlike of pH, serum, and presence of CO2 for anaerobes. However, erythromycin-resistant micro-organisms are also resistant to azithromycin. Considering the pharmacokinetic criteria and the clinical results such as infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts, skin and soft tissues, uncomplicated urethritis/cervicitis associated with N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis or U. urealyticum, the preliminary breakpoints of azithromycin are defined by the following concentrations (< or = 0.12 and > 4 mg/l). Additional experimental and clinical results are required to confirm the in vitro activity against some other bacterial species (E. faecalis, L. monocytogenes, Brucella, P. multocida, or even Salmonella and Shigella).
TI  - In-vitro antimycoplasmal activity of flurithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of flurithromycin, a 14-membered macrolide drug, was found  to be similar to that of erythromycin against 41 strains of Mycoplasma spp. and 100 strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum. All 28 strains of Mycoplasma hominis were uniformly resistant to both macrolides with MICs > 256 mg/L, U. urealyticum showed intermediate resistance with MIC50s of 0.5 and 1 mg/L for erythromycin and flurithromycin, respectively, whereas the ten strains of Mycoplasma pneumonia were susceptible to < or = 0.03 mg/L of both macrolides.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. Spanish Collaborative Group.
AB  - The activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. Clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups C, G and F, Brucella melitensis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against Ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against Campylobacter spp. In general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. Cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. Clarithromycin was bactericidal against Streptococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibilities and therapeutic options for Ureaplasma urealyticum infections in neonates.
AB  - The appreciation of Ureaplasma urealyticum as a human pathogen and documentation  of antibiotic resistance have heightened interest in drug susceptibilities and treatment alternatives for patients infected with this organism. Neonates pose special problems when therapy must be considered because of potential toxicities, clinical unfamiliarity or lack of experience. Forty-three isolates of U. urealyticum obtained from the lower respiratory tracts of neonates were tested against chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, doxycycline, and gentamicin by a microbroth dilution technique in 10B broth. In vitro resistance was observed in 1 or more strains for each of the drugs tested, except for erythromycin (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, 0.125 to 4 micrograms/ml, MIC90 = 2 micrograms/ml). MIC90 values for the remaining five antibiotics were: doxycycline, 2 micrograms/ml; chloramphenicol, 8 micrograms/ml; ciprofloxacin, 8 micrograms/ml; clindamycin, 16 micrograms/ml; and gentamicin, 32 micrograms/ml. The effect of pH and/or media components on MICs was evaluated by comparing MICs of American Type Culture Collection reference strain Staphylococcus aureus 29213 obtained in Mueller-Hinton broth (pH 7.2 to 7.4) and 10B broth (pH 6.0). No appreciable effect was detected for ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol or doxycycline, whereas gentamicin, erythromycin and clindamycin all had MICs elevated by one to several dilutions when tested in 10B broth. In some instances the difference was sufficient to alter the interpretation of the MIC. Clinical experience in treating neonatal ureaplasmal infections is reviewed along with recommendations for obtaining cultures, initiating and monitoring efficacy of therapy.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum to sparfloxacin and PD 127391.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two investigational quinolones, sparfloxacin (previously designated AT 4140) and PD 127391, were determined for 30 strains each of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin. Erythromycin was the most active compound against M. pneumoniae (maximum MIC, less than 0.008 microgram/ml). PD 127391 (MICs, less than 0.008 to 0.031 microgram/ml), sparfloxacin (MICs, less than 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml), clindamycin (MICs, less than 0.008 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and tetracycline (MICs, 0.063 to 0.25 microgram/ml) were superior to ciprofloxacin (MICs, 0.5 to 2 microgram/ml). Sparfloxacin and PD 127391 were active against M. hominis (MICs, less than 0.008 to 0.031 microgram/ml for each) at concentrations comparable to those of clindamycin (MICs, less than 0.008 to 0.063 microgram/ml) and at concentrations lower than those of ciprofloxacin (MICs, 0.125 to 0.5 microgram/ml). As expected, M. hominis was resistant to erythromycin (MICs, 32 to greater than or equal to 256 micrograms/ml). For U. urealyticum, PD 127391 (MICs, 0.031 to 0.5 microgram/ml) and sparfloxacin (MICs, 0.063 to 1 microgram/ml) were superior to erythromycin (MICs, 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), ciprofloxacin (MICs, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml), and clindamycin (MICs, 0.25 to 64 micrograms/ml. Both new quinolones were equally active against tetracycline-susceptible as well as resistant strains of M. hominis and U. urealyticum. The possible influence of medium components and/or pH on MICs was evaluated by testing a Staphylococcus aureus reference strain with each antibiotic in SP-4 broth and 10-B broth and comparing the results with published MICs for this strain. MICs determined in 10-B broth for erythromycin were affected most. This study shows that the activities of sparfloxacin and PD 127391 are similar to one another and comparable or superior to those of other drugs used to treat mycoplasmal infections. The MICs of both new quinolones were consistently 2 to several dilutions lower than those of ciprofloxacin for each species.
TI  - Evidence that mycoplasmas, gram-negative bacteria, and certain gram-positive bacteria share a similar protein antigen.
AB  - It was demonstrated that mycoplasmas, gram-negative bacteria, and certain gram-positive bacteria share a similar protein antigen with a molecular weight ranging from 42,000 to 48,000. Western blotting (immunoblotting) with an antibody specific to a 43-kDa membrane protein of Mycoplasma fermentans showed the existence of this protein antigen in all Mycoplasma spp. tested (14 species), Acholeplasma laidlawii (1 strain), and gram-negative bacteria (8 species) but only in Staphylococcus aureus of four gram-positive species tested. Neither Ureaplasma urealyticum nor mammalian cell cultures showed any cross-reactions with this antibody. These proteins were found in both cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of mycoplasma cells but were not exposed on the surface of mycoplasmal or bacterial cells.
TI  - Microbiological study of urethritis in men attending a STD clinic.
AB  - A microbiological study of 275 male patients suffering from urethritis and 100 healthy male controls showed that Neisseria gonorrhoeae (130), Ureaplasma urealyticum (81), Staphylococcus aureus (38), and alpha and beta streptococci (34) were the common isolates. Specificity and sensitivity of the direct fluorescent antibody technique in the detection of N. gonorrhoeae in 130 urethral samples, were found to be 100 per cent. Penicillin (10 units/disc) resistance was found in 36.93 per cent of N. gonorrhoeae. Minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin for 75 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae (including 5 beta lactamase producers) varied from 0.01-5 micrograms/ml with a 95 per cent confidence limit range of 0.26-0.61 microgram/ml. Most of the N. gonorrhoeae isolates tested were sensitive to norfloxacin and spectinomycin. Inclusion bodies of Chlamydia trachomatis were observed in 25 patients.
TI  - Endometrial cultures obtained by a triple-lumen method from afebrile and febrile  postpartum women.
AB  - Transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained Ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. A protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. Compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (P less than .001). Among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group B Streptococcus, enterococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery from the endometrium. Protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.
TI  - Microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, lactobacillus, Mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. Sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (SD = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (SD = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (P = 0.001). Sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal G. vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma species, and U. urealyticum, as well as endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea, and T. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. Significant differences in isolation rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis. In general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; N. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. Differences were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific vaginitis. Vaginal G. vaginalis and Mycoplasma species and endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. It is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.
TI  - Effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - All of the 14 serotype standard strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. A 1 mM concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. The presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. Inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. This differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. For the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. For the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. Serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified. The effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. The concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. Wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and Mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. Laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus Mycoplasma (M. hominis, M. fermentans, and M. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mM manganese. The latter concentration inhibited the growth of Acholeplasma laidlawii and Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mM manganese had no effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis in the male. Apropos of 100 cases treated with doxycycline polyphosphate].
AB  - After pointing out the epidemiological significance of sexually transmitted diseases, the authors report results in 100 male patients given doxycycline polyphosphate during 2 weeks for urethritis. Ten patients had post-gonococcal urethritis and twenty others had persistent urethritis afer a first treatment had failed. The association Chlamydia trachomatis-Staphylococcus albus was the most common bacteriologic finding. Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhea were demonstrated in 24 and 12 cases respectively. Ureaplasma urealyticum was found in only four instances. Clinical and bacteriological results show that doxycycline polyphosphate was effective in 92 out of 100 cases. Circumstances of the eight failures are analyzed specifically. Clinical tolerance was excellent in every case. Following confrontation with recent data from the literature, these results lead the authors to conclude that gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis is an indication of choice for doxycycline polyphosphate.
TI  - [Comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. Apropos of  135 cases].
AB  - The formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as Proteus sp. and some other bacteria. Ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. Its significance in the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. In this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and U. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained Proteus (27), E. coli (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Streptococcus D (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Corynebacterium (1), Candida albicans (1). U. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. Different bacteria were isolated from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). This findings suggest that Ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae in genitourinary tract infections.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in pure or predominant culture from genital specimens from nine females and two males. Four of the females had vaginitis, two had IUD-related endometritis, one had an incomplete septic abortion, and one had probable urethral syndrome. Two males had urethritis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
