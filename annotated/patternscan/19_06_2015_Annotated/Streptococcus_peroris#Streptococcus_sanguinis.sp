TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
