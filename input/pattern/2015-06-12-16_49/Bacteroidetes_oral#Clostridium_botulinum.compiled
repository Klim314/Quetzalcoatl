TI  - Persistent extraradicular infection in root-filled asymptomatic human tooth: scanning electron microscopic analysis and microbial investigation after apical microsurgery.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Procedural accidents have a negative effect on healing and might contribute to the persistence of infections in inaccessible apical areas, requiring surgical intervention. This report describes a case of persistent apical periodontitis of a lower left first molar associated with the sinus tract and a periapical lesion that required nonsurgical endodontic retreatment and apical surgery for resolution. METHODS: The tooth had received endodontic treatment 3 years ago and had to be retreated using the crown-down technique with chemical auxiliary substance (2% chlorhexidine gel), foramen patency, and enlargement and was filled in a single appointment. The occlusal access cavity was immediately restored with composite resin. After 1 month, it could be observed that the sinus tract persisted and, radiographically, the lesion remained unaltered. Therefore, endodontic microsurgery was indicated. Apical microsurgery was performed under magnification with the use of a dental operating microscope including apicectomy, root end with ultrasound, and sealing with mineral trioxide aggregate. A microbiological sample was collected from the apical lesion. The resected distal root apex was observed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The following species were detected: Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces meyeri, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium botullinum, Parvimonas micra, and Bacteroides ureolyticus; scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed bacterial biofilm surrounding the apical foramen and external radicular surface. Gutta-percha overfilling at the apex because of a zip caused during initial endodontic treatment could be observed. A 6-month follow-up showed apparent radiographic periapical healing, which progressed after 24 months. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria and extraradicular biofilm seem to participate in the maintenance of persistent periapical pathology, and endodontic retreatment followed by periapical microsurgery proved to be a successful alternative in the resolution of persistent extraradicular infections.
TI  - TLR2 transmodulates monocyte adhesion and transmigration via Rac1- and PI3K-mediated inside-out signaling in response to Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  - We present evidence for a novel TLR2 function in transmodulating the adhesive activities of human monocytes in response to the fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in chronic periodontitis and atherosclerosis. Monocyte recruitment into the subendothelium is a crucial step in atherosclerosis, and we investigated the role of P. gingivalis fimbriae in stimulating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration. Fimbriae induced CD11b/CD18-dependent adhesion of human monocytes or mouse macrophages to endothelial receptor ICAM-1; these activities were inhibited by TLR2 blockade or deficiency or by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K. Moreover, this inducible adhesive activity was sensitive to the action of Clostridium difficile toxin B, but was not affected by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, pertussis toxin, or cholera toxin. Accordingly, we subsequently showed through the use of dominant negative signaling mutants of small GTPases, that Rac1 mediates the ability of fimbria-stimulated monocytes to bind ICAM-1. A dominant negative mutant of Rac1 also inhibited the lipid kinase activity of PI3K suggesting that Rac1 acts upstream of PI3K in this proadhesive pathway. Furthermore, fimbriae stimulated monocyte adhesion to HUVEC and transmigration across HUVEC monolayers; both activities required TLR2 and Rac1 signaling and were dependent upon ICAM-1 and the high-affinity state of CD11b/CD18. P. gingivalis-stimulated monocytes displayed enhanced transendothelial migration compared with monocytes stimulated with nonfimbriated isogenic mutants. Thus, P. gingivalis fimbriae activate a novel proadhesive pathway in human monocytes, involving TLR2, Rac1, PI3K, and CD11b/CD18, which may constitute a mechanistic basis linking P. gingivalis to inflammatory atherosclerotic processes.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. Clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - Inactivation of Clostridium botulinum toxin by ruminal microbes from cattle and sheep.
AB  - Toxin from Clostridium botulinum type C was rapidly inactivated during incubation in vitro with ruminal contents from either a cow or a sheep. Fractions of ruminal contents from which cells had been removed by high-speed centrifugation did not inactivate toxin. Inactivation was associated with fractions containing bacteria, whereas fractions containing protozoa and relatively few bacteria were much less active. This activity may help explain the relatively greater tolerance by ruminants to oral doses of botulinum toxin than to toxin administered by other routes. The results are also pertinent to assays for botulinum toxin from gastrointestinal samples obtained postmortem.
