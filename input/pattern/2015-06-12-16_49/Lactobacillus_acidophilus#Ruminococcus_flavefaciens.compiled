TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA terminal restriction fragment pattern analysis of bacterial communities in feces of rats fed Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM.
AB  - 16S ribosomal DNA terminal restriction fragment patterns from rat fecal samples were analyzed to track the dynamics of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and discern bacterial populations that changed during feeding with NCFM. Lactobacillus johnsonii and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were tentatively identified as such bacterial populations. The presence of L. johnsonii was confirmed by isolation from feces.
