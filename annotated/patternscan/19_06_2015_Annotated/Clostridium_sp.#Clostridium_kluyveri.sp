TI  == characterization of the central metabolic pathways in thermoanaerobacter sp. strain x514 via isotopomer-assisted metabolite analysis.
AB  == thermoanaerobacter sp. strain x514 has great potential in biotechnology due to its capacity to ferment a range of c(5) and c(6) sugars to ethanol and other metabolites under thermophilic conditions. this study investigated the central metabolism of strain x514 via (13)c-labeled tracer experiments using either glucose or pyruvate as both carbon and energy sources. x514 grew on minimal medium and thus contains complete biosynthesis pathways for all macromolecule building blocks. based on genome annotation and isotopic analysis of amino acids, three observations can be obtained about the central metabolic pathways in x514.  first, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in x514 is not functional, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is incomplete under fermentative growth conditions. second, x514 contains (re)-type citrate synthase activity, although no gene homologous to the recently characterized (re)-type citrate synthase of clostridium kluyveri was found. third, the isoleucine in x514 is derived from acetyl coenzyme a and pyruvate via the citramalate pathway rather than being synthesized from threonine via threonine ammonia-lyase. the functionality of the  citramalate synthase gene (cima [teth514_1204]) has been confirmed by enzymatic activity assays, while the presence of intracellular citramalate has been detected by mass spectrometry. this study demonstrates the merits of combining (13)c-assisted metabolite analysis, enzyme assays, and metabolite detection not only to examine genome sequence annotations but also to discover novel enzyme activities.

TI  == stereo-specificity for pro-(r) hydrogen of nad(p)h during enzyme-catalyzed hydride transfer to cl-20.
AB  == a dehydrogenase from clostridium sp. edb2 and a diaphorase from clostridium kluyveri were reacted with cl-20 to gain insights into the enzyme-catalyzed hydride transfer to cl-20, and the enzyme's stereo-specificity for either pro-r or pro-s hydrogens of nad(p)h. both enzymes biotransformed cl-20 at rates of 18.5 and 24nmol/h/mg protein, using nadh and nadph as hydride-source, respectively, to produce a n-denitrohydrogenated product with a molecular weight of 393da. in enzyme kinetics studies using reduced deuterated pyridine nucleotides, we found a kinetic deuterium isotopic effect of 2-fold on cl-20 biotransformation rate using dehydrogenase enzyme against (r)nadd as a hydride-source compared to either (s)nadd or nadh. whereas, in case of diaphorase, the kinetic deuterium isotopic effect of about 1.5-fold was observed on cl-20 biotransformation rate using (r)nadpd as hydride-source. in a comparative study with lc-ms, using deuterated and non-deuterated nad(p)h, we found a positive mass-shift of 1da in the n-denitrohydrogenated product suggesting the involvement of a deuteride (d(-)) transfer from nad(p)d. the present study thus revealed that both dehydrogenase and diaphorase enzymes from the two clostridium species catalyzed a hydride transfer to cl-20 and showed stereo-specificity for pro-r hydrogen of nad(p)h.

TI  == assignment of fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria to syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov. on the basis of 16s rrna sequence analyses.
AB  == after enrichment from chinese rural anaerobic digestor sludge, anaerobic, sporing and nonsporing, saturated fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophic bacteria were isolated as cocultures with h2- and formate-utilizing methanospirillum hungatei or desulfovibrio sp. strain g-11. the syntrophs degraded c4 to c8 saturated fatty acids, including isobutyrate and 2-methylbutyrate. they were adapted to grow on crotonate and were isolated as pure cultures. the crotonate-grown pure cultures alone did not grow on butyrate in either the presence or the absence of some common electron acceptors. however, when they were reconstituted with m. hungatei, growth on butyrate again occurred. in contrast, crotonate-grown clostridium kluyveri and clostridium sticklandii, as well as clostridium sporogenes, failed to grow on butyrate when these organisms were cocultured with  m. hungatei. the crotonate-grown pure subcultures of the syntrophs described above were subjected to 16s rrna sequence analysis. several previously documented fatty acid-beta-oxidizing syntrophs grown in pure cultures with crotonate were also subjected to comparative sequence analyses. the sequence analyses revealed that the new sporing and nonsporing isolates and other syntrophs that we sequenced, which had either gram-negative or gram-positive cell wall ultrastructure, all belonged to the phylogenetically gram-positive phylum. they were not closely related to any of the previously known subdivisions in the gram-positive phylum with which they were compared, but were closely related to each other, forming a new subdivision in the phylum. we recommend that this group be designated syntrophomonadaceae fam. nov.; a description is given.

TI  == simultaneous single-step purification of thiolase and nadp-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase from clostridium kluyveri.
AB  == thiolase and nadp-dependent 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase from clostridium kluyveri were purified by ion-exchange chromatography to near homogeneity in a simultaneous, single-step procedure. the yield of both enzymes was greater than 80%. thiolase was purified approximately 8-fold with sp act 115 units/mg, whereas 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase was purified 14-fold with sp act 292 units/mg. isoelectric points of the enzymes are 7.7 for thiolase and 7.8 for 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase. milligram quantities of each of these enzymes are readily obtained from this fatty acid-producing organism.
