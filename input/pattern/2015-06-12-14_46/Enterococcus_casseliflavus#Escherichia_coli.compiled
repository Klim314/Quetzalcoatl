TI  - Enterococci as Indicators of Environmental Fecal Contamination
AB  - Enterococci are found in high concentrations in human feces, usually between 104  and 106 bacteria per gram wet weight (Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010; Slanetz & Bartley, 1957; Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962); see also Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization). Although enterococci usually represent less than 1% of the flora (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003), they are usually present in the fecal consortium, but are outnumbered by other bacteria, including Escherichia coli, clostridia, and the Bacteroidales (Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962). Due to their ubiquity in human feces and persistence in the environment, enterococci have been adopted as indicators of human fecal pollution in water. More recently, their densities on human hands have been used as indicators of hand hygiene. The use of enterococci as indicators of human fecal pollution or contamination can be problematic, however, because enterococci are also found in animal feces (Harwood, Whitlock, & Withington, 2000; Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010), in soils (Byappanahalli & Fujioka, 2004; Goto & Yan, 2011), and on plants (Byappanahalli, Shively, Nevers, Sadowsky, & Whitman, 2003; Imamura, Thompson, Boehm, & Jay, 2011; Muller, Ulrich, Ott, & Muller, 2001). Although there is debate about the extent to which this happens in nature, there is evidence that enterococci are capable of replicating in extra-enteric environments, such as on beach sands (Bahirathan, Puente, & Seyfried, 1998; Zubrzycki & Spaulding, 1962) and in water containing kelp (Byappanahalli, Shively, Nevers, Sadowsky, & Whitman, 2003; Imamura, Thompson, Boehm, & Jay, 2011) and plankton (Mote, Turner, & Lipp, 2012). Identification of human-specific enterococcal species or genotypes could aid in the discrimination of human fecal contamination from other environmental sources of the organisms. Some data suggest that Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis may be more prevalent in human feces than other enterococcal species, while Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii may be more abundant in environmental reservoirs (such as on plants) than other species (Bahirathan, Puente, & Seyfried, 1998; Ferguson, Moore, Getrich, & Zhowandai, 2005; Wheeler, Hartel, Godfrey, Hill, & Segars, 2002). However, a number of species of Enterococcus have been isolated from human feces (Layton, Walters, Lam, & Boehm, 2010); Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization), so it will be difficult to derive a single host-specific indicator. It has been suggested that E. faecium that contains the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene may be human-specific (Scott, Jenkins, Lukasik, & Rose, 2005), but esp-containing E. faecium can also be found in select animal hosts (Layton, Walters, & Boehm, 2009; Whitman, Przybyla-Kelly, Shively, & Byappanahalli, 2007). Fecal enterococci from the GI tract consortia of healthy humans are generally not virulent. Nevertheless, multidrug-resistant Enterococcus strains have emerged as leading causes of hospital-acquired infections (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are particularly important pathogens (Willems, et al., 2005), as are esp-containing E. faecalis (Shankar, Baghdayan, Huycke, Lindahl, & Gilmore, 1999) and E. faecium (Willems, et al., 2001), as well as other types of E. faecalis and E. faecium (Wisplinghoff, Bischoff, Tallent, Seifert, Wenzel, & Edmond, 2004). It is estimated that there are 800,000 cases of enterococcal infection in the US each year, adding $500,000,000 to annual healthcare costs (Tendolkar, Baghdayan, & Shankar, 2003). Therefore, the presence of enterococci in the environment and on hands may have important direct health implications.
TI  - The metabolism of methylsulfinylalkyl- and methylthioalkyl-glucosinolates by a selection of human gut bacteria.
AB  - SCOPE: Certain myrosinase-positive human gut bacteria can metabolize glucosinolates (GSLs) to produce isothiocyanates (ITC) as chemopreventive agents. We investigated glucoerucin, glucoiberin, and glucoraphanin (present in broccoli) metabolism by human gut strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: All tested bacteria metabolized glucoerucin to completion within 16 h to erucin and erucin nitrile (NIT). Lactobacillus agilis R16 metabolized only 10% of glucoiberin and glucoraphanin with no detectable products. Enterococcus casseliflavus CP1, however, metabolized 40-50% of glucoiberin and glucoraphanin producing relatively low concentrations of iberin and sulforaphane. Interestingly, Escherichia coli VL8 metabolized 80-90% of glucoiberin and glucoraphanin and also bioconverted glucoraphanin and glucoiberin to glucoerucin and glucoiberverin, respectively, producing erucin, erucin NIT, iberverin, and iberverin NIT from the two GSLs. The putative reductase enzyme in the cell-free extracts of this bacterium required both Mg(2+) and NAD(P)H as cofactors for bioconversion. The cell-free extract of E. coli VL8 containing the reductase enzyme was able to reduce both the GSL glucoraphanin and its hydrolysis product sulforaphane to glucoerucin and erucin/erucin NIT, respectively. CONCLUSION: The composition and metabolic activity of the human gut bacteria can indirectly impact on the potential chemopreventive effects of GSL-derived metabolites.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat salads: an underestimated vehicle of bacteria and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  - The increase demand for fresh vegetables is causing an expansion of the market for minimally processed vegetables along with new recognized food safety problems. To gain further insight on this topic we analyzed the microbiological quality of Portuguese ready-to-eat salads (RTS) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying acquired antibiotic resistance genes, food products scarcely considered in surveillance studies. A total of 50 RTS (7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, corn) were collected in 5 national supermarket chains in Porto region (2010). They were tested for aerobic mesophilic counts, coliforms and Escherichia coli counts as well as for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were also plated in different selective media with/without antibiotics before and after enrichment. The E. coli, other coliforms and Enterococcus recovered were characterized for antibiotic resistance profiles and clonality with phenotypic and genetic approaches. A high number of RTS presented poor microbiological quality (86%--aerobic mesophilic counts, 74%--coliforms, 4%--E. coli), despite the absence of screened pathogens. In addition, a high diversity of bacteria (species and clones) and antibiotic resistance backgrounds (phenotypes and genotypes) were observed, mostly with enrichment and antibiotic selective media. E. coli was detected in 13 samples (n=78; all types and 4 brands; phylogenetic groups A, B1 and D; none STEC) with resistance to tetracycline [72%; tet(A) and/or tet(B)], streptomycin (58%; aadA and/or strA-strB), sulfamethoxazole (50%; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (50%; dfrA1 or dfrA12), ampicillin (49%; blaTEM), nalidixic acid (36%), ciprofloxacin (5%) or chloramphenicol (3%; catA). E. coli clones, including the widespread group D/ST69, were detected in different samples from the same brand or different brands pointing out to a potential cross-contamination. Other clinically relevant resistance genes were detected in 2 Raoultella terrigena carrying a bla(SHV-2) and 1 Citrobacter freundii isolate with a qnrB9 gene. Among Enterococcus (n=108; 35 samples; Enterococcus casseliflavus--40, Enterococcus faecalis--20, Enterococcus faecium--18, Enterococcus hirae--9, Enterococcus gallinarum--5, and Enterococcus spp.--16) resistance was detected for tetracyclines [6%; tet(M) and/or tet(L)], erythromycin [3%; erm(B)], nitrofurantoin (1%) or ciprofloxacin (1%). The present study places ready-to-eat salads within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be vehicles for antibiotic resistance bacteria/genes with clinical interest (e.g. E. coli-D-ST69; bla(SHV-2)) and these findings are worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed.
TI  - Cloning and heterologous expression of plnE, -F, -J and -K genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  - Plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plnE, -F, -J and -K structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. These amplicons were cloned and expressed in pET32a (+) vector in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). PlnE, -F, -J and -K peptides were expressed as His-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by Ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. The peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. The cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against Listeria innocua NRRL B33314, Micrococcus luteus MTCC 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as Enterococcus casseliflavus NRRL B3502, Lactococcus lactis lactis NRRL 1821, Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B4562 and Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B4496. E. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. Heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray for enterococcal species, virulence, and antibiotic resistance gene determinations among isolates from poultry.
AB  - A DNA microarray (Enteroarray) was designed with probes targeting four species-specific taxonomic identifiers to discriminate among 18 different enterococcal species, while other probes were designed to identify 18 virulence factors and 174 antibiotic resistance genes. In total, 262 genes were utilized for rapid species identification of enterococcal isolates, while characterizing their virulence potential through the simultaneous identification of endogenous antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Enterococcal isolates from broiler chicken farms were initially identified by using the API 20 Strep system, and the results were compared to those obtained with the taxonomic genes atpA, recA, pheS, and ddl represented on our microarray. Among the 171 isolates studied, five different enterococcal species were identified by using the API 20 Strep system: Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. avium. The Enteroarray detected the same species as API 20 Strep, as well as two more: E. casseliflavus and E. hirae. Species comparisons resulted in 15% (27 isolates) disagreement between the two methods among the five API 20 Strep identifiable species and 24% (42 isolates) disagreement when considering the seven Enteroarray identified species. The species specificity of key antibiotic and virulence genes identified by the Enteroarray were consistent with the literature adding further robustness to the redundant taxonomic probe data. Sequencing of the cpn60 gene further confirmed the complete accuracy of the microarray results. The new Enteroarray should prove to be a useful tool to accurately genotype strains of enterococci and assess their virulence potential.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal indicators in municipal wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of fecal coliforms (n = 153) and enterococci (n = 199) isolates was investigated in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) based on activated sludge system. The number of fecal indicators (in influent and effluent as well as in the aeration chamber and in return activated sludge mixture) was determined using selective media. Susceptibility of selected strains was tested against 19 (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, carbapenems, cephalosporins, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, penicillines, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and 17 (high-level aminoglycosides, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, linezolid, lincosamides, nitrofuration, streptogramins, tetracycline) antimicrobial agents respectively. Among enterococci the predominant species were Enterococcus faecium (60.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (22.1%), while remaining isolates belonged to Enterococcus hirae (12.1%), Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum (4.5%), and Enterococcus durans (0.5%). Resistance to nitrofuration and erythromycin was common among enterococci (53% and 44%, respectively), and followed by resistance to ciprofloxacin (29%) and tetracycline (20%). The resistance phenotypes related to glycopeptides (up to 3.2%) and high-level aminoglycosides (up to 5.4%) were also observed. Most frequently, among Escherichia coli isolates the resistance patterns were found for ampicillin (34%), piperacillin (24%) and tetracycline (23%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli was detected once, in the aeration chamber. In the study the applied wastewater treatment processes considerably reduced the number of fecal indicators. Nevertheless their number in the WWTP effluent was higher than 10(4) CFU per 100 ml and periodically contained 90% of bacteria with antimicrobial resistance patterns. The positive selection of isolates with antimicrobial resistance patterns was observed during the treatment processes. Substantial concern should be paid to the isolates resistant to 3 or more chemical classes of antimicrobials (MAR). In treated wastewater MAR E. coli and MAR enterococci constituted respectively 9% and 29% of tested isolates.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp.) in feral pigeons.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the presence of antibiotic-resistant faecal Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. in feral pigeons (Columba livia forma domestica) in the Czech Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cloacal swabs of feral pigeons collected in the city of Brno in 2006 were cultivated for antibiotic-resistant E. coli. Resistance genes, class 1 and 2 integrons, and gene cassettes were detected in resistant isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The samples were also cultivated for enterococci. Species status of enterococci isolates was determined using repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR. Resistance genes were detected in resistant enterococci by PCR. E. coli isolates were found in 203 of 247 pigeon samples. Antibiotic resistance was recorded in three (1.5%, n(E. coli) =203) isolates. Using agar containing ciprofloxacin, 12 (5%, n(samples) =247) E. coli strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were isolated. No ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were detected. A total of 143 enterococci were isolated: Ent. faecalis (36 isolates), Ent. faecium (27), Ent. durans (19), Ent. hirae (17), Ent. mundtii (17), Ent. gallinarum (12), Ent. casseliflavus (12) and Ent. columbae (3). Resistance to one to four antibiotics was detected in 45 (31%) isolates. Resistances were determined by tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, aac(6')aph(2''), ant(4')-Ia, aph(3')-IIIa, ermB, pbp5, vanA and vanC1 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-resistant E. coli and Enterococcus spp. occurred in feral pigeons in various prevalences. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Feral pigeon should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant E. coli and enterococci.
TI  - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of Enterococcus casseliflavus aminoglycoside-2''-phosphotransferase-IVa.
AB  - The deactivation of aminoglycoside antibiotics by chemical modification is one of the major sources of bacterial resistance to this family of therapeutic compounds, which includes the clinically relevant drugs streptomycin, kanamycin and gentamicin. The aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APHs) form one such family of enzymes responsible for this resistance. The gene encoding one of these enzymes, aminoglycoside-2''-phosphotransferase-IVa [APH(2'')-IVa] from Enterococcus casseliflavus, has been cloned and the protein (comprising 306 amino-acid residues) has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The enzyme was crystallized in three substrate-free forms. Two of the crystal forms belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with similar unit-cell parameters, although one of the crystal forms had a unit-cell volume that was approximately 13% smaller than the other and a very low solvent content of around 38%. The third crystal form belonged to the monoclinic space group P2(1) and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis was consistent with the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The orthorhombic crystal forms of apo APH(2'')-IVa both diffracted to 2.2 A resolution and the monoclinic crystal form diffracted to 2.4 A resolution; synchrotron diffraction data were collected from these crystals at SSRL (Stanford, California, USA). Structure determination by molecular replacement using the structure of the related enzyme APH(2'')-IIa is proceeding.
TI  - Rapid QPCR-based assay for fecal Bacteroides spp. as a tool for assessing fecal contamination in recreational waters.
AB  - Concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB; e.g. Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus sp.) can only be used in limited ways for determining the source of fecal contamination in recreational waters because they cannot distinguish human from non-human fecal contamination. Several Bacteroides spp. have been suggested as potential alternative indicators. We have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal Bacteroides spp. using quantitative PCR (QPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common human Bacteroides spp. The details of the method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. Specificity and performance of the QPCR assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. Concentrations of fecal Bacteroides spp., total Enterococcus sp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using QPCR, and total Enterococcus sp. and E. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (MF). Samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total Enterococcus sp., E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are prominent in animal feces. On the other hand, fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in samples spiked with gull guano. Sensitivity and specificity results suggest that the rapid fecal Bacteroides spp. QPCR assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.
TI  - Salmonella, Campylobacter and Enterococcus spp.: their antimicrobial resistance profiles and their spatial relationships in a synoptic study of the Upper Oconee River basin.
AB  - Rivers may serve as reservoirs for enteric organisms. Very little is known about  the boundaries of microbial communities in moving bodies of water so this study was undertaken to find the limits of distribution of some bacteria, focusing on enteric organisms. The presence of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Enterococcus spp. and the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes carried by these organisms was evaluated for the Upper Oconee River basin, a small river in the lower Piedmont of northeastern Georgia, USA. Samples were obtained from 83 sites during a 3-h period on a spring day (April 2005) in an approximately 30 x 20 km region. Campylobacter spp. was isolated at 12 sites. The Campylobacter isolates from three sites were resistant to tetracycline. Of the five short-variable region (SVR) subtypes of Campylobacter that were found, three were found at more than one site, two types were found twice, and one subtype was found three times. Enterococcus was isolated at 71 sites. E. casseliflavus was the most common species. Based on species identification and antimicrobial resistance patterns, 24 types of Enterococcus were found. Salmonella was isolated from 62 sites. Of the 19 Salmonella serovars that were isolated, serovar Muenchen accounted for about 20% of the isolates. The next three most common serovars isolated, Rubislaw, Hartford, and Give, accounted for about 44% of the river isolates. Antimicrobial resistance profiling offered limited differentiation of Salmonella isolates because only seven isolates were resistant to any antimicrobial. The sites at which Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Enterococcus were isolated did not correlate with each other or with the total coliform number or Escherichia coli count for the site. However, isolates of some of the same species and type occurred in clusters that were restricted to areas within 5 to 6 km.
TI  - Insertion sequence ISEcp1-like element connected with a novel aph(2'') allele [aph(2'')-Ie] conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a novel streptomycin adenylyltransferase gene in Enterococcus.
AB  - Enterococcus casseliflavus HZ95 is an enterococcus with high-level resistance to  aminoglycosides. Nine genes responsible for high-level aminoglycoside resistance, including aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, aph(2'')-Ib, aph(2'')-Ic, aph(2'')-Id, aph(3')-IIIa, aac(6')-Ii, ant(3')-Ia, ant(4')-Ia and ant(6')-Ia, were not detected in HZ95. An 8 kb fragment from unconjugative plasmids of HZ95 was cloned, and expressed gentamicin resistance in Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The genetic structures ( approximately 8 kb DNA fragment) containing these aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes in Ent. casseliflavus HZ95 were determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the novel aph(2'') allele, aph(2'')-Ie, had 93.7 % amino acid identity with APH(2'')-Id. The aph(2'')-Ie gene was bracketed upstream by an insertion sequence (IS)Ecp1-like element and downstream by a streptomycin adenylyltransferase gene (str). The streptomycin adenylyltransferase encoded by the str gene had 80.3 % amino acid identity with the protein encoded by aadE. The plasmid of approximately 16 kb could hybridize with a PCR-generated aph(2'')-Ie intragenic probe. The ISEcp1-like element had 91 % identity with ISEcp1. ISEcp1, which commonly acts as a key factor in the dissemination of CTX-M-type beta-lactamase genes in Gram-negative bacteria, has not been reported in Enterococcus.
TI  - Mutagenicity of arbutin in mammalian cells after activation by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Arbutin (hydroquinone-beta-D-glucopyranoside) is present in various food plants.  Its aglycone, hydroquinone, is mutagenic and carcinogenic. We investigated whether hydroquinone may be released under conditions encountered in the human gastrointestinal tract. Arbutin was stable in artificial gastric juice. Fecal slurries from nine human subjects completely converted arbutin (2 mM) into hydroquinone. Four of nine representative human intestinal species investigated, namely Eubacterium ramulus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, deglycosylated arbutin at rates of 21.08, 16.62, 8.43 and 3.59 nmol x min(-1) x (mg protein)(-1), respectively. In contrast, homogenates from small intestinal mucosa and cytosolic fractions from colon mucosa deglycosylated arbutin at substantially lower rates: 0.50 and 0.09 nmol x min(-1) x (mg protein)(-1), respectively. Arbutin, unlike hydroquinone, did not induce gene mutations in Chinese hamster V79 cells in the absence of an activating system. However, in the presence of cytosolic fractions from E. ramulus or B. distasonis, arbutin was strongly mutagenic. Cytosolic fraction from Escherichia coli, showing no arbutin glycosidase activity, was not able to activate arbutin in this model system. The release of the proximate mutagen hydroquinone from arbutin by intestinal bacteria in the immediate vicinity of the colon mucosa may pose a potential risk.
TI  - Partial characterization of enterocin MR99 from a corn silage isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The inhibitory activity of strains of Enterococcus faecalis (58), Enterococcus faecium (35), Enterococcus gallinarum (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and ATCC). Enterococcus faecalis MR99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. The bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. The partially chromatography-purified MR99 enterocin (PPE) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 Da and a pI of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. It appeared stable to adjustment of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. Inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees C. Enterocin MR99 was bactericidal on strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staph. aureus, and bovine mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on E. coli. Although enterocins MR99 and AS48 have inhibitory activity on Gram-negative bacilli, PCR studies demonstrated a lack of relationship between them. CONCLUSIONS: The active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological properties of Ent. faecalis MR99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied in human and veterinary health programmes.
TI  - Enterococcus casseliflavus bacteremia. Case report and literature review.
AB  - Motile Enterococci are rare causes of enterococcal bacteremia, usually in immunocompromised patients. We describe a case of polymicrobial bacteremia, including Enterococcus casseliflavus, Escherichia coli, and Morganella morganii, in an 80-year old woman, shortly after a liver biopsy performed to exclude cholangiocarcinoma. We further discuss the unique genetic characteristics and the clinical significance of such isolates, such as their intrinsic resistance to vancomycin, and the low virulence exhibited clinically. Further workup on the mechanisms of motile Enterococci resistance to vancomycin could probably yield useful information in achieving new ways of facing resistance attributed to the more usual, and malignant Enterococci.
TI  - Structures of enterococcal glycerol kinase in the absence and presence of glycerol: correlation of conformation to substrate binding and a mechanism of activation by phosphorylation.
AB  - The first structure of a glycerol kinase from a Gram-positive organism, Enterococcus casseliflavus, has been determined to 2.8 A resolution in the presence of glycerol and to 2.5 A resolution in the absence of substrate. The substrate-induced closure of 7 degrees is significantly smaller than that reported for hexokinase, a model for substrate-mediated domain closure that has been proposed for glycerol kinase. Despite the 78% level of sequence identity and conformational similarity in the catalytic cleft regions of the En. casseliflavus and Escherichia coli glycerol kinases, remarkable structural differences have now been identified. These differences correlate well with their divergent regulatory schemes of activation by phosphorylation in En. casseliflavus and allosteric inhibition in E. coli. On the basis of our structural results, we propose a mechanism by which the phosphorylation of a histidyl residue located 25 A from the active site results in a 10-15-fold increase in the activity of the enterococcal glycerol kinase.
TI  - Species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in Germany.
AB  - Presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and Escherichia coli. Especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. We attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. From November 2000 to May 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in Germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. From these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. The most frequent species was Enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found Enterococcus faecium (54 strains), Enterococcus durans together with Enterococcus hirae (24 strains), Enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), Enterococcus avium (9 strains) and Enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). We focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected E. faecium and E. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). From the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. The investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. These antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. Only one E. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
TI  - Diversity of domain V of 23S rRNA gene sequence in different Enterococcus species.
AB  - The highly conserved central loop of domain V of 23S RNA (nucleotides 2042 to 2628; Escherichia coli numbering) is implicated in peptidyltransferase activity and represents one of the target sites for macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B antibiotics. DNA encoding domain V (590 bp) of several species of Enterococcus was amplified by PCR. Twenty enterococcal isolates were tested, including Enterococcus faecium (six isolates), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus casseliflavus (two isolates of each), and Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus malodoratus, and Enterococcus hirae (one isolate of each). For all isolates, species identification by biochemical testing was corroborated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The sequence of domain V of the 23S rRNA gene from E. faecium and E. faecalis differed from those of all other enterococci. The domain V sequences of E. durans and E. hirae were identical. This was also true for E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus. E. avium differed from E. casseliflavus by 23 bases, from E. durans by 16 bases, and from E. malodoratus by 2 bases. E. avium differed from E. raffinosus by one base. Despite the fact that domain V is considered to be highly conserved, substantial differences were identified between several enterococcal species.
TI  - The soluble alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from Enterococcus casseliflavus. Sequence homology with the membrane-associated dehydrogenase and kinetic analysis of the recombinant enzyme.
AB  - The soluble flavoprotein alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase from Enterococcus casseliflavus catalyzes the oxidation of a "non-activated" secondary alcohol, in contrast to the flavin-dependent alpha-hydroxy- and alpha-amino acid oxidases. Surprisingly, the alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase sequence is 43% identical to that of the membrane-associated alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis; only low levels of identity (17-22%) result from comparisons with other FAD-dependent oxidases. The recombinant alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase is fully active and stabilizes a flavin N(5)-sulfite adduct, but only small amounts of intermediate flavin semiquinone are observed during reductive titrations. Direct determination of the redox potential for the FAD/FADH2 couple yields a value of -118 mV; the protein environment raises the flavin potential by 100 mV in order to provide for a productive interaction with the reducing substrate. Steady-state kinetic analysis, using the enzyme-monitored turnover method, indicates that a ping-pong mechanism applies and also allows the determination of the corresponding kinetic constants. In addition, stopped-flow studies of the reductive half-reaction provide for the measurement of the dissociation constant for the enzyme. alpha-glycerophosphate complex and the rate constant for reduction of the enzyme flavin. These and other results demonstrate that this enzyme offers a very promising paradigm for examining the protein determinants for flavin reactivity and mechanism in the energy-yielding metabolism of alpha-glycerophosphate.
TI  - The effect of pH on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
AB  - Butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. It  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. To investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of pH and butyric acid concentrations. Six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus. At pH 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. At pH 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mM. The maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mM, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at pH values occurring in the stomach. Therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
TI  - Active-site mutants of the VanC2 D-alanyl-D-serine ligase, characteristic of one  vancomycin-resistant bacterial phenotype, revert towards wild-type D-alanyl-D-alanine ligases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising number of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VREs) is a major concern to modern medicine because vancomycin is currently the 'last resort' drug for life-threatening infections. The D-alanyl-D-X ligases (where X is an hydroxy or amino acid) of bacteria catalyze a critical step in bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan assembly. In bacteria that produce glycopeptide antibiotics and in opportunistic pathogens, including VREs, D-, D-ligases serve as switches that confer antibiotic resistance on the bacteria themselves. Peptidoglycans in vancomycin-sensitive bacteria end in D-alanyl-D-alanine, whereas in vancomycin-resistant bacteria they end in D-alanyl-D-lactate or D-alanyl-D-serine. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the selective utilization of D-serine by the Enterococcus casseliflavus VanC2 ligase can be altered by mutagenesis of one of two residues identified by homology to the X-ray structure of the Escherichia coli D-alanyl-Dalanine ligase (DdlB). The Arg322-->Met (R322M) and Phe250-->Tyr (F250Y) ligase mutants show a 36-44-fold decrease in the use of D-serine, as well as broadened specificity for utilization of other D-amino acids in place of D-serine. The F250Y R322M double mutant is effectively disabled as a D-alanyl-D-serine ligase and retains 10% of the catalytic activity of wild-type D-alanyl-D-alanine ligases, reflecting a 6,000-fold switch to the D-alanyl-D-alanine peptide. Correspondingly, the Leu282-->Arg mutant of the wild-type E. coli DdlB produced a 560-fold switch towards D-alanyl-D-serine formation. CONCLUSIONS: Single-residue changes in the active-site regions of D-, D-ligases can cause substantial changes in recognition and activation of hydroxy or amino acids that have consequences for glycopeptide antibiotic efficacy. The observations reported here should provide an approach for combatting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - A new high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2'')-Id, in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Enterococcus casseliflavus UC73 is a clinical blood isolate with high-level resistance to gentamicin. DNA preparations from UC73 failed to hybridize with intragenic probes for aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia and aph(2'')-Ic. A 4-kb fragment from UC73 was cloned and found to confer resistance to gentamicin in Escherichia coli DH5alpha transformants. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a 906-bp open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence had a region with homology to the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme APH(2'')-Ic and to the C-terminal domain of the bifunctional enzyme AAC(6')-APH(2''). The gene is designated aph(2'')-Id, and its observed phosphotransferase activity is designated APH(2'')-Id. A PCR-generated intragenic probe hybridized to the genomic DNA from 17 of 118 enterococcal clinical isolates (108 with high-level gentamicin resistance) from five hospitals. All 17 were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates, and pulsed-field typing revealed three distinct clones. The combination of ampicillin plus either amikacin or neomycin exhibited synergistic killing against E. casseliflavus UC73. Screening and interpretation of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci may need to be modified to include detection of APH(2'')-Id.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to vancomycin: overproduction, purification, and characterization of VanC2 from Enterococcus casseliflavus as a D-Ala-D-Ser ligase.
AB  - The VanC phenotype for clinical resistance of enterococci to vancomycin is exhibited by Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus. Based on the detection of the cell precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid pentapeptide intermediate terminating in D-Ala-D-Ser instead of D-Ala-D-Ala, it has been predicted that the VanC ligase would be a D-Ala-D-Ser rather than a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase. Overproduction of the E. casseliflavus ATCC 25788 vanC2 gene in Escherichia coli and its purification to homogeneity allowed demonstration of ATP-dependent D-Ala-D-Ser ligase activity. The kcat/Km2 (Km2 = Km for D-Ser or C-terminal D-Ala) ratio for D-Ala-D-Ser/D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide formation is 270/0.69 for a 400-fold selection against D-Ala in the C-terminal position. VanC2 also has substantial D-Ala-D-Asn ligase activity (kcat/Km2 = 74 mM-1min-1).
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of two enterococcal glpK genes and regulation of the encoded glycerol kinases by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent, phosphotransferase system-catalyzed phosphorylation of a single histidyl residue.
AB  - The glpK genes of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus faecalis, encoding  glycerol kinase, the key enzyme of glycerol uptake and metabolism in bacteria, have been cloned and sequenced. The translated amino acid sequences exhibit strong homology to the amino acid sequences of other bacterial glycerol kinases. After expression of the enterococcal glpK genes in Escherichia coli, both glycerol kinases were purified and were found to be phosphorylated by enzyme I and the histidine-containing protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation caused a 9-fold increase in enzyme activity. The site of phosphorylation in glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus was determined as His-232. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to replace His-232 in glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus with an alanyl, glutamate, or arginyl residue. The mutant proteins could no longer be phosphorylated confirming that His-232 of E. casseliflavus glycerol kinase represents the site of phosphorylation. The His232 --> Arg glycerol kinase exhibited an about 3-fold elevated activity compared with wild-type glycerol kinase. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was found to inhibit E. casseliflavus glycerol kinase activity. However, neither EIIAGlc from E. coli nor the EIIAGlc domain of Bacillus subtilis had an inhibitory effect on glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus.
TI  - The gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 of Enterococcus faecalis is useful for development of a species-specific DNA probe.
AB  - Recently, in Escherichia coli was cloned a Sau3AI 3.4-kb fragment containing the  gene encoding for penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) of Enterococcus faecalis. The structural gene for the PBP of E. faecalis and the flanking regions were entirely sequenced (C. Signoretto, M. Boaretti, and P. Canepari, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 123:99-106, 1994). When the entire cloned E. faecalis DNA insert, labeled with digoxigenin, was used as a probe to detect a homology gene in enterococci, it was observed that only DNAs of all the E. faecalis strains reacted to the probe. The same results were obtained when a HindIII fragment of 0.35 kb from the entire insert of 3.4 kb was used. In this study we tested a total of 62 clinically isolated enterococcal strains, belonging to the species E. faecalis (36 strains), E. faecium (13), E. gallinarum (6), E. bovis (2) E. avium (3), E. hirae (1), and E. casseliflavus (1). The results indicate that both the entire segment and the HindIII fragment may be useful for preparing a species-specific probe for rapid identification of E. faecalis species.
TI  - Analysis of genes encoding D-alanine-D-alanine ligase-related enzymes in Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus flavescens.
AB  - Using degenerate oligonucleotides complementary to sequences encoding conserved amino acid motifs in D-alanine-D-alanine (Ddl) ligases, we have amplified ca. 600-bp fragments from Enterococcus casseliflavus ATCC 25788 and Enterococcus flavescens CCM439. Sequence analysis of the amplification products indicated that each strain possessed two genes, ddlE. cass. and vanC-2, and ddlE. flav. and vanC-3, respectively, encoding Ddl-related enzymes. The fragments internal to the vanC genes were 98.3% identical. The vanC-2 gene was cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. Extensive similarity (66% nucleotide identity) was detected between this gene and vanC-1 from Enterococcus gallinarum (S. Dutka-Malen, C. Molinas, M. Arthur, and P. Courvalin, Gene 112:53-58, 1992), suggesting that the vanC genes are required for intrinsic low-level resistance to vancomycin. The partial deduced amino acid sequences of ddlE. cass. and ddlE. flav. were identical and closely related to that of the Ddl ligase of Enterococcus faecalis (79% identity). In Southern hybridization experiments, only DNA from E. casseliflavus and E. flavescens hybridized to probes internal to the vanC-2 and ddlE. cass. genes.
TI  - Distribution of group D streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
