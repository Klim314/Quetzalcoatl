effect of yeast with bacteriocin from rumen bacteria on laying performance, blood biochemistry, faecal microbiota and egg quality of laying hens.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of yeast with bacteriocin from ruminococcus albus 7 (albusin b) on physiological state and production performance of laying hens. one hundred and twenty 26-week-old single comb white leghorn (hyline) laying hens were assigned into five groups including: (i) control group, (ii) yeast control (yc), (iii) 0.125% yeast with bacteriocin (0.125b), (iv) 0.25% yeast with bacteriocin (0.25b) and (v) 0.5% yeast with bacteriocin (0.5b). all supplements were added to the experimental diets of the hens from 26 to 46 weeks of age. samples were collected every 4 weeks. blood samples were collected from the wing vein for blood biochemical parameters assay, and faecal samples were collected by swab for the microbiota test. the egg production performance was recorded daily, and fresh eggs were collected for quality test. the blood biochemical assay results indicated that the addition of yeast with bacteriocin decreased the ast (aspartate aminotransferase) activity and it also affects the lactate concentration in laying hen blood. the result of egg quality indicated that yeast with bacteriocin supplementation had no effect on the mass of yolk and the strength of eggshell, but it had positive effect on the laying performance under hot environment. low concentration bacteriocin (0.125b) supplementation could decrease total yolk cholesterol. the faecal microbiota result indicated that the supplementation of bacteriocin increased the lactobacilli counts. the yeast with bacteriocin supplementation significantly decreased the clostridia counts under hot environment condition, especially in hens receiving 0.25b. combining the data from clinic chemistry, faecal microbiota, egg production and egg quality, the 0.25b supplementation may result in the best physiological parameter and egg production performance of laying hen.
effect of dietary supplementation with resveratrol on nutrient digestibility, methanogenesis and ruminal microbial flora in sheep.
two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on methanogenesis and microbial flora in dorper x thin-tailed han cross-bred ewes. in experiment 1, ten ewes (67.2 +/- 2.24 kg bw) were assigned to two dietary treatments, a basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with resveratrol (0.25 g/head.day), to investigate the effect of resveratrol on nutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance. in experiment 2, six ewes (64.0 +/- 1.85 kg bw) with ruminal cannulae were assigned to the identical dietary treatments used in experiment 1 to investigate supplementary resveratrol on ruminal fermentation and microbial flora using qpcr. the results showed that supplementary resveratrol improved the digestibility of organic matter (om; p < 0.001), nitrogen (n; p = 0.007), neutral detergent fibre (ndf; p < 0.001) and acid detergent fibre (adf; p < 0.001). the excretion of faecal n was reduced (p = 0.007), whereas that of urinary n increased (p = 0.002), which led to an unchanged n retention (p = 0.157). both co2 and ch4 output scaled to digestible dry matter (dm) intake decreased from 602.5 to 518.7 (p = 0.039) and 68.2 to 56.6 (p < 0.001) respectively. ruminal ph (p = 0.341), ammonia (p = 0.512) and total volatile fatty acid (vfa) (p = 0.249) were unaffected by resveratrol. the molar proportion of propionate increased from 13.1 to 17.5% (p < 0.001) while that of butyrate decreased from 11.0 to 9.55% (p < 0.001). the ratio of acetate to propionate (a/p) decreased from 5.44 to 3.96 (p < 0.001). supplementary resveratrol increased ruminal population of fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (p < 0.001) while decreased protozoa and methanogens. in conclusion, dietary resveratrol inhibited methanogenesis without adversely affecting ruminal fermentation.
influence of yeast fermented cassava chip protein (yefecap) and roughage to concentrate ratio on ruminal fermentation and microorganisms using in vitro gas production technique.
the objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein sources and roughage (r) to concentrate (c) ratio on in vitro fermentation parameters using a gas production technique. the experimental design was a 2x5 factorial arrangement in a completely randomized design (crd). factor a was 2 levels of protein sources yeast fermented cassava chip protein (yefecap) and soybean meal (sbm) and factor b was 5 levels of roughage to concentrate (r:c) ratio at 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, and 0:100, respectively. rice straw was used as a roughage source. it was found that gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) of yefecap supplemented group was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in sbm supplemented group. moreover, the intercept value (a), gas production from the insoluble fraction (b), gas production rate constants for the insoluble fraction (c), potential extent of gas production (a+b) and cumulative gas production at 96 h were influenced (p<0.01) by r:c ratio. in addition, protein source had no effect (p>0.05) on ether in vitro digestibility of dry matter (ivdmd) and organic (ivomd) while r:c ratio affected the ivdmd and ivomd (p<0.01). moreover, yefecap supplanted group showed a significantly increased (p<0.05) total vfa and c3 while c2, c2:c3 and ch4 production were decreased when compared with sbm supplemented group. in addition, a decreasing r:c ratio had a significant effect (p<0.05) on increasing total vfa, c3 and nh3-n, but decreasing the c2, c2:c3 and ch4 production (p<0.01). furthermore, total bacteria, fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens and ruminococcus albus populations in yefecap supplemented group were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in the sbm supplemented group while fungal zoospores, methanogens and protozoal population remained unchanged (p>0.05) as compared between the two sources of protein. moreover, fungal zoospores and total bacteria population were significantly increased (p<0.01) while, f. succinogenes, r. flavefaciens, r. albus, methanogens and protozoal population were decreased (p<0.01) with decreasing r:c ratio. in conclusion, yefecap has a potential for use as a protein source for improving rumen fermentation efficiency in ruminants.
albusin b, mass-produced by the saccharomyces cerevisiae suppression system, enhances lipid utilisation and antioxidant capacity in mice.
background: albusin b (bacteriocin), isolated from ruminococcus albus 7 and mass-produced by the saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system, has previously been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism in broiler chickens. the present study was focused on the effect of albusin b on lipid metabolism in mice and the potential of albusin b-expressing yeast product (albusin b) as a food supplement. forty-five balb/c male mice at 6 weeks of age were each orally administered normal saline (control), yeast (0.125 mg kg(-1) ) or albusin b (0.125 mg kg(-1) ) for 14 days and then euthanised. results: compared with the control group, albusin b-fed mice exhibited decreased body weight and plasma levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids but increased plasma high-density lipoprotein. albusin b-fed mice showed higher mrna expression of fatty acid oxidation in the ileum, heart and liver than control mice. compared with the control treatment, both yeast and albusin b treatments caused a decrease in mrna expression of fatty acid synthesis in the heart and liver. moreover, albusin b suppressed mrna levels of lipogenesis in the ileum and liver. albusin b-fed mice exhibited more favourable adenosine triphosphate production and antioxidant capacity in the heart and liver. albusin b treatment led to a significantly lower respiratory quotient than that of the control, whereas yeast treatment did not. conclusion: this study demonstrated a beneficial effect of albusin b on lipid utilisation and anti-atherosclerotic and antioxidant capacities in mice. however, more comprehensive studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism behind the effect of albusin b.
microbial ecosystem and fermentation traits in the caecum of growing rabbits given diets varying in neutral detergent soluble and insoluble fibre levels.
the effect of the level of neutral detergent fibre (ndf: 0.35, li and 0.42, hi) and neutral detergent soluble fibre (ndsf: 0.14, ls and 0.17, hs) in the caecal ecosystem was studied in 24 weaned (28 days of age) rabbits, weighing 630 +/- 80.2 g in a 2 x 2 factorial design. after 22 days, rabbits were slaughtered and their caecal contents sampled. the caecal ph (on average 6.2) and molar volatile fatty acids (vfa) proportions were not affected by dietary treatments, but total vfa concentration tended to be lower with ndf (84.7 vs. 74.1 mmol/l; p = 0.095). the amount of total bacteria tended (p = 0.075) to increase with ndsf, but only in diets with 0.35 ndf. the caecal proportions of ruminococcus albus and fibrobacter succinogenes were not affected by type or level of fibre, but butyrivibrio fibrisolvens decreased (p = 0.055) with the ndf proportion in ls diets. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis showed that bacterial communities clustered according to each combination of ndf and ndsf, but did not greatly differ among diets (similarity indexes between 0.67 and 0.70), nor biodiversity was affected (average shannon and richness indexes 3.50 and 33.1; p > 0.10). archaeal population revealed changes in the amount and composition that were particularly evident in hs diets, decreasing in concentration (from 4.37 to 4.12 log10 gene copy number/g) and biodiversity (shannon index from 3.14 to 2.52 and richness index from 23.7 to 13.9) compared to ls. the type and level of dietary fibre had a minor impact on caecal fermentation traits or caecal bacterial community. however, the increase in ndsf from 0.14 to 0.17 reduced concentration and diversity of methanogenic archaea.
albusin b modulates lipid metabolism and increases antioxidant defense in broiler chickens by a proteomic approach.
background: the present study was designed to investigate the effect of albusin b on lipid metabolism and antioxidant defense in broiler chickens by a proteomic approach. the bacteriocin, albusin b of ruminococcus albus 7, expressed by yeast was applied in this study. three dietary treatments, consisting of the basal diet (control), basal diet + albusin b (2.5 g kg(-)(1)), and basal diet + nosiheptide (2.5 mg kg(-)(1)) were randomly fed to 90 broiler chickens from 1 to 35 days of age, respectively. after 35 days of supplementation, the growth performance, lipid metabolism and antioxidant proteins in the jejunum and liver, intestinal protein profile, and plasma lipid profile were analyzed. results: broilers with albusin b supplementation had greater body weight than the control broilers. compared with the control broilers, lower triglyceride and higher high-density lipoprotein concentration in the blood were observed in both broilers with albusin b and nosiheptide supplementation. in addition, albusin b suppressed the mrna expression of fatty acid binding protein 2 and atp binding cassette transporter g 5 in the jejunum. in the jejunal protein profiles, four antioxidant proteins were upregulated by albusin b and nosiheptide treatments. the jejunal antioxidant gene expression had a concordant pattern. hepatic genes related to lipid metabolism, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coa reductase, and superoxide dismutase were upregulated by albusin b supplementation. conclusion: albusin b supplementation modulated lipid metabolism and activated systemic antioxidant defense, which might partially contribute to the performance of broiler chickens.
enzymatic characteristics of cellobiose phosphorylase from ruminococcus albus ne1 and kinetic mechanism of unusual substrate inhibition in reverse phosphorolysis.
cellobiose phosphorylase (cbp) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of cellobiose to produce alpha-d-glucopyranosyl phosphate (glc1p) and d-glucose. it is an essential enzyme for the metabolism of cello-oligosaccharides in a ruminal bacterium, ruminococcus albus. in this study, recombinant r. albus cbp (racbp) produced in escherichia coli was characterized. it showed highest activity at ph 6.2 at 50 degrees c, and was stable in a ph range of 5.5-8.8 and at below 40 degrees c. it phosphorolyzed only cellobiose efficiently, and the reaction proceeded through a random-ordered bi bi mechanism, by which inorganic phosphate and cellobiose bind in random order and d-glucose is released before glc1p. in the synthetic reaction, racbp showed highest activity to d-glucose, followed by 6-deoxy-d-glucose. d-mannose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, d-glucosamine, d-xylose, 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol, and gentiobiose also served as acceptors, although the activities for them were much lower than for d-glucose. d-glucose acted as a competitive-uncompetitive inhibitor of the reverse synthetic reaction, which bound not only the glc1p site (competitive) but also the ternary enzyme-glc1p-d-glucose complex (uncompetitive).
production and characterization of a bacteriocin from ruminal bacterium ruminococcus albus 7.
the characteristics of a bacteriocin from ruminococcus albus 7 and its potential  as an antibiotic alternative were examined in this study. the addition of 3 microm 3-phenylpropanoic acid (ppa) and 0.2% tween 80 to the culturing medium improved bacteriocin production by 2.5-fold. native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the antagonistically active gel filtration fraction established that the molecular weight of the r. albus 7 bacteriocin was approximately 36 kda. the bacteriocin was sensitive to pepsin, protease, and pancreatin, and was inactivated by heating at 65 degrees c for 1 h. simulating in vitro avian digestion decreased the antagonistic activity by 74.7%, but the addition of 1% bovin serum albumin restored 13% of the lost antagonistic activity. following ion-exchange purification, the bacteriocin had sufficient antagonistic activity against five tested pathogenic strains, but the addition of a protectant is necessary for utilization of bacteriocin of r. albus 7 as an antibiotic alternative in animal feed.
effects of chestnut tannins and coconut oil on growth performance, methane emission, ruminal fermentation, and microbial populations in sheep.
this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of chestnut tannins (ct) and coconut oil (co) on growth performance, methane (ch(4)) emission, ruminal fermentation, and microbial populations in sheep. a total of 48 rideau arcott sheep (average body weight 31.5+/-1.97 kg, 16 wk old) were randomly assigned into 6 treatment groups in a 3 x 2 factorial design, with ct and co as the main effects (8 sheep per group). the treatments were control diet (ctr), 10 or 30 g of ct/kg of diet (ct10 and ct30), 25 g of co/kg of concentrate (co25), and 10 or 30 g of ct/kg of diet+25 g of co/kg of concentrate (ct10co25 and ct30co25). after the feeding trial (60 d), all sheep were moved to respiratory chambers to measure ch(4) emission. after ch(4) emission measurements, all sheep were slaughtered to obtain rumen fluid samples. results showed that the addition of ct, co, and ct+co had no significant effects on growth performance of sheep but reduced ch(4) emission. addition of ct reduced the nh(3)-n concentration in rumen fluid in ct30. addition of co decreased the concentration of total volatile fatty acids in rumen fluid. no significant differences were observed in ph and molar proportion of volatile fatty acids among treatments. addition of ct, co, and ct+co significantly decreased methanogen and protozoa populations. moreover, co decreased counts of fibrobacter succinogenes. no significant differences were observed in populations of fungi, ruminococcus flavefaciens, or ruminococcus albus among treatments. in conclusion, supplementation of ct and co seemed to be a feasible means of decreasing emissions of ch(4) from sheep by reduction of methanogen and protozoa populations with no negative effect on growth performance.
effects of albusin b (a bacteriocin) of ruminococcus albus 7 expressed by yeast on growth performance and intestinal absorption of broiler chickens--its potential role as an alternative to feed antibiotics.
background: bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity are considered as potential  alternatives to antibiotics. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of albusin b (bacteriocin) of ruminococcus albus 7 expressed by yeast on the growth performance of broiler chickens. ninety 1-day-old healthy broiler chickens were randomly divided into three groups: control, albusin b (2.5 g kg(-1)) and nosiheptide (2.5 mg kg(-1), antibiotic control). growth performance and intestinal functions were measured at 5 weeks of age. results: albusin b-supplemented broilers showed increased body weight gain compared with control broilers (54.7 +/- 5.3 vs 48.5 +/- 6.1 g day(-1) per bird, p < 0.05). broilers supplemented with nosiheptide had a less developed mucosal layer than broilers in the other two groups. compared with the control group, broilers supplemented with albusin b or nosiheptide showed increased mrna expression of sglt1, glut2 and pept1 in the jejunum (p < 0.05). the faecal lactobacillus count was higher in the albusin b group than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). conclusion: albusin b supplementation increased intestinal absorption and elevated the faecal lactobacillus count, thereby promoting the growth performance of broiler chickens. these improvements resulting from albusin b supplementation provide evidence of potential alternatives to antibiotics in broiler chicken feed.
influence of the maize silage to grass silage ratio and feed particle size of rations for ruminants on the community structure of ruminal firmicutes in vitro.
aims: to investigate the effect of the forage source and feed particle size (fps) in ruminant rations on the composition of the ruminal firmicutes community in vitro. methods and results: three diets, varying in maize silage to grass silage ratio and fps, were incubated in a rumen simulation system. microbial samples were taken from the liquid fermenter effluents. microbial community analysis was performed by 16s rrna-based techniques. clostridia-specific single-strand conformation polymorphism profiles revealed changes of the community structure in dependence on both factors tested. the coarse grass silage-containing diets seemed to enhance the occurrence of different roseburia species. as detected by real-time quantitative pcr, ruminococcus albus showed a higher abundance with decreasing fps. a slightly lower proportion of bacilli was found with increasing grass silage to maize silage ratio by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). in contrast, a slightly higher proportion of bacterial species belonging to the clostridium-clusters xiv a and b was detected by fish with increasing grass silage contents in the diet. conclusions: the ruminal firmicutes community is affected by the choice of the forage source and fps. significance and impact of the study: this study supplies fundamental knowledge about the response of ruminal microbial communities to changing diets. moreover, the data suggest a standardization of grinding of feeds for in vitro studies to facilitate the comparison of results of different laboratories.
soybean oil and linseed oil supplementation affect profiles of ruminal microorganisms in dairy cows.
the objective of this study was to evaluate changes in ruminal microorganisms and fermentation parameters due to dietary supplementation of soybean and linseed oil alone or in combination. four dietary treatments were tested in a latin square designed experiment using four primiparous rumen-cannulated dairy cows. treatments were control (c, 60 : 40 forage to concentrate) or c with 4% soybean oil (s), 4% linseed oil (l) or 2% soybean oil plus 2% linseed oil (sl) in a 4 x 4 latin square with four periods of 21 days. forage and concentrate mixtures were fed at 0800 and 2000 h daily. ruminal fluid was collected every 2 h over a 12-h period on day 19 of each experimental period and ph was measured immediately. samples were prepared for analyses of concentrations of volatile fatty acids (vfa) by glc and ammonia. counts of total and individual bacterial groups (cellulolytic, proteolytic, amylolytic bacteria and total viable bacteria) were performed using the roll-tube technique, and protozoa counts were measured via microscopy in ruminal fluid collected at 0, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding. content of ruminal digesta was obtained via the rumen cannula before the morning feeding and used immediately for dna extraction and quantity of specific bacterial species was obtained using real- time pcr. ruminal ph did not differ but total vfa (110 v. 105 mmol/l) were lower (p < 0.05) with oil supplementation compared with c. concentration of ruminal nh3-n (4.4 v. 5.6 mmol/l) was greater (p < 0.05) due to oil compared with c. compared with c, oil supplementation resulted in lower (p < 0.05) cellulolytic bacteria (3.25 x 108 v. 4.66 x 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml) and protozoa (9.04 x 104 v. 12.92 x 104 cell/ml) colony counts. proteolytic bacteria (7.01 x 108 v. 6.08 x 108 cfu/ml) counts, however, were greater in response to oil compared with c (p < 0.05). among oil treatments, the amount of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes and ruminococcus flavefaciens in ruminal fluid was substantially lower (p < 0.05) when l was included. compared to c, the amount of ruminococcus albus decreased by an average of 40% regardless of oil level or type. overall, the results indicate that some ruminal microorganisms, except proteolytic bacteria, are highly susceptible to dietary unsaturated fatty acids supplementation, particularly when linolenic acid rich oils were fed. dietary oil effects on ruminal fermentation parameters seemed associated with the profile of ruminal microorganisms.
albusin b, a bacteriocin from the ruminal bacterium ruminococcus albus 7 that inhibits growth of ruminococcus flavefaciens.
an approximately 32-kda protein (albusin b) that inhibited growth of ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1 was isolated from culture supernatants of ruminococcus albus 7. traditional cloning and gene-walking pcr techniques revealed an open reading frame (albb) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32,168 da. a blast search revealed two homologs of albb from the unfinished genome of r. albus 8 and moderate similarity to llpa, a recently described 30-kda bacteriocin from pseudomonas sp. strain bw11m1.
effects of the fusarium spp. mycotoxins fusaric acid and deoxynivalenol on the growth of ruminococcus albus and methanobrevibacter ruminantium.
the fusarium spp. mycotoxins fusaric acid and deoxynivalenol (don) were tested for antimicrobial activity against ruminococcus albus and methanobrevibacter ruminantium. the growth of both organisms was inhibited by fusaric acid as low as 15 micrograms/ml (84 microm) but not by don, at levels as high as 100 micrograms/ml (338 microm). no synergistic inhibitory effect was observed with don plus fusaric acid. neither organism was able to adapt to the fusaric acid and responses of each organism to the compound were different. the optical density (od) maximum for r. albus, but not for m. ruminantium, was diminished after 28 days incubation at concentrations of fusaric acid below 240 micrograms/ml. inhibition of r. albus started before significant growth had occurred, while m. ruminantium doubled twice before the onset of inhibition. responses to picolinic acid, an analog of fusaric acid, were also dramatically different between the two microorganisms with m. ruminantium exhibiting a severe lag followed by a complete recovery of growth, while r. albus was only slightly inhibited with no lag. these results suggest that the mechanism of fusaric acid inhibition is specific to each microorganism. this is the first demonstration of the common mycotoxin fusaric acid inhibiting the growth of rumen bacteria.
competition between ruminal cellulolytic bacteria for adhesion to cellulose.
competition for adhesion to cellulose among the three main ruminal cellulolytic bacterial species was studied using differential radiolabeling (14c/3h) of cells. when added simultaneously to cellulose, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd1 and fibrobacter succinogenes s85 showed some competition; however, both species were surpassed competitively by ruminococcus albus 20. when r. flavefaciens fd1 and f. succinogenes s85 were already adherent, r. albus 20 adhesion occurred without inhibition but involved r. flavefaciens fd1 detachment.
the use of 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes to study competition between  ruminal fibrolytic bacteria: pure-culture studies with cellulose and alkaline peroxide-treated wheat straw.
specific oligonucleotide probes targeted to sites on the 16s rrna of ruminococcus albus 8, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, and fibrobacter succinogenes s85 and a domain bacteria probe were used to study bacterial interactions during the fermentation of cellulose and alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw in monocultures, dicultures, and tricultures. results showed that r. albus 8 inhibited the growth of r. flavefaciens fd-1 when grown as a diculture with cellulose or alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw as the carbon source. in dicultures containing r. albus 8 and f. succinogenes s85 grown on cellulose or alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw, competition was not detected. r. flavefaciens fd-1 outcompeted f. succinogenes s85 when cellulose was used as the carbon source. in tricultures with cellulose as the carbon source, r. flavefaciens fd-1 was inhibited, r. albus 8 appeared to dominate during the early phase of degradation (12 to 48 h), while f. succinogenes s85 became predominant during the later phase of degradation (60 to 70 h). when alkaline hydrogen peroxide-treated wheat straw was used as a growth substrate, f. succinogenes s85 showed better growth than either r. albus 8 or r. flavefaciens fd-1. however, r. flavefaciens fd-1 was present in small numbers throughout the incubation period, unlike the growth patterns when cellulose was the carbon source.
the use of 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes to study competition between  ruminal fibrolytic bacteria: development of probes for ruminococcus species and evidence for bacteriocin production.
a total of six oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the 16s rrna, were evaluated for quantitative and determinative studies of ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens. on the basis of specificity studies, probes for r. albus (probe ral196) and r. flavefaciens (probe rfl196) were selected to quantitate these species in mixed culture. in combination with a fibrobacter succinogenes s85 subspecies probe (sub1) and a domain bacteria (formerly kingdom eubacteria) probe (eub338), they were used to quantitate these species competing in mixed cultures for cellobiose as the carbon source. in dicultures containing r. albus 8 and f. succinogenes s85, competition was not observed. however, r. flavefaciens fd-1 eventually outcompeted f. succinogenes s85 when cellobiose was the substrate. when r. albus 8 and r. flavefaciens fd-1 were grown together on cellobiose medium, r. albus 8 outcompeted r. flavefaciens fd-1, resulting in undetectable r. flavefaciens 16s rrna only 1 to 3 h after inoculation, suggesting production of an antagonistic compound by r. albus 8 during rapid growth on soluble substrates. further, when r. albus 8, r. flavefaciens fd-1, and f. succinogenes s85 were grown together in a triculture, r. flavefaciens fd-1 16s rrna was detectable for only 2 h after inoculation, while r. albus 8 and f. succinogenes s85 showed a similar competition pattern to that of the dicultures. the results show that the ruminococcus probes were effective in the measurement of relative populations of selected r. albus and r. flavefaciens strains during in vitro competition studies with f. succinogenes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
pentose utilization by the ruminal bacterium ruminococcus albus.
ruminococcus albus is an important fibrolytic ruminal bacteria which degrades hemicellulose and ferments the resulting pentose sugars. however, little information is available on the utilization of pentoses by this organism or the effect of hexose sugars on pentose metabolism. enzymatic studies indicated that r. albus metabolized pentoses via the pentose phosphate pathway and possessed constitutive transketolase activity. cellobiose was preferred over xylose and arabinose, and it appeared that the disaccharide decreased pentose metabolism by repression of transport activity and catabolic enzymes (isomerases and kinases). glucose and xylose were co-utilized, and transport studies suggested that there was a common transport system for both sugars. in contrast, glucose was preferred over arabinose and the hexose noncompetitively inhibited the transport of arabinose. since r. albus lacks a glucose phosphotransferase system, the inhibition of arabinose uptake could not be explained by previously described models of inducer exclusion involving such a system. because accumulation of radiolabeled xylose, arabinose, and glucose proceeded in the absence of a proton motive force and since transport was correlated with the intracellular atp concentration, it appeared that monosaccharide uptake was driven by atp hydrolysis.
cellobiose versus glucose utilization by the ruminal bacterium ruminococcus albus.
cellulose degradation and metabolism in the rumen can be adversely affected by the presence of soluble sugars, but relatively little information is available on substrate preferences of cellulolytic bacteria. when the ruminal bacterium ruminococcus albus was incubated with a combination of cellobiose and glucose, the organism preferentially utilized the disaccharide. this preference appeared to be related to repression of glucose uptake systems in cellobiose-grown cells. glucose transport kinetics exhibited low- and high-affinity uptake, and high-affinity transport was apparently driven by atp hydrolysis. bacterial yield in continuous culture was as much as 38% greater when the organism was grown on cellobiose versus glucose, and the increased yield could be partially attributed to constitutive cellobiose phosphorylase activity. the maintenance coefficient of glucose-grown cells was significantly greater than that of cells provided with cellobiose (0.225 g of glucose per g of protein per h versus 0.042 g of cellobiose per g of protein per h), and this result suggested that more energy was devoted to glucose uptake. substrate affinities were examined in carbon-excess continuous culture, and affinities for glucose and cellobiose were relatively low (0.97 and 3.16 mm, respectively). although r. albus maintained a proton motive force of approximately 60 mv from ph 6.7 to 5.5, growth ceased below ph 6.0, and this inhibition of growth may have been caused by a depletion of atp at low ph.
analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and extrachromosomal dna content of ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens.
seventeen ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens strains have been screened for naturally occurring antibiotic resistance, as determined by zones of inhibition from antibiotic disks. these strains were also examined for extrachromosomal dna content. all strains screened are resistant to low levels (10-200 micrograms/ml) of streptomycin. in contrast to the previously reported data, we have found that r. flavefaciens c-94 is now susceptible to both kanamycin and tetracycline. however, r. flavefaciens fd-1 is not susceptible to kanamycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 40 micrograms/ml). furthermore, r. albus 8 is resistant to tetracycline (mic = 40 micrograms/ml), and erythromycin (mic = 100 micrograms/ml). six freshly isolated strains showed resistance to tetracycline (35-70 micrograms/ml), and all tetracycline-resistant strains also showed resistance to minocycline. none of these ruminococcus determinants share homology with the streptococcal tetl, tetm, or tetn determinants. all 17 strains were screened for extrachromosomal dna content. nine different techniques for the detection and isolation of extrachromosomal dna were tested. however, owing to difficulties in demonstrating or isolating plasmid dna, it has not been possible to determine if these antibiotic resistance genes are plasmid borne. evidence is presented to suggest that the presence of oxygen may affect the quality of the dna obtained from ruminococcus.
intergeneric protoplast fusion between ruminococcus albus and an anaerobic recombinant, fe7.
intergeneric protoplast fusion between ruminococcus albus, a cellulolytic, gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium (pc sm km), and an anaerobic recombinant, fe7 (pc sm km), having lignin-related compound-degrading activities, was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions to introduce cellulase genes into strain fe7. the fusion frequency varied with different selected markers from 3.0 x 10 to 3.3 x 10. two fusants, obtained from a synthetic medium with selective pressures of penicillin and streptomycin and with cellooli-gomer as the sole carbon source, were gram-negative rods. one of them, named fe7r2, showed 45 to 47% of the beta-glucosidase and cellobiosidase activities of its parent r. albus and still maintained a level of degradation activity against dehydrodivanillin, a lignin-related compound, of up to 87% of that of the parent strain fe7. to verify that the cellulolytic activities expressed in the fusant fe7r2 originated from r. albus cellulase genes, the beta-glucosidase gene of r. albus was cloned into escherichia coli hb101 with plasmid pbr322. cells bearing a recombinant plasmid, praii, produced high enzyme activities against both p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside and could degrade cellobiose to glucose. southern blot results showed that the cloned dna fragment could hybridize with chromosomal dnas of both r. albus and fe7r2, but did not with the chromosomal dna of fe7, indicating that the beta-glucosidase gene fragment was introduced into the chromosome of fe7r2 from r. albus via the protoplast fusion. the fusant fe7r2 could utilize simultaneously both cellobiose and dehydrodivanillin. these results gave evidence that the fusion product fe7r2 is a recombinant strain between its parents r. albus and fe7. this recombinant has stably kept the above properties for about 2 years.
influence of forage phenolics on ruminal fibrolytic bacteria and in vitro fiber degradation.
in vitro cultures of ruminal microorganisms were used to determine the effect of  cinnamic acid and vanillin on the digestibility of cellulose and xylan. cinnamic acid and vanillin depressed in vitro dry matter disappearance of cellulose 14 and 49%, respectively, when rumen fluid was the inoculum. the number of viable bacteroides succinogenes cells, the predominant cellulolytic organism, was threefold higher for fermentations which contained vanillin than for control fermentations. when xylan replaced cellulose as the substrate, a 14% decrease in the digestibility of xylan was observed with vanillin added; however, the number of viable xylanolytic bacteria cultured from the batch fermentation was 10-fold greater than that of control fermentations. the doubling time of b. succinogenes was increased from 2.32 to 2.58 h when vanillin was added to cellobiose medium, and absorbance was one-half that of controls after 18 h. the growth rate of ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens was inhibited more by p-coumaric acid than by vanillin, although no reduction of final absorbance was observed in their growth cycles. vanillin, and to a lesser extent cinnamic acid, appeared to prevent the attachment of b. succinogenes cells to cellulose particles, but did not affect dissociation of cells from the particles. b. succinogenes, r. albus, r. flavefaciens, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens all modified the parent monomers cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and vanillin, with b. fibrisolvens causing the most extensive modification. these results suggest that phenolic monomers can inhibit digestibility of cellulose and xylan, possibly by influencing attachment of the fibrolytic microorganisms to fiber particles. the reduced bacterial attachment to structural carbohydrates in the presence of vanillin may generate more free-floating fibrolytic organisms, thus giving a deceptively higher viable count.
antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
a metabolite of trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. to standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using escherichia coli atcc 11775. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees c was generally less than 10 micrograms x ml-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for megasphaera elsdenii b159 and streptococcus bovis pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. in general, the gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the gram positive. the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms x ml-1; for b. ruminicola ga33 (glucose), b. succinogenes s85 (cellobiose), and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram x ml-1. when added to a cellulose-containing rumen fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms x ml-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by b. succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, and r. flavefaciens fd1 for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms x ml-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. in the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
effect of soluble carbohydrates on digestion of cellulose by pure cultures of rumen bacteria.
the rate of cellulose digestion in the presence of either glucose or cellobiose was studied for the three predominant species of cellulolytic rumen bacteria: ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and bacteroides succinogenes. when a soluble carbohydrate was added to cellulose broth, the lag phase of cellulose digestion was shortened. presumably, this was due to greater numbers of bacteria, because increasing the size of the inoculum had a similar effect. cellulose digestion occurred simultaneously with utilization of the soluble carbohydrate. the rate of cellulose digestion slowed markedly for b. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens and slowed less for r. albus after the cellobiose or glucose had been utilized, and was accompanied by a decrease in ph. both the rate and the extent of cellulose digestion were partially inhibited when the initial ph of the medium was 6.3 or below. r. albus appeared to be less affected by a low-ph medium than were b. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens. when a soluble carbohydrate was added to the fermentation during the maximum-rate phase of cellulose digestion, the rate of cellulose digestion was not affected until after the soluble carbohydrate had been depleted and the ph had decreased markedly. prolonged exposure of the bacteria to a low ph had little if any effect on their subsequent ability to digest cellulose. cellulase activity of intact bacterial cells appeared to be constitutive in nature for these three species of rumen bacteria.
molybdate and sulfide inhibit h2 and increase formate production from glucose by  ruminococcus albus.
h2 production from glucose by ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) m molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. the results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form h2 are used to reduce co2 to formate. growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) m. reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of h2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) m molybdate. h2 production by r. bromei but not by r. flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, veillonella alcalescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.
effect of monensin and lasalocid-sodium on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria.
it is thought that monensin increases the efficiency of feed utilization by cattle by altering the rumen fermentation. we studied the effect of monensin and the related ionophore antibiotic lasalocid-sodium (hoffman-laroche) on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria in a complex medium containing rumen fluid. ruminococcus albus, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were inhibited by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. growth of bacteroides succinogenes and bacteroides ruminicola was delayed by 2.5 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. populations of b. succinogenes and b. ruminicola that were resistant to 20 mug of either drug per ml were rapidly selected by growth in the presence of each drug at 5.0 mug/ml. selenomonas ruminantium was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or lasalocid per ml. either antibiotic (10 mug/ml) inhibited methanobacterium moh, methanobacterium formicicum, and methanosarcina barkeri ms. methanobacterium ruminantium ps was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin or 20 mug of lasalocid per ml. the methanogenic strain 442 was insensitive to 40 mug of monensin but sensitive to 10 mug of lasalocid per ml. the results suggest that monensin or lasalocid acts in the rumen by selecting for succinate-forming bacteroides and for s. ruminantium, a propionate producer that decarboxylates succinate to propionate. the selection could lead to an increase in rumen propionate formation. selection against h(2) and formate producers, e.g. r. albus, r. flavefaciens, and b. fibrisolvens, could lead to a depression of methane production in the rumen.
cellulase from ruminococcus albus and mixed rumen microorganisms.
cellulase in the cultural filtrates of ruminococcus albus and cellulase extracted from mixed rumen microorganisms were investigated with acid-swollen cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose as substrates. maximal activity occurred at approximately ph 5.8 and 47 c. apparent michaelis constants (k(m)) varied between 0.53 and 0.02% carboxymethylcellulose, depending on the level of activity and the method of assay. r. albus cellulase has a lower k(m) value than the enzyme extracted from mixed rumen microorganisms. antisera from rabbits immunized with a cellulase preparation from r. albus inhibited the cellulolytic activity of both systems. based on the relative degree of inhibition, approximately 20% of the cellulase of the mixed rumen microorganisms was immunologically similar to r. albus cellulase. ratios of activity in different assay techniques showed the two sources of activity to be similar in the mechanisms of degradation. however, glucose is the main product of cellulose degradation by mixed rumen microorganisms, and cellobiose is the product of degradation by r. albus.
