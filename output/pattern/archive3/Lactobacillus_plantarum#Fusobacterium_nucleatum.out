antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain, alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.
lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
similar to streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. for lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at phs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate. for f. nucleatum suspended at ph 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/l bicarbonate activation. when lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, ph 5.3, lysis was observed only with l. plantarum and s. mutans, but not with l. casei. the latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. in experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for l. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to salivary factors other than lysozyme. f. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral ph, suggesting that both gram-positive and gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.
