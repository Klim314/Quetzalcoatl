TI == dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa to enoyl-coa in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB == several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa, which is dehydrated to enoyl-coa by syn-elimination. this reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pk 40-50). a mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component a, an activator, and component d, the actual dehydratase. component a, a homodimer with one [4fe-4s]cluster, transfers an electron to component d, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4fe-4s]clusters and fmn, concomitant with hydrolysis of two atp. from component d the electron is further transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. in the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pk14). after elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of atp. the helix-cluster-helix architecture of component a forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of atp resembling an archer shooting arrows. therefore we designated component a as 'archerase'. here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans, clostridium symbiosum and fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium difficile, and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. a relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases is benzoyl-coa reductase from thauera aromatica. analogous but unrelated archerases are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. in anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven electron transfer from nadh to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component a, has been established. the transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical na(+)-gradient. this enzyme is related to the rnf proteins involved in rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.

TI == 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum.
AB == component d (hgdab) of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum was purified to homogeneity. it is able to use component a from acidaminococcus fermentans (hgdc) to initiate catalysis together with atp, mg2+ and a strong reducing agent such as ti(iii)citrate. component d from c. symbiosum has a 6 x higher specific activity compared with that from a. fermentans and contains a second [4fe-4s] cluster but the same amount of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (1.0 per heterodimeric enzyme, m = 100 kda). mossbauer spectroscopy revealed symmetric cube-type structures of the two [4fe-4s]2+ clusters. epr spectroscopy showed the resistance of the clusters to reducing agents, but detected a sharp signal at g = 2. 004 probably due to a stabilized flavin semiquinone. three genes from c. symbiosum coding for components d (hgda and hgdb) and a (hgdc) were cloned and sequenced. primer extension experiments indicated that the genes are transcribed in the order hgdcab from an operon only half the size of that from a. fermentans. sequence comparisons detected a close relationship to the dehydratase system from a. fermentans and hgda from fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as to putative proteins of unknown function from archaeoglobus fulgidus. lower, but significant, identities were found with putative enzymes from several methanogenic archaea and escherichia coli, as well as with the mechanistically related benzoyl-coa reductases from the proteobacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris and thauera aromatica.

TI == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI == the biotin-dependent sodium ion pump glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase from fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum). comparison with the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from gram-positive bacteria.
AB == membrane preparations of fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein). the enzyme was solubilized with 2% triton x-100 in 0.5 m nacl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-sepharose. the activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on na+ (km = 3 mm) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria acidaminococcus fermentans and clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent km for na+ (1 mm) and were not stimulated by phospholipids. in addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium ion. by incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic sodium ion pump was reconstituted. the enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kda), beta (33 kda), gamma (19 kda), and delta (16 kda) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). the subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. with an antiserum directed against the decarboxylase from a. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus could be detected on western blots.
