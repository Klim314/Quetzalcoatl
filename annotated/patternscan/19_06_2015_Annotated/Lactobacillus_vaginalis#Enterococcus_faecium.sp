TI  == adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  == in the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with  the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of lactobacillus buchneri 24s8. only lactobacillus mucosae 29s8, enterococcus faecium e21, and e. faecium eac adhered to colonic mucus. probiotic  strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except escherichia coli o8:k88ab:h9 (65), fusobacterium necrophorum, and gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. only kocuria kristinae and g. vaginalis adhered  to uterine body mucus; e. coli o149:k88ac (ec) adhered to colonic mucus. the strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. the ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of gras (generally regarded as safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
