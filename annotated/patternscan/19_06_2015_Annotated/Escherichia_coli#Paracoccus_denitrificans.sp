TI  == proteomic responses to a methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress in the wild type and ferb mutant strains of paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == ferb is a cytoplasmic flavoprotein from the soil bacterium paracoccus denitrificans with a putative role in defense against oxidative stress. to further explore this hypothesis, we compared protein variations upon methyl viologen treatment in wild-type and ferb mutant strains by a quantitative proteomic analysis based on itraq-3dlc-ms/ms analysis. the proteins showing the most prominent increase in abundance were assigned to carbon fixation and sulfur  assimilatory pathways. by employing these proteins as indirect markers, oxidative stress was found to be 15% less severe in the wild-type than in the ferb-deficient mutant cells. oxidative stress altered the levels of proteins whose expression is dependent on the transcriptional factor fnrp. the observed down-regulation of the fnrp regulon members, most notably that of nitrous oxide reductase, was tentatively explained by an oxidative degradation of the [4fe-4s]  center of fnrp leading to a protein form which no longer activates transcription. while the level of ferb remained relatively constant, two proteins homologous to  ferb accumulated during oxidative stress. when their genes were expressed in escherichia coli, neither of the protein products contained a bound flavin, whereas they both had a high activity of flavin reductase, one preferentially utilizing nadh and the other nadph.

TI  == highly sensitive and specific detection of e. coli by a sers nanobiosensor chip utilizing metallic nanosculptured thin films.
AB  == a nanobiosensor chip, utilizing surface enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers) on nanosculptured thin films (nstfs) of silver, was shown to detect escherichia coli (e. coli) bacteria down to the concentration level of a single bacterium. the sensor utilizes highly enhanced plasmonic nstfs of silver on a silicon platform for the enhancement of raman bands as checked with adsorbed 4-aminothiophenol molecules. t-4 bacteriophages were immobilized on the aforementioned surface of the chip for the specific capture of target e. coli bacteria. to demonstrate that no significant non-specific immobilization of other bacteria occurs, three different, additional bacterial strains, chromobacterium violaceum, paracoccus denitrificans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used. furthermore, experiments performed on an additional strain of e. coli to address the specificity and reusability of the sensor showed that the sensor operates for different strains of e. coli and is reusable. time resolved phase contrast microscopy of the e. coli-t4 bacteriophage chip was performed to study its interaction with bacteria over time. results showed that the present sensor performs a fast, accurate and stable detection of e. coli with ultra-small concentrations of bacteria down to the level of a single bacterium in 10 mul volume of the sample.

TI  == the sole tryptophan of amicyanin enhances its thermal stability but does not influence the electronic properties of the type 1 copper site.
AB  == the cupredoxin amicyanin possesses a single tryptophan residue, trp45. its fluorescence is quenched when copper is bound even though it is separated by 10.1a. mutation of trp45 to ala, phe, leu and lys resulted in undetectable protein expression. a w45y amicyanin variant was isolated. the w45y mutation did  not alter the spectroscopic properties or intrinsic redox potential of amicyanin, but increased the pka value for the ph-dependent redox potential by 0.5 units. this is due to a hydrogen-bond involving the his95 copper ligand which is present in reduced w45y amicyanin but not in native amicyanin. the w45y mutation significantly decreased the thermal stability of amicyanin, as determined by changes in the visible absorbance of oxidized amicyanin and in the circular dichroism spectra for oxidized, reduced and apo forms of amicyanin. comparison of the crystal structures suggests that the decreased stability of w45y amicyanin may be attributed to the loss of a strong interior hydrogen bond between trp45 and tyr90 in native amicyanin which links two of the beta-sheets that comprise the overall structure of amicyanin. thus, trp45 is critical for stabilizing the structure of amicyanin but it does not influence the electronic properties of the copper which quenches its fluorescence.

TI  == identification and characterization of the 'missing' terminal enzyme for siroheme biosynthesis in alpha-proteobacteria.
AB  == it has recently been shown that the biosynthetic route for both the d1 -haem cofactor of dissimilatory cd1 nitrite reductases and haem, via the novel alternative-haem-synthesis pathway, involves siroheme as an intermediate, which was previously thought to occur only as a cofactor in assimilatory sulphite/nitrite reductases. in many denitrifiers (which require d1 -haem), the pathway to make siroheme remained to be identified. here we identify and characterize a sirohydrochlorin-ferrochelatase from paracoccus pantotrophus that  catalyses the last step of siroheme synthesis. it is encoded by a gene annotated  as cbix that was previously assumed to be encoding a cobaltochelatase, acting on  sirohydrochlorin. expressing this chelatase from a plasmid restored the wild-type phenotype of an escherichia coli mutant-strain lacking sirohydrochlorin-ferrochelatase activity, showing that this chelatase can act in  the in vivo siroheme synthesis. a deltacbix mutant in p. denitrificans was unable to respire anaerobically on nitrate, proving the role of siroheme as a precursor  to another cofactor. we report the 1.9 a crystal structure of this ferrochelatase. in vivo analysis of single amino acid variants of this chelatase  suggests that two histidines, his127 and his187, are essential for siroheme synthesis. this cbix can generally be identified in alpha-proteobacteria as the terminal enzyme of siroheme biosynthesis.

TI  == 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomer hydrolase and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase participate in intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate and polyhydroxyvalerate degradation in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == genes encoding 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomer hydrolase (phazc) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (hbd) were isolated from paracoccus denitrificans. phazc and hbd were overproduced as his-tagged proteins in escherichia coli and purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. purified his-tagged proteins had molecular masses of 31 kda and 120 kda (a tetramer of 29-kda subunits). the his-tagged phazc hydrolyzed not only 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomers but also 3-hydroxyvalerate oligomers. the his-tagged hbd catalyzed the dehydrogenation of  3-hydroxyvalerate as well as 3-hydroxybutyrate. when both enzymes were included in the same enzymatic reaction system with 3-hydroxyvalerate dimer, sequential reactions occurred, suggesting that phazc and hbd play an important role in the intracellular degradation of poly(3-hydroxyvalerate). when the phazc gene was disrupted in p. denitrificans by insertional inactivation, the mutant strain lost phazc activity. when the phazc-disrupted p. denitrificans was complemented with phazc, phazc activity was restored. these results suggest that p. denitrificans carries a single phazc gene. disruption of the phazc gene in p. denitrificans affected the degradation rate of pha.

TI  == hydrogen/hydride ion relay--a mechanism for early electron transfer in cytochrome c oxidases.
AB  == cytochrome c oxidase (cox) employs electrons obtained from cytochrome c to bring  about the reduction of oxygen to water. it is known that the electrons originate  from the haem edge of cytochrome c and enters bovine cox at trp-104. it is also known that tyr-105, glu-198 and asp-158 of cox subunit ii play roles in the enzyme's catalysis but how these roles are linked to electron transfer remain unclear. recently, we proposed that electrons travel from the haem edge of cytochrome c to cua, the first metal redox centre of cox, by a hydrogen/hydride ion relay using six residues. now using a similar computer assisted approach, we  investigate the extent to which this hydride/hydrogen ion mechanism is common amongst oxidases. the crystal structures of cox from p denitrificans, r sphaeroides and t thermophilus and quinol oxidase from e coli were downloaded and their binding domains analysed. as with bovine, all four oxidases had only nine amino acid residues in that region and both the sequences and three-dimensional structures were highly conserved. we propose that these residues function as a hydrogen/hydride ion relay, participating directly in electron transfer to cua. we further suggest that this electron transfer mechanism might be a common feature in oxidases.

TI  == cumate-inducible gene expression system for sphingomonads and other alphaproteobacteria.
AB  == tunable promoters represent a pivotal genetic tool for a wide range of applications. here we present such a system for sphingomonads, a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria that have gained much interest for their potential in bioremediation and their use in industry and for which no dedicated inducible gene expression system has been described so far. a strong, constitutive synthetic promoter was first identified through a genetic screen and subsequently combined with the repressor and the operator sites of the pseudomonas putida f1 cym/cmt system. the resulting promoter, termed pq5, responds rapidly to the inducer cumate and shows a maximal induction ratio of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude  in the different sphingomonads tested. moreover, it was also functional in other  alphaproteobacteria, such as the model organisms caulobacter crescentus, paracoccus denitrificans, and methylobacterium extorquens. in the noninduced state, expression from pq5 is low enough to allow gene depletion analysis, as demonstrated with the essential gene phyp of sphingomonas sp. strain fr1. a set of pq5-based plasmids has been constructed allowing fusions to affinity tags or fluorescent proteins.

TI  == paracoccus denitrificans pd1222 utilizes hypotaurine via transamination followed  by spontaneous desulfination to yield acetaldehyde and, finally, acetate for growth.
AB  == hypotaurine (ht; 2-aminoethane-sulfinate) is known to be utilized by bacteria as  a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for growth, as is taurine (2-aminoethane-sulfonate); however, the corresponding ht degradation pathway has  remained undefined. genome-sequenced paracoccus denitrificans pd1222 utilized ht  (and taurine) quantitatively for heterotrophic growth and released the ht sulfur  as sulfite (and sulfate) and ht nitrogen as ammonium. enzyme assays with cell extracts suggested that an ht-inducible ht:pyruvate aminotransferase (hpa) catalyzes the deamination of ht in an initial reaction step. partial purification of the hpa activity and peptide fingerprinting-mass spectrometry (pf-ms) identified the hpa candidate gene; it encoded an archetypal taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (tpa). the same gene product was identified via differential page and pf-ms, as was the gene of a strongly ht-inducible aldehyde dehydrogenase (adh). both genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli. the overexpressed, purified hpa/tpa showed ht:pyruvate-aminotransferase activity. alanine, acetaldehyde, and sulfite were identified as the reaction products but not sulfinoacetaldehyde; the reaction of hpa/tpa with taurine yielded sulfoacetaldehyde, which is stable. the overexpressed, purified adh oxidized the  acetaldehyde generated during the hpa reaction to acetate in an nad(+)-dependent  reaction. based on these results, the following degradation pathway for ht in strain pd1222 can be depicted. the identified aminotransferase converts ht to sulfinoacetaldehyde, which desulfinates spontaneously to acetaldehyde and sulfite; the inducible aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizes acetaldehyde to yield acetate, which is metabolized, and sulfite, which is excreted.

TI  == group x aldehyde dehydrogenases of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 degrade hydrazones.
AB  == hydrazones are natural and synthetic compounds containing a c=n-n moiety. here we found that the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produced nad(+)- or nadp(+)-dependent hydrazone dehydrogenase (hdh), which converts hydrazones to the corresponding hydrazides and acids rather than to the simple hydrolytic product aldehydes. gene cloning indicated that the hdh is part of the  group x aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh) family, which is distributed among bacteria, although the physiological roles of the aldh family remain unknown. the pao1 strain upregulated hdh in the presence of the hydrazone adipic acid bis(ethylidene hydrazide) (aeh). gene disruption of the hdh-encoding hdha (pa4022) decreased growth rates in culture medium containing aeh as the sole carbon source, and this effect was more obvious in the double gene disruption of  hdha and its orthologous exac (pa1984), indicating that these genes are responsible for hydrazone utilization. recombinant proteins of group x aldhs from escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, and ochrobactrum anthropi also acted  as hdhs in that they produced hdh activity in the cells and degraded hydrazones.  these findings indicated the physiological roles of group x aldhs in bacteria and showed that they comprise a distinct aldh subfamily.

TI  == an unusual subtilisin-like serine protease is essential for biogenesis of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase.
AB  == quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase (qhndh), an alphabetagamma heterotrimer present in the periplasm of several gram-negative bacteria, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of various aliphatic amines such as n-butylamine for assimilation as carbon and energy sources. the gamma subunit of mature qhndh contains a protein-derived quinone cofactor, cysteine tryptophylquinone, and three intrapeptidyl thioether cross-links between cys and asp or glu residues. in its cytoplasmic nascent form, the gamma subunit has a 28-residue n-terminal leader peptide that is necessary for the production of active qhndh but must be removed in the following maturation process. here, we describe the role of a subtilisin-like serine protease encoded in the fifth orf of the n-butylamine-utilizing operon of paracoccus denitrificans (termed orf5) in qhndh  biogenesis. orf5 disruption caused bacterial cell growth inhibition in n-butylamine-containing medium and production of inactive qhndh, in which the gamma subunit retained the leader peptide. supply of plasmid-encoded orf5 restored the cell growth and production of active qhndh, containing the correctly processed gamma subunit. orf5 expressed in escherichia coli but not its catalytic triad mutant cleaved synthetic peptides surrogating for the gamma subunit leader  peptide, although extremely slowly. the cleaved leader peptide remained unstably  bound to orf5, most likely as an acyl enzyme intermediate attached to the active-site ser residue. these results demonstrate that orf5 is essential for qhndh biogenesis, serving as a processing protease to cleave the gamma subunit leader peptide nearly in a disposable manner.

TI  == free energy analysis of omega-transaminase reactions to dissect how the enzyme controls the substrate selectivity.
AB  == omega-transaminase (omega-ta) is the only naturally occurring enzyme allowing asymmetric amination of ketones for production of chiral amines. the active site  of the enzyme was proposed to consist of two differently sized substrate binding  pockets and the stringent steric constraint in the small pocket has presented a significant challenge to production of structurally diverse chiral amines. to provide a mechanistic understanding of how the (s)-specific omega-ta from paracoccus denitrificans achieves the steric constraint in the small pocket, we developed a free energy analysis enabling quantification of individual contributions of binding and catalytic steps to changes in the total activation energy caused by structural differences in the substrate moiety that is to be accommodated by the small pocket. the analysis exploited kinetic and thermodynamic investigations using structurally similar substrates and the structural differences among substrates were regarded as probes to assess how much relative destabilizations of the reaction intermediates, i.e. the michaelis  complex and the transition state, were induced by the slight change of the substrate moiety inside the small pocket. we found that approximately 80% of changes in the total activation energy resulted from changes in the enzyme-substrate binding energy, indicating that substrate selectivity in the small pocket is controlled predominantly by the binding step (k(m)) rather than the catalytic step (k(cat)). in addition, we examined the ph dependence of the kinetic parameters and the ph profiles of the k(m) and k(cat) values suggested that key active site residues involved in the binding and catalytic steps are decoupled. taken together, these findings suggest that the active site residues forming the small pocket are mainly engaged in the binding step but not significantly involved in the catalytic step, which may provide insights into how to design a rational strategy for engineering of the small pocket to relieve the  steric constraint toward bulky substituents.

TI  == revised transmembrane orientation of the nadh:quinone oxidoreductase subunit nuoa.
AB  == nuoa is a small membrane spanning subunit of respiratory chain nadh:quinone oxidoreductase (complex i). unlike the other complex i core protein subunits, the nuoa protein has no known homologue in other enzyme systems. the transmembrane orientation of nuoa cannot be unambiguously predicted, due to the small size of the polypeptide and the varying distribution of charged amino acid residues in nuoa from different organisms. novel analyses of nuoa from escherichia coli complex i expressed as fusion proteins to cytochrome c and to alkaline phosphatase demonstrated that the c-terminal end of the polypeptide is localized  in the bacterial cytoplasm, in contrast to what was previously reported for the homologous nqo7 subunit from paracoccus denitrificans complex i.

TI  == microbial growth at hyperaccelerations up to 403,627 x g.
AB  == it is well known that prokaryotic life can withstand extremes of temperature, ph, pressure, and radiation. little is known about the proliferation of prokaryotic life under conditions of hyperacceleration attributable to extreme gravity, however. we found that living organisms can be surprisingly proliferative during  hyperacceleration. in tests reported here, a variety of microorganisms, including gram-negative escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, and shewanella amazonensis; gram-positive lactobacillus delbrueckii; and eukaryotic saccharomyces cerevisiae, were cultured while being subjected to hyperaccelerative conditions. we observed and quantified robust cellular growth in these cultures across a wide range of hyperacceleration values. most notably,  the organisms p. denitrificans and e. coli were able to proliferate even at 403,627 x g. analysis shows that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for their proliferation under conditions of hyperacceleration. our results indicate that microorganisms cannot only survive during hyperacceleration but can display such robust proliferative behavior that the habitability of extraterrestrial environments must not be limited by gravity.

TI  == characterization of heme-binding properties of paracoccus denitrificans surf1 proteins.
AB  == biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (cox) is a highly complex process involving >30 chaperones in eukaryotes; those required for the incorporation of the copper  and heme cofactors are also conserved in bacteria. surf1, associated with heme a  insertion and with leigh syndrome if defective in humans, is present as two homologs in the soil bacterium paracoccus denitrificans, surf1c and surf1q. in an in vitro interaction assay, the heme a transfer from purified heme a synthase, ctaa, to surf1c was followed, and both surf proteins were tested for their heme a binding properties. mutation of four strictly conserved amino acid residues within the transmembrane part of each surf1 protein confirmed their requirement for heme binding. interestingly the mutation of a tryptophan residue in transmembrane helix ii (w200 in surf1c and w209 in surf1q) led to a drastic switch in the heme composition, with surf1 now being populated mostly by heme o,  the intermediate in the heme a biosynthetic pathway. this tryptophan residue discriminates between the two heme moieties, apparently coordinates the formyl group of heme a, and most likely presents the cofactor in a spatial orientation suitable for optimal transfer to its target site within subunit i of cytochrome c oxidase.

TI  == sodium influence on energy transduction by complexes i from escherichia coli and  paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the nature of the ions that are translocated by escherichia coli and paracoccus denitrificans complexes i was investigated. we observed that e. coli complex i was capable of proton translocation in the same direction to the established deltapsi, showing that in the tested conditions, the coupling ion is the h(+). furthermore, na(+) transport to the opposite direction was also observed, and, although na(+) was not necessary for the catalytic or proton transport activities, its presence increased the latter. we also observed h(+) translocation by p. denitrificans complex i, but in this case, h(+) transport was not influenced by na(+) and also na(+) transport was not observed. we concluded that e. coli complex i has two energy coupling sites (one na(+) independent and the other na(+) dependent), as previously observed for rhodothermus marinus complex i, whereas the coupling mechanism of p. denitrificans enzyme is completely na(+) independent. this work thus shows that complex i energy transduction by proton pumping and na(+)/h(+) antiporting is not exclusive of the r. marinus enzyme. nevertheless, the na(+)/h(+) antiport activity seems not to be a general property of complex i, which may be correlated with the metabolic characteristics of the organisms.

TI  == cell-free synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, a multicomponent membrane protein.

TI  == comparing the substrate specificities of cytochrome c biogenesis systems i and ii: bioenergetics.
AB  == c-type cytochromes require specific post-translational protein systems, which vary in different organisms, for the characteristic covalent attachment of heme to the cytochrome polypeptide. cytochrome c biogenesis system ii, found in chloroplasts and many bacteria, comprises four subunits, two of which (resb and resc) are the minimal functional unit. the ycf5 gene from helicobacter pylori encodes a fusion of resb and resc. heterologous expression of resbc in escherichia coli lacking its own biogenesis machinery allowed us to investigate the substrate specificity of system ii. resbc is able to attach heme to monoheme  c-type cytochromes c(550) from paracoccus denitrificans and c(552) from hydrogenobacter thermophilus, both normally matured by system i. the production of holocytochrome is enhanced by the addition of exogenous reductant. single-cysteine variants of these cytochromes were not efficiently matured by system ii, but system i was able to produce detectable amounts of axxch variants; this adds to evidence that there is no obligate requirement for a disulfide-bonded intermediate for the latter c-type cytochrome biogenesis system. in addition, system ii was able to mature an axxah-containing variant into a b-type cytochrome, with implications for both heme supply to the periplasm and substrate recognition by system ii.

TI  == heterologous expression and molecular characterization of the nad(p)h:acceptor oxidoreductase (ferb) of paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == ferb is a flavoenzyme capable of reducing quinones, ferric complexes and chromate. its expression in escherichia coli as a hexahistidine fusion resulted in a functional product only when the tag was placed on the c-terminus. the molecular mass values estimated by gel permeation chromatography were compatible  with the existence of either dimer or trimer, whereas the light scattering data,  together with cross-linking experiments that yielded exclusively monomer and dimer bands on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, strongly supported a dimeric  nature of both native and tagged form of ferb. these two proteins also exhibited  almost identical secondary structure as judged by fourier transform infra red spectrometry. the presence of tag, however, shifted the temperature of thermal inactivation as well as the thermal denaturation curve towards lower temperatures. despite somewhat lower thermal stability, the fusion protein is considered a better candidate for crystallization than the wild-type one due to a more negative value of its second optical viral coefficient.

TI  == surf1, associated with leigh syndrome in humans, is a heme-binding protein in bacterial oxidase biogenesis.
AB  == biogenesis of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (cox) relies on a large number of assembly factors, among them the transmembrane protein surf1. the loss of human surf1 function is associated with leigh syndrome, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by severe cox deficiency. in the bacterium paracoccus denitrificans, two homologous proteins, surf1c and surf1q, were identified, which we characterize in the present study. when coexpressed in escherichia coli together with enzymes for heme a synthesis, the bacterial surf1 proteins bind heme a in vivo. using redox difference spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry, the binding of the heme cofactor to purified apo-surf1c and apo-surf1q is quantified: each of the paracoccus proteins binds heme a in a 1:1 stoichiometry and with kd values in the submicromolar range. in addition, we identify a conserved histidine as a residue crucial for heme binding. contrary to most earlier concepts, these data support a direct role of surf1 in heme a cofactor insertion into cox subunit i by providing a protein-bound heme a pool.

TI  == molecular mimicry in innate immunity: crystal structure of a bacterial tir domain.
AB  == macrophages detect pathogen infection via the activation of their plasma membrane-bound toll-like receptor proteins (tlrs). the heterotypic interaction between the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (tir) domains of tlrs and adaptor proteins, like myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (myd88), is the first intracellular step in the signaling pathway of the mammalian innate immune  response. the hetero-oligomerization of the tirs of the receptor and adaptor brings about the activation of the transcription factor nf-kappab, which regulates the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. here, we report the first  crystal structure of a bacterial tir domain solved at 2.5 a resolution. the three-dimensional fold of paracoccus denitrificans tir is identical to that observed for the tir of human tlrs and myd88 proteins. the structure shows a unique dimerization interface involving the dd-loop and ee-loop residues, whereas leaving the bb-loop highly exposed. peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry also reveals that the same region is used for dimerization in solution and in the context of the full-length protein. these results, together with a functional interaction between p. denitrificans tir and myd88 visualized in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, further substantiate the model that bacterial  tir proteins adopt structural mimicry of the host active receptor tir domains to  interfere with the signaling of tlrs and their adaptors to decrease the inflammatory response.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial oxidases by formamide and analogs.
AB  == the enzymatic activity of paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase (cox) and escherichia coli cytochrome b(o) ubiquinol oxidase (qox) was determined in the presence of formamide, n,n-dimethyl formamide and n,n-dimethyl acetamide. formamide was found to inhibit the enzyme activity of the oxidases most significantly, whereas the other two compounds inhibited the activity to a lesser extent. the effects of formamide and analogs on enzyme activity were very similar for cox and qox, indicating that the mechanism of inhibition might be the same for both of these oxidases. the inhibition kinetics followed a non-competitive mechanism. studies using proteoliposomes of cox and qox containing the electron entry site of the enzyme directed towards the outside of the vesicles showed that the effect of inhibition by formamide was higher when the inhibitor was present on the outside of the proteoliposome compared to when it was present only in the  aqueous core. this indicates that inhibition of enzyme activity by formamide possibly predominantly involves blocking of the water exit pathway in the oxidases.

TI  == the role of lipids for the functional integrity of porin: an ftir study using lipid and protein reporter groups.
AB  == we have investigated the temperature-dependent interaction of the porins ompf from paracoccus denitrificans and ompg from escherichia coli with lipid molecules after reconstitution in lecithin. effects of incubation at increased temperatures on activity were tested by functional experiments for ompg and compared with previously published results of ompf in order to understand the activity loss of  ompf with monomerization. protein-lipid interaction was monitored by different reporter groups both from lipid molecules and from protein. ompf loses its activity by approximately 90% at 50 degrees c while ompg does not show a temperature-dependent change in activity between room temperature and 50 degrees  c. the interaction between ompf and lipid molecules is severely altered in a two-step mechanism at 55 and approximately 75 degrees c for ompf. the first step  is attributed to changes in the degree of interaction between the aromatic girdle of ompf and the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer, leading to monomerization of this trimeric porin. the second step at 75 degrees c is attributed to the changes in lipid-porin monomer interaction. around 90 degrees c, reconstituted porin aggregates. for ompg, changes in lipid-protein interaction were observed starting from approximately 80 degrees c because of temperature-induced breakdown of its folding. this study provides deeper understanding of porin-lipid bilayer interaction as a function of temperature and can explain the functional breakdown by monomerization while porin secondary structure is still preserved.

TI  == biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase--in vitro approaches to study cofactor insertion into a bacterial subunit i.
AB  == biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase is a complex process involving more than 30 known accessory proteins in yeast for the regulation of transcription and translation, membrane insertion and protein processing, cofactor insertion, and subunit assembly. here, we focus on the process of cofactor insertion into subunit i of cytochrome c oxidase using the soil bacterium paracoccus denitrificans as a model organism. the use of bacterial systems facilitates biogenesis studies, as the number of required assembly factors is reduced to a minimum. both, co- and posttranslational cofactor insertion scenarios are discussed, and several approaches to shed light on this aspect of biogenesis are  presented. ctag, the paracoccus homolog of yeast cox11 which is involved in copper delivery to the cu(b) center, has been purified and characterized spectroscopically. a previously unreported signal at 358 nm allows monitoring copper transfer from copper-loaded ctag to an acceptor. both ctag and apo-subunit i were purified after expression in escherichia coli to develop an in vitro copper transfer system, probing the posttranslational insertion hypothesis. to mimic a potential cotranslational insertion process, cell-free expression systems using e. coli and p. denitrificans extracts have been established. expression of  subunit i in the presence of the detergent brij-35 produces high amounts of "solubilized" subunit i which can be purified in good yield. with this system it  may be feasible to trap and purify assembly intermediates after adding free cofactors, purified assembly proteins, or p. denitrificans membranes.

AB  == the two subunit cytochrome bc complex (norbc) isolated from membranes of the model denitrifying soil bacterium paracoccus denitrificans is the best characterized example of the bacterial respiratory nitric oxide reductases. these are members of the superfamily of heme-copper oxidases and are characterized by the elemental composition of their active site, which contains nonheme iron rather than copper, at which the reductive coupling of two molecules of nitric oxide to form nitrous oxide is catalyzed. this chapter describes methods for the  purification and characterization of both native nitric oxide reductase from p. denitrificans and a recombinant form of the enzyme expressed in escherichia coli, which enables site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic subunit norb. examples are given of electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra that characterize the enzyme in a number of redox states, along with a method for the routine assay of the complex using its natural electron donor pseudoazurin.

TI  == morphological change in cellular granule formation of poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyrate] caused by dna-binding-related mutations of an autoregulated repressor phar.
AB  == phap is a major poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [p(3hb)]-granule-associated protein.  its gene expression is controlled by an autoregulated repressor, phar, in paracoccus denitrificans. the packing force of the p(3hb) granule by phap is greatly influenced by the number of phap molecules. in this study, the effects of dna-binding-ability-reduced mutations of phar on morphological change in the cellular granule formation of p(3hb) were examined under a transmission electron  microscope using an escherichia coli recombinant system. microscopic observation  indicated that stronger packing of p(3hb) granules took place when the number of  phap molecules was increased by reduction in the dna-binding ability of phar.

TI  == the appa and ppsr proteins from rhodobacter sphaeroides can establish a redox-dependent signal chain but fail to transmit blue-light signals in other bacteria.
AB  == the appa protein of rhodobacter sphaeroides has the unique ability to sense and transmit redox and light signals. in response to decreasing oxygen tension, appa  antagonizes the transcriptional regulator ppsr, which represses the expression of photosynthesis genes, including the puc operon. this mechanism, which is based on direct protein-protein interaction, is prevented by blue-light absorption of the  bluf domain located in the n-terminal part of appa. in order to test whether appa and ppsr are sufficient to transmit redox and light signals, we expressed these proteins in three different bacterial species and monitored oxygen- and blue-light-dependent puc expression either directly or by using a luciferase-based reporter construct. the appa/ppsr system could mediate redox-dependent gene expression in the alphaproteobacteria rhodobacter capsulatus and paracoccus denitrificans but not in the gammaproteobacterium escherichia coli. analysis of a prra mutant strain of r. sphaeroides strongly suggests that light-dependent gene expression requires a balanced interplay of the appa/ppsr system with the prra response regulator. therefore, the appa/ppsr system was unable to establish light signaling in other bacteria. based on our data, we present a model for the interdependence of appa/ppsr signaling and the prra transcriptional activator.

TI  == autoregulator protein phar for biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate [p(3hb)] possibly has two separate domains that bind to the target dna and p(3hb): functional mapping of amino acid residues responsible for dna binding.
AB  == phar from paracoccus denitrificans functions as a repressor or autoregulator of the expression of genes encoding phasin protein (phap) and phar itself, both of which are components of polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) granules (a. maehara, s. taguchi, t. nishiyama, t. yamane, and y. doi, j. bacteriol. 184:3992-4002, 2002). phar is a unique regulatory protein in that it also has the ability to bind tightly to an effector molecule, pha polyester. in this study, by using a quartz  crystal microbalance, we obtained direct evidence that phar binds to the target dna and poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [p(3hb)], one of the phas, at the same time.  to identify the phar amino acid residues responsible for dna binding, deletion and pcr-mediated random point mutation experiments were carried out with the gene encoding the phar protein. phar point mutants with decreased dna-binding abilities were efficiently screened by an in vivo monitoring assay system coupled with gene expression of green fluorescent protein in escherichia coli. dna-binding abilities of the wild-type and mutants of recombinant phar expressed  in e. coli were evaluated using a gel shift assay and a surface plasmon resonance analysis. these experiments revealed that basic amino acids and a tyrosine in the n-terminal region, which is highly conserved among phar homologs, are responsible for dna binding. however, most of the mutants with decreased dna-binding abilities were unaffected in their ability to bind p(3hb), strongly suggesting that phar has two separate domains capable of binding to the target dna and p(3hb).

TI  == a new assay for nitric oxide reductase reveals two conserved glutamate residues form the entrance to a proton-conducting channel in the bacterial enzyme.
AB  == a specific amperometric assay was developed for the membrane-bound nor [no (nitric oxide) reductase] from the model denitrifying bacterium paracoccus denitrificans using its natural electron donor, pseudoazurin, as a co-substrate.  the method allows the rapid and specific assay of no reduction catalysed by recombinant nor expressed in the cytoplasmic membranes of escherichia coli. the effect on enzyme activity of substituting alanine, aspartate or glutamine for two highly conserved glutamate residues, which lie in a periplasmic facing loop between transmembrane helices iii and iv in the catalytic subunit of nor, was determined using this method. three of the substitutions (e122a, e125a and e125d) lead to an almost complete loss of nor activity. some activity is retained when either glu122 or glu125 is substituted with a glutamine residue, but only replacement of glu122 with an aspartate residue retains a high level of activity. these results are interpreted in terms of these residues forming the mouth of a channel that conducts substrate protons to the active site of nor during turnover. this channel is also likely to be that responsible in the coupling of proton movement to electron transfer during the oxidation of fully reduced nor with oxygen [u. flock, n. j. watmough and p. adelroth (2005) biochemistry 44, 10711-10719].

TI  == the melas mutations 3946 and 3949 perturb the critical structure in a conserved loop of the nd1 subunit of mitochondrial complex i.
AB  == the nd1 subunit gene of the mitochondrial nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i) is a hot spot for mutations causing leber hereditary optic neuropathy and several mutations causing the mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (melas). we have used escherichia coli and paracoccus denitrificans as model systems to study the effect of mutations 3946 and 3949, which change conserved residues in nd1 and cause melas. the vicinity of these mutations was also explored with a series of mutations in charged residues. the 3946 mutation results in e214k substitution in human nd1. replacement of the  equivalent residue in e. coli with lysine or glutamine detracted from enzyme assembly and the assembled enzyme was inactive. however, the equivalent e234q mutant enzyme in p. denitrificans failed to assemble completely (or was rapidly degraded). also the corresponding substitution with aspartate decreased the enzyme activity in p. denitrificans and e. coli. the 3949-equivalent substitution, y229h in e. coli, lowered the catalytic activity by 30%. in addition, an activation of the enzyme during catalytic turnover was seen in this  bacterial ndh-1, something that was even more pronounced in another mutant in the same loop, d213e. several other mutations in this region decreased the enzyme activity. the studied melas mutations are situated in a matrix-side loop, which appears to be highly sensitive to structural perturbations. the results provide new information on the function of the region affected by the melas mutations 3946 and 3949 that is not obtainable from patient samples or current eukaryote models.

TI  == transcription factor nnr from paracoccus denitrificans is a sensor of both nitric oxide and oxygen: isolation of nnr* alleles encoding effector-independent proteins and evidence for a haem-based sensing mechanism.
AB  == the nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase regulator (nnr) from paracoccus  denitrificans activates transcription in response to nitric oxide (no). the mechanism of no sensing has not been elucidated for nnr, or for any of its orthologues from the fnr/crp family of transcriptional regulators. using regulated expression of the nnr gene in escherichia coli, evidence has now been obtained to indicate that activation of nnr by no does not require de novo synthesis of the nnr polypeptide. in anaerobic cultures, nnr is inactivated slowly following removal of the source of no. in contrast, exposure of anaerobically grown cultures to oxygen causes rapid inactivation of nnr, suggesting that the protein is inactivated directly by oxygen. by random and site-directed mutagenesis, two variants of nnr were isolated (with substitutions  of arginine at position 80) that show high levels of activity in anaerobic cultures in the absence of no. these proteins remain substantially inactive in aerobic cultures, suggesting that the substitutions uncouple the no- and oxygen-signalling mechanisms, thus providing further evidence that nnr senses both molecules. structural modelling suggested that arg-80 is close to the c-helix that forms the monomer-monomer interface in other members of the fnr/crp  family and plays an important role in transducing the activating signal between the regulatory and dna binding domains. assays of nnr activity in a haem-deficient mutant of e. coli provided preliminary evidence to indicate that nnr activity is haem dependent.

TI  == elucidation of dominant effect on initial bacterial adhesion onto polymer surfaces prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization.
AB  == surface-modified polyethylene (pe) membrane sheets were prepared by the radiation-induced graft polymerization (rigp) of an epoxy-group-containing monomer, glycidyl methacrylate (gma). the epoxy ring of gma was opened by introducing diethylamine (dea) or sodium sulfite (ss). we examined the properties of these sheets by measuring the amount of grafting polymer, surface roughness and membrane potential, and also investigated the adhesion of five gram-negative  bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas fluorescens and paracoccus denitrificans, onto the prepared sheet surfaces. a linear relationship between the degree of grafting (dg) and surface roughness was observed. moreover, membrane potential was dependent on the amount  of dea or ss as the ionizable group. these results indicate that rigp enables the control of the physicochemical properties of such a sheet surface by adjusting dg and the subsequent conversion of functional groups. a batch test on bacterial adhesion onto the sheets clarified that the dea-containing sheet (dea sheet) exhibited an adhesion rate constant, k, significantly greater than those of other types of sheet. clearly, the adhesion rate constant of the dea sheet increased with dg, indicating that electrostatic interaction is the most decisive factor for bacterial adhesion when it works as an attractive force. furthermore, the densities of bacteria adhering onto the gma-containing sheet (gma sheet) and the  ss-containing sheet (ss sheet) were almost the same as that onto a pe sheet, whereas that onto a dea sheet significantly increased. thus, the introduction of  the gma- and ss-containing graft chain did not have much influence on bacterial adhesion onto the surfaces, supporting the conclusion that the promotion of bacterial adhesion onto the gma and ss sheets was due to an increase in surface area resulting from rigp. moreover, the scanning electron microscopy images of the sheet surfaces indicate that the conditions and morphologies of initial bacterial adhesion are dependent on surface properties, particularly membrane potential.

TI  == a dynamic zinc redox switch.
AB  == the crystal structures of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme (gfa) from paracoccus denitrificans, which catalyzes the formation of s-hydroxymethylglutathione from formaldehyde and glutathione, and its complex with glutathione (gfa-gtt) have been determined. gfa has a new fold with two zinc-sulfur centers, one that is structural (zinc tetracoordinated) and one catalytic (zinc apparently tricoordinated). in gfa-gtt, the catalytic zinc is displaced due to disulfide bond formation of glutathione with one of the zinc-coordinating cysteines. soaking crystals of gfa-gtt with formaldehyde restores the holoenzyme. accordingly, the displaced zinc forms a complex by scavenging formaldehyde and glutathione. the activation of formaldehyde and of glutathione in this zinc complex favors the final nucleophilic addition, followed by relocation of zinc in the catalytic site. therefore, the structures of gfa and gfa-gtt draw the critical association between a dynamic zinc redox switch and a nucleophilic addition as a new facet of the redox activity of zinc-sulfur sites.

TI  == optimization of an escherichia coli system for cell-free synthesis of selectively n-labelled proteins for rapid analysis by nmr spectroscopy.
AB  == cell-free protein synthesis offers rapid access to proteins that are selectively  labelled with [15n]amino acids and suitable for analysis by nmr spectroscopy without chromatographic purification. a system based on an escherichia coli cell  extract was optimized with regard to protein yield and minimal usage of 15n-labelled amino acid, and examined for the presence of metabolic by-products which could interfere with the nmr analysis. yields of up to 1.8 mg of human cyclophilin a per ml of reaction medium were obtained by expression of a synthetic gene. equivalent yields were obtained using transcription directed by either t7 or tandem phage lambdapr and pl promoters, when the reactions were supplemented with purified phage t7 or e. coli rna polymerase. nineteen samples,  each selectively labelled with a different 15n-enriched amino acid, were produced and analysed directly by nmr spectroscopy after ultracentrifugation. cross-peaks  from metabolic by-products were evident in the 15n-hsqc spectra of 13 of the samples. all metabolites were found to be small molecules that could be separated readily from the labelled proteins by dialysis. no significant transamination activity was observed except for [15n]asp, where an enzyme in the cell extract efficiently converted asp-->asn. this activity was suppressed by replacing the normally high levels of potassium glutamate in the reaction mixture with ammonium or potassium acetate. in addition, the activity of peptide deformylase appeared to be generally reduced in the cell-free expression system.

TI  == functional roles of four conserved charged residues in the membrane domain subunit nuoa of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase from escherichia coli.
AB  == the h(+)(na(+))-translocating nadh-quinone (q) oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of escherichia coli is composed of 13 different subunits (nuoa-n). subunit nuoa (nd3, nqo7) is one of the seven membrane domain subunits that are considered to be involved in h(+)(na(+)) translocation. we demonstrated that in the paracoccus  denitrificans ndh-1 subunit, nqo7 (nd3) directly interacts with peripheral subunits nqo6 (psst) and nqo4 (49 kda) by using cross-linkers (di bernardo, s., and yagi, t. (2001) febs lett. 508, 385-388 and kao, m.-c., matsuno-yagi, a., and yagi, t. (2004) biochemistry 43, 3750-3755). to investigate the structural and functional roles of conserved charged amino acid residues, a nuoa knock-out mutant and site-specific mutants k46a, e51a, d79n, d79a, e81q, e81a, and d79n/e81q were constructed by utilizing chromosomal dna manipulation. in terms of immunochemical and nadh dehydrogenase activity-staining analyses, all site-specific mutants are similar to the wild type, suggesting that those nuoa site-specific mutations do not significantly affect the assembly of peripheral subunits in situ. in addition, site-specific mutants showed similar deamino-nadh-k(3)fe(cn)(6) reductase activity to the wild type. the k46a mutation scarcely inhibited deamino-nadh-q reductase activity. in contrast, e51a, d79a, d79n, e81a, and e81q mutation partially suppressed deamino-nadh-q reductase activity to 30, 90, 40, 40, and 50%, respectively. the double mutant d79n/e81q almost completely lost the energy-transducing ndh-1 activities but did not display any loss of deamino-nadh-k(3)fe(cn)(6) reductase activity. the possible functional roles of residues asp-79 and glu-81 were discussed.

AB  == the folding of membrane proteins was addressed using outer membrane protein porin from the soil bacterium paracoccus denitrificans (p. den.). ir spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis were used to probe the effect of mutagenesis on the thermal stability of the protein. secondary structure analysis by amide i ir spectroscopy showed that the  wild-type protein was predominantly composed of beta-sheet, which supports the x-ray crystal structure information (a. hirsch, j. breed, k. saxena, o.-m. h. richter, b. ludwig, k. diederichs, and w. welte, febs letters, 1997, vol. 404, pp. 208-210). the mutants e81q, w74c, and e81q/d148n were shown to have similar secondary structure composition as the wild type. wild-type protein and the mutants in detergent micelles underwent irreversible denaturation as a result of  heating. transition temperature calculated from the amide i analysis revealed that mutant porins were slightly less stable compared to the wild type. the protein in micelles showed complete monomerization of the trimer above 85 degrees c. in native-like conditions (provided by liposomes), no change was observed in the secondary structure of the protein until 95 degrees c. this is supported by sds-page as no change in quaternary structure was observed, proving that the proteins are structurally thermostable in liposomes as compared to micelles. our  studies demonstrated that porins resistant to detergents and proteases are highly thermostable as well.

AB  == the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans is composed of 14 different subunits (designated nqo1-14), seven of which are located in the membrane domain and the other seven in the peripheral domain. it has been previously reported that membrane domain subunit nqo7 (nd3) directly interacts with peripheral subunit nqo6 (psst) by using a cross-linker, m-maleimidobenzoyl-n-hydrosuccinimide ester, and heterologous expression [di bernardo, s., and yagi, t. (2001) febs lett. 508, 385-388]. to further explore the near-neighbor relationship of the subunits, a zero-length cross-linker, 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (edc), and the paracoccus membranes were used, and the cross-linked products were examined with antibodies  specific to subunits nqo1-11. the nqo6 subunit was cross-linked to subunit nqo9 (tyky). in addition, a ternary product of nqo3 (75k), nqo6, and nqo7 and binary products of nqo3 and nqo6 and of nqo6 and nqo7 were observed, but a binary product of nqo3 and nqo7 was not detected. the nqo4 (49k) subunit was found to be associated with the nqo7 subunit. furthermore, paracoccus subunits nqo3, nqo6, and nqo7 were heterologously coexpressed in escherichia coli, and edc cross-linking experiments were carried out using the e. coli membranes expressing these three subunits. the results were the same as those obtained with paracoccus membranes. on the basis of the data, subunit arrangements of ndh-1 were discussed.

TI  == fine-tuned regulation by oxygen and nitric oxide of the activity of a semi-synthetic fnr-dependent promoter and expression of denitrification enzymes in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == in paracoccus denitrificans at least three fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator (fnr)-like proteins [fnrp, nitrite and nitric oxide reductases regulator (nnr) and narr] control the expression of several genes necessary for denitrifying growth. to gain more insight into this regulation, beta-galactosidase activity from a plasmid carrying the lacz gene fused to the escherichia coli melr promoter with the consensus fnr-binding (ff) site was examined. strains defective in the fnrp gene produced only very low levels of beta-galactosidase, indicating that fnrp is the principal activator of the ff promoter. anoxic beta-galactosidase levels were much higher relative to those under oxic growth and were strongly dependent on the nitrogen electron acceptor used, maximal activity being promoted by n(2)o. additions of nitrate or nitroprusside lowered beta-galactosidase expression resulting from an oxic to micro-oxic switch. these results suggest that the activity of fnrp is influenced  not only by oxygen, but also by other factors, most notably by no concentration.  observations of nitric oxide reductase (nor) activity in a nitrite-reductase-deficient strain and in cells treated with haemoglobin provided evidence for dual regulation of the synthesis of this enzyme, partly independent  of no. both regulatory modes were operative in the fnrp-deficient strain, but not in the nnr-deficient strain, suggesting involvement of the nnr protein. this conclusion was further substantiated by comparing the respective nor promoter activities.

TI  == characterization of cluster n5 as a fast-relaxing [4fe-4s] cluster in the nqo3 subunit of the proton-translocating nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase from paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the nadh-quinone oxidoreductase from paracoccus denitrificans consists of 14 subunits (nqo1-14) and contains one fmn and eight iron-sulfur clusters. the nqo3  subunit possesses fully conserved 11 cys and 1 his in its n-terminal region and is considered to harbor three iron-sulfur clusters; however, only one binuclear (n1b) and one tetranuclear (n4) were previously identified. in this study, the nqo3 subunit containing 1x[2fe-2s] and 2x[4fe-4s] clusters was expressed in escherichia coli. the second [4fe-4s](1+) cluster is detected by epr spectroscopy below 6 k, exhibiting very fast spin relaxation. the resolved epr spectrum of this cluster is broad and nearly axial. the subunit exhibits an absorption-type epr signal around g approximately 5 region below 6 k, most likely arising from an s = 3/2 ground state of the fast-relaxing [4fe-4s](1+) species. the substitution  of the conserved his(106) with cys specifically affected the fast-relaxing [4fe-4s](1+) cluster, suggesting that this cluster is coordinated by his(106). in the cholate-treated ndh-1-enriched p. denitrificans membranes, we observed epr signals arising from a [4fe-4s] cluster below 6 k, exhibiting properties similar  to those of cluster n5 detected in other complex i/ndh-1 and of the fast-relaxing [4fe-4s](1+) cluster in the expressed nqo3 subunit. hence, we propose that the his-coordinated [4fe-4s] cluster corresponds to cluster n5.

TI  == a turbo engine with automatic transmission? how to marry chemicomotion to the subtleties and robustness of life.
AB  == most genomes are much more complex than required for the minimum chemistry of life. evolution has selected sophistication more than life itself. could this also apply to bioenergetics? we first examine mechanisms through which bioenergetics could deliver sophistication. we illustrate possible benefits of the turbo-charging of catabolic pathways, of loose coupling, low-gear catabolism, automatic transmission in energy coupling, and of homeostasis. mechanisms for such phenomena may reside at the level of individual proton pumps, or consist of  rerouting of electrons over parallel pathways. the mechanisms may be confined to  preexisting components, or involve the plasticity of gene expression that is so characteristic of most living organisms. these possible benefits lead us to the conjecture that also bioenergetics has evolved more for sophistication than for necessity. we next discuss a hitherto unresolved enigma, i.e. that bioenergetics  does not seem to be critical for the physiological state. to decide on how critical bioenergetics is, we quantified the control exerted by catabolism on important physiological functions such as growth rate and growth yield. we also determined whether a growth inhibition mostly affected bioenergetics (catabolism) or anabolism; if atp increases with growth rate, then growth should be considered energy (catabolism) limited. the experimental results for escherichia coli pinpoint the enigma: its energy metabolism (catabolism) is not critical for growth rate. these results might suggest that because it has no direct control over cell function, bioenergetics is unimportant. paradoxically however, in biology, highly important mechanisms tend to have little control on cell function, precisely because of that importance. sophistication in terms of homeostatic mechanisms has evolved to guarantee robustness of the most important  functions: the most important mechanisms are redundant in biology. bioenergetics  may be an excellent example of this paradox, in line with the above conjecture. it may be highly important and sophisticated. we then discuss work that has begun to focus on the sophistication of bioenergetics. homeostasis of the energetics of dna structure in e. coli is extensive. it relies both on preexisting components and on responsive gene expression. the vastly parallel electron-transfer network  of paracoccus denitrificans engages in sophisticated dynamic and hierarchical regulation. the growth yield of the organism can depend on which terminal oxidases are active. effective proton translocation may vary due to rerouting of  electrons. we conclude that much sophistication of bioenergetics will be discovered in this era of functional genomics.

AB  == bacterial nitric oxide reductases are integral membrane proteins that catalyze the reduction of two molecules of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide and water. they are diverged members of the superfamily of heme/copper oxidases. the enzyme from  paracoccus denitrificans (norbc) contains two subunits; norb comprises the membrane-integrated active site, which harbors a heme iron/non-heme iron dinuclear center. norc is a membrane-anchored c-type cytochrome and presumably the site of electron uptake. a dna construct encoding the water-soluble domain of norc (norc(sol)) was coexpressed with the cytochrome c maturation genes in escherichia coli. using redox potentiometry, electronic absorption, circular dichroism (cd), magnetic cd (mcd), nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy the following observations were made: (i) norc(sol) was folded into a alpha-helical structure. (ii) the low-spin heme iron was coordinated by histidine and methionine in both redox states. (iii) the  midpoint redox potential of the norc(sol) heme was 183 mv, much lower than the corresponding value of 275 mv in the norbc complex. this points to an increased solvent exposure of the norc(sol) heme compared to in the native norbc complex and shows that the electronic properties of norc are modulated by norb in the complex. (iv) the epr and mcd spectra of norc(sol) were considered alongside the  spectra of norbc, which has helped to resolve the contribution that different redox centers make in the holo-enzyme complex.

TI  == identification of two domains and distal histidine ligands to the four haems in the bacterial c-type cytochrome napc; the prototype connector between quinol/quinone and periplasmic oxido-reductases.
AB  == napc is a tetra-haem member of a family of bacterial membrane-anchored multi-haem c -type cytochromes implicated in electron transfer between membrane quinols and  periplasmic enzymes. the water-soluble tetra-haem fragment of paracoccus pantotrophus napc has been expressed as a periplasmic protein (napc(sol)) in paracoccus denitrificans, p. pantotrophus and escherichia coli. site-specific mutagenesis of napc(sol), combined with spectroscopic studies, suggests that each haem iron centre has bis -histidinyl co-ordination. four proximal ligands arise from each of four cys-xaa-xaa-cys-his haem-binding motifs; candidates for the four distal ligands are his(81), his(99), his(174) and his(194). napc(h81a), napc(h99a), napc(h174a) and napc(h194a) mutants (with alanine substituted for each of the four candidate residues) have all been purified from e. coli. in each case, one of the haems has become high-spin, as judged by the presence of a broad absorption band between 620 nm and 650 nm for the oxidized cytochrome; this feature is absent for wild-type protein and presumably arises because of the absence of the distal histidine ligand from one of the haems. napc(h81a) and napc(h174a) are less well expressed in e. coli than napc(h99a) and napc(h194a) and cannot be detected when expressed in p. denitrificans or p. pantotrophus. in  vitro and in vivo complementation studies demonstrate that the soluble periplasmic napc can mediate electron transfer from quinols to the periplasmic nitrate reductase. this capacity was retained in vitro with the napc(h99a) and napc(h194a) mutants but was lost in vivo. a model for the structural organization of napc(sol) into two domains, each containing a di-haem pair, is proposed. in this model, each haem pair obtains one distal haem ligand from its own domain and a second from the other domain. the suggestion of two domains is supported by observations that the 24 kda napc(sol) cleaves to yield a 12 kda haem-staining band. determination of the cleavage site showed it was between two equally sized  di-haem domains predicted from sequence analysis.

TI  == specificity of the interaction between the paracoccus denitrificans oxidase and its substrate cytochrome c: comparing the mitochondrial to the homologous bacterial cytochrome c(552), and its truncated and site-directed mutants.
AB  == under in vitro conditions, bacterial cytochrome c oxidases may accept several nonhomologous c-type electron donors, including the evolutionarily related mitochondrial cytochrome c. several lines of evidence suggest that in intact membranes the heme aa(3) oxidase from paracoccus denitrificans receives its electrons from the membrane-bound cytochrome c(552). both the structures of the oxidase and of a heterologously expressed, soluble fragment of the c(552) have been determined recently, but no direct structural information about a static cocomplex is available. here, we analyze the kinetic properties of the isolated oxidase with the full-size c(552), with two truncated soluble forms, and with a set of site-specific mutants within the presumed docking site of the cytochrome,  all heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. our data indicate that all three forms, the wild type and both truncations, are fully competent kinetically  and exhibit biphasic kinetic behavior, however, under widely different ionic strength conditions. when mutations in lysine residues clustered around the interaction domain were introduced into the smallest fragment of c(552), both kinetic parameters, k(m) and k(cat), were drastically influenced. on the other hand, when the nonmutated truncated form was used to donate electrons to a set of oxidase mutants with replacements clustered along the docking site on subunit ii, we observe distinct differences when comparing the kinetic properties of the widely used horse heart cytochrome c with those of the bacterial c(552). we conclude that the specific docking sites for the two types of cytochromes differ  to some extent.

TI  == a novel type of nitric-oxide reductase. escherichia coli flavorubredoxin.
AB  == escherichia coli flavorubredoxin is a member of the family of the a-type flavoproteins, which are built by two core domains: a metallo-beta-lactamase-like domain, at the n-terminal region, harboring a non-heme di-iron site, and a flavodoxin-like domain, containing one fmn moiety. the enzyme from e. coli has an extra module at the c terminus, containing a rubredoxin-like center. the a-type flavoproteins are widespread among strict and facultative anaerobes, as deduced from the analysis of the complete prokaryotic genomes. in this report we showed that the recombinant enzyme purified from e. coli has nitric-oxide reductase activity with a turnover number of approximately 15 mol of no.mol enzyme(-1).s(-1), which was well within the range of those determined for the canonical heme b(3)-fe(b) containing nitric-oxide reductases (e.g. approximately  10-50 mol no.mol enzyme(-1).s(-1) for the paracoccus denitrificans nor). furthermore, it was shown that the activity was due to the a-type flavoprotein core, as the rubredoxin domain alone exhibited no activity. thus, a novel family  of prokaryotic no reductases, with a non-heme di-iron site as the catalytic center, was established.

TI  == a repressor protein, phar, regulates polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthesis via its direct interaction with pha.
AB  == phasins (phap) are predominantly polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) granule-associated proteins that positively affect pha synthesis. recently, we reported that the phar gene, which is located downstream of phap in paracoccus denitrificans, codes for a negative regulator involved in phap expression. in this study, dnase i footprinting revealed that phar specifically binds to two regions located upstream of phap and phar, suggesting that phar plays a role in the regulation of phap expression as well as autoregulation. many tgc-rich sequences were found in  upstream elements recognized by phar. phar in the crude lysate of recombinant escherichia coli was able to rebind specifically to poly[(r)-3-hydroxybutyrate] [p(3hb)] granules. furthermore, artificial p(3hb) granules and 3hb oligomers caused the dissociation of phar from phar-dna complexes, but native pha granules, which were covered with phap or other nonspecific proteins, did not cause the dissociation. these results suggest that phar is able to sense both the onset of  pha synthesis and the enlargement of the granules through direct binding to pha.  however, free phar is probably unable to sense the mature pha granules which are  already covered sufficiently with phap and/or other proteins. an in vitro expression experiment revealed that phap expression was repressed by the addition of phar and was derepressed by the addition of p(3hb). based on these findings, we present here a possible model accounting for the phar-mediated mechanism of pha synthesis. widespread distribution of phar homologs in short-chain-length pha-producing bacteria suggests a common and important role of phar-mediated regulation of pha synthesis.

TI  == characterization of the membrane domain nqo11 subunit of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase of paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans consists of at least 14 unlike subunits (designated nqo1-14). the ndh-1 is composed of two segments (the peripheral and membrane segments). the membrane domain segment appears to be made up of seven subunits (nqo7, -8, -10-14). in this report, the characterization of the paracoccus nqo11 subunit has been investigated. an antibody against the c-terminal 12 amino acid residues of the paracoccus nqo11 subunit (nqo11c) has been raised. the nqo11c antibody reacted with a single band (11 kda) of the paracoccus membranes and cross-reacted with rhodobactor capsulatus membranes. the nqo11 subunit was not able to be extracted from the paracoccus membranes by nai or alkaline treatment, unlike the  peripheral subunits (nqo1 and nqo6). the c-terminal region of the paracoccus nqo11 is exposed to the cytoplasmic phase. for further characterization of the paracoccus nqo11 subunit, the subunit was overexpressed in escherichia coli by using the maltose-binding protein (mbp) fusion system. the mbp-fused nqo11 subunit was expressed in the e. coli membranes (but not in soluble phase) and was extracted by triton x-100. the isolated mbp-fused nqo11 subunit interacted with the phospholipid vesicles and suppressed their membrane fluidity. topological studies of the nqo11 subunit expressed in e. coli membranes have been performed by using cysteine mapping and immunochemical analyses. the data suggest that the  nqo11 subunit has three transmembrane segments and its c-terminus protrudes into  the cytoplasmic phase.

TI  == transcription factor fnrp from paracoccus denitrificans contains an iron-sulfur cluster and is activated by anoxia: identification of essential cysteine residues.
AB  == the paracoccus denitrificans transcription factor fnrp has been characterized using artificial fnr-dependent promoter-lacz fusion plasmids in escherichia coli. fnrp can activate both class i and class ii fnr-dependent promoters in response to anoxia but shows a marked preference for the class ii promoter, where the fnr  binding site is centered at -41.5 with respect to the transcription start site. fnrp was found to be inactive in an iscs mutant in vivo, demonstrating a requirement for cysteine desulfurase activity to assemble an iron-sulfur cluster  in fnrp. accordingly, an iron-sulfur cluster could be reconstituted into the purified protein in vitro using cysteine desulfurase, ferrous ions, and cysteine. thus, fnrp is a true orthologue of fnr from e. coli and switches on target genes  in response to anoxia. inactivation of fnrp by oxygen very likely involves the oxidative disassembly of an iron-sulfur cluster. possible ligands for the iron-sulfur cluster were identified by substituting each of the seven cysteine residues with serine and characterizing the altered proteins in vivo. four substituted proteins showed activities less than 5% of the wild type, and so identify the four cysteines (cys-14, cys-17, cys-25, and cys-113) that are most likely to be involved in cluster ligation. the effects of n-oxides, no-releasing  compounds and a nitrosating agent on fnr and fnrp activity were investigated in vivo using the reporter system. both proteins are very sensitive to the inclusion of sodium nitroprusside (a source of no(+)) in defined growth media but are only  moderately sensitive to those sources of no that were tested.

TI  == characterization of the reduction of selenate and tellurite by nitrate reductases.
AB  == preliminary studies showed that the periplasmic nitrate reductase (nap) of rhodobacter sphaeroides and the membrane-bound nitrate reductases of escherichia  coli are able to reduce selenate and tellurite in vitro with benzyl viologen as an electron donor. in the present study, we found that this is a general feature  of denitrifiers. both the periplasmic and membrane-bound nitrate reductases of ralstonia eutropha, paracoccus denitrificans, and paracoccus pantotrophus can utilize potassium selenate and potassium tellurite as electron acceptors. in order to characterize these reactions, the periplasmic nitrate reductase of r. sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans il106 was histidine tagged and purified. the v(max) and k(m) were determined for nitrate, tellurite, and selenate. for nitrate, values of 39 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) and 0.12 mm were obtained for v(max) and k(m), respectively, whereas the v(max) values for tellurite and selenate were 40- and 140-fold lower, respectively. these low activities can explain the observation that depletion of the nitrate reductase in r. sphaeroides does not modify the mic of tellurite for this organism.

TI  == crystal structure of chaperonin-60 from paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the crystal structure of chaperonin-60 from paracoccus denitrificans (p.cpn60) has been determined at 3.2 a resolution by the molecular replacement method. two  heptameric rings of identical subunits of p.cpn60 in adjacent asymmetric units are stacked in a back-to-back manner and form a cylinder, as found in groel, cpn60 from escherichia coli. with respect to the unliganded groel structure, each subunit of p.cpn60 tilts 2 degrees outwards and the apical domain twists 4 degrees counter-clockwise in the top view in a hinge-like manner, rendering the central hole 5 a wider. despite the subunit tilts, both rings in p.cpn60 contact  at two sites of the equatorial domain in the same way as in groel. interactions between residues 434 and 434, and 463 and 463 observed in groel were not found in p.cpn60, and the interaction between 452 and 461 was weaker in p.cpn60 than in groel. the unique hydrogen bond between 468 and 471 was observed at the right site in p.cpn60, which could account for why the subunits tilt outwards. the contact surface area was reduced at the left site, which is similar to the observed changes in the groel structures induced by atp binding. in general, inter-ring interactions in p.cpn60 were weakened, which is consistent with findings that p.cpn60 is observed in single-ring forms as well as in double-ring  forms.

TI  == the dynamics of the macromolecular composition of biomass.
AB  == the biomass composition of microorganisms depends on the growth conditions. this  study explores whether a two-component model can explain how the elemental and macromolecular composition of the biomass of bacteria varies with the specific growth rate. the model describes the rates at which microorganisms assimilate substrates into reserves and utilize reserves for maintenance and growth. crucial model assumptions are that biomass consists of reserves and structure and that each of these components has an invariant composition. the composition of biomass can vary when the ratio between reserves and structure varies. literature data on the macromolecular composition of escherichia coli, cultivated on various substrates, show that the protein, rna and dna content of biomass follow a distinctive trend when plotted as a function of the dry-weight-specific growth rate. this observation leads to the proposition that the macromolecular composition of e. coli depends directly on the growth rate, and only indirectly on the carbon- and energy-source used as substrate. we show that the variation of the macromolecular composition of e. coli over its entire range of growth rates can be described with invariant macromolecular compositions of the reserve and structural components of biomass. the model is also applied to our data on a succinate-limited continuous culture of paracoccus denitrificans.

TI  == the carboxin-binding site on paracoccus denitrificans succinate:quinone reductase identified by mutations.
AB  == succinate:quinone reductase catalyzes electron transfer from succinate to quinone in aerobic respiration. carboxin is a specific inhibitor of this enzyme from several different organisms. we have isolated mutant strains of the bacterium paracoccus denitrificans that are resistant to carboxin due to mutations in the succinate:quinone reductase. the mutations identify two amino acid residues, his228 in sdhb and asp89 in sdhd, that most likely constitute part of a carboxin-binding site. this site is in the same region of the enzyme as the proposed active site for ubiquinone reduction. from the combined mutant data and  structural information derived from escherichia coli and wolinella succinogenes quinol:fumarate reductase, we suggest that carboxin acts by blocking binding of ubiquinone to the active site. the block would be either by direct exclusion of ubiquinone from the active site or by occlusion of a pore that leads to the active site.

TI  == maximal expression of membrane-bound nitrate reductase in paracoccus is induced by nitrate via a third fnr-like regulator named narr.
AB  == respiratory reduction of nitrate to nitrite is the first key step in the denitrification process that leads to nitrate loss from soils. in paracoccus pantotrophus, the enzyme system that catalyzes this reaction is encoded by the narkghji gene cluster. expression of this cluster is maximal under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate. upstream from nark is narr, a gene encoding a member of the fnr family of transcriptional activators. narr is transcribed divergently from the other nar genes. mutational analysis reveals that narr is required for maximal expression of the membrane-bound nitrate reductase genes and nark but has no other regulatory function related to denitrification. narr is shown to require nitrate and/or nitrite is order to activate gene expression. the n-terminal region of the protein lacks the cysteine residues that are required for formation of an oxygen-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster in some other members of the fnr family. also, narr lacks a crucial residue involved in interactions of this family of regulators with the sigma(70)  subunit of rna polymerase, indicating that a different mechanism is used to promote transcription. narr is also found in paracoccus denitrificans, indicating that this species contains at least three fnr homologues.

TI  == regulation of expression of terminal oxidases in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == in order to study the induction of terminal oxidases in paracoccus denitrificans, their promoters were fused to the lacz reporter gene and analysed in the wild-type strain, in an fnrp-negative mutant, in a cytochrome bc1-negative mutant, and in six single or double oxidase-negative mutant strains. the strains  were grown under aerobic, semi-aerobic, and denitrifying conditions. the oxygen-sensing transcriptional-regulatory protein fnrp negatively regulated the activity of the qox promoter, which controls expression of the ba3-type quinol oxidase, while it positively regulated the activity of the cco promoter, which controls expression of the cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase. the ctadii and ctac promoters, which control the expression of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase subunits i and ii, respectively, were not regulated by fnrp. the activities of the latter two promoters, however, did decrease with decreasing oxygen concentrations in the growth medium, suggesting that an additional oxygen-sensing mechanism exists that regulates transcription of ctadii and ctac. apparently, the intracellular oxygen concentration (as sensed by fnrp) was not the only signal to which the oxidase promoters responded. at given extracellular oxygen status, both the qox and the cco promoters responded to mutations in terminal oxidase genes, whereas the ctadii and ctac promoters did not. the change of electron distribution through the respiratory network, resulting from elimination of one or more oxidase genes, may have changed intracellular signals that affect the activities of the qox and cco promoters. on the other hand, the re-routing of electron distribution in the respiratory mutants hardly affected the oxygen consumption rate as compared to that of the wild-type. this suggests that the mutants adapted their respiratory network in such a way that they were able to consume oxygen at a rate similar to that of the wild-type strain.

TI  == two conserved glutamates in the bacterial nitric oxide reductase are essential for activity but not assembly of the enzyme.
AB  == the bacterial nitric oxide reductase (nor) is a divergent member of the family of respiratory heme-copper oxidases. it differs from other family members in that it contains an fe(b)-heme-fe dinuclear catalytic center rather than a cu(b)-heme-fe  center and in that it does not pump protons. several glutamate residues are conserved in nors but are absent in other heme-copper oxidases. to facilitate mutagenesis-based studies of these residues in paracoccus denitrificans nor, we developed two expression systems that enable inactive or poorly active nor to be  expressed, characterized in vivo, and purified. these are (i) a homologous system utilizing the cyca promoter to drive aerobic expression of nor in p. denitrificans and (ii) a heterologous system which provides the first example of  the expression of an integral-membrane cytochrome bc complex in escherichia coli. alanine substitutions for three of the conserved glutamate residues (e125, e198,  and e202) were introduced into nor, and the proteins were expressed in p. denitrificans and e. coli. characterization in intact cells and membranes has demonstrated that two of the glutamates are essential for normal levels of nor activity: e125, which is predicted to be on the periplasmic surface close to helix iv, and e198, which is predicted to lie in the middle of transmembrane helix vi. the subsequent purification and spectroscopic characterization of these enzymes established that they are stable and have a wild-type cofactor composition. possible roles for these glutamates in proton uptake and the chemistry of no reduction at the active site are discussed.

TI  == heterologous nnr-mediated nitric oxide signaling in escherichia coli.
AB  == the transcription factor nnr from paracoccus denitrificans was expressed in a strain of escherichia coli carrying a plasmid-borne fusion of the melr promoter to lacz, with a consensus fnr-binding site 41.5 bp upstream of the transcription  start site. this promoter was activated by nnr under anaerobic growth conditions  in media containing nitrate, nitrite, or the no(+) donor sodium nitroprusside. activation by nitrate was abolished by a mutation in the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis pathway, indicating a requirement for nitrate reductase activity. activation by nitrate was modulated by the inclusion of reduced hemoglobin in culture media, because of the ability of hemoglobin to sequester nitric oxide and nitrite. the ability of nitrate and nitrite to activate nnr is likely due to the  formation of no (or related species) during nitrate and nitrite respiration. amino acids potentially involved in nnr activity were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis, and the activities of nnr derivatives were tested in the e. coli reporter system. substitutions at cys-103 and tyr-35 significantly reduced nnr activity but did not abolish the response to reactive nitrogen species. substitutions at phe-82 and tyr-93 severely impaired nnr activity, but the altered proteins retained the ability to repress an fnr-repressible promoter, so  these mutations have a "positive control" phenotype. it is suggested that phe-82  and tyr-93 identify an activating region of nnr that is involved in an interaction with rna polymerase. replacement of ser-96 with alanine abolished nnr activity, and the protein was undetectable in cell extracts. in contrast, nnr in  which ser-96 was replaced with threonine retained full activity.

AB  == the proton-translocating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- (nadh-) quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans is composed of at least 14 different subunits (nqo1-14). in addition, this enzyme complex houses one flavin mononucleotide (fmn) and 7-8 iron-sulfur clusters as cofactors. the expression and partial characterization of the nqo7 subunit, one of the seven subunits that constitute the hydrophobic sector of the enzyme complex, have been  performed and are reported here. expression of the nqo7 subunit was achieved by use of the glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fusion system together with escherichia coli strains blr(de3)plyss and bl21(de3)plyss. the gst-fused nqo7 subunit was expressed in the membrane fraction of the host cells and was extracted from the membranes by nonionic detergents (triton x-100, dodecyl maltoside). the extracted polypeptide was purified by glutathione affinity column chromatography and characterized. the isolated gst-fused nqo7 subunit (but not the gst alone) was determined to interact with phospholipid vesicles and suppress the membrane fluidity. antibodies against both the n- and c-terminal regions of the deduced primary structure of the nqo7 subunit reacted with a single band (15  kda) of the paracoccus membranes. by use of immunochemical and cysteine residue modification techniques, the topology of the paracoccus nqo7 subunit in the membranes has been examined. the data suggest that the paracoccus nqo7 subunit contains three transmembrane segments and that its n- and c-terminal regions are  directed toward the cytoplasmic and periplasmic phases of the membrane, respectively. the proposed topology of the gst-fused nqo7 subunit expressed in e. coli membranes is consistent with that of the nqo7 subunit in the paracoccus membranes.

TI  == a soxa gene, encoding a diheme cytochrome c, and a sox locus, essential for sulfur oxidation in a new sulfur lithotrophic bacterium.
AB  == a mobilizable suicide vector, psup5011, was used to introduce tn5-mob in a new facultative sulfur lithotrophic bacterium, kct001, to generate mutants defective  in sulfur oxidation (sox(-)). the sox(-) mutants were unable to oxidize thiosulfate while grown mixotrophically in the presence of thiosulfate and succinate. the mutants were also impaired in oxidizing other reduced sulfur compounds and elemental sulfur as evident from the study of substrate oxidation by the whole cells. sulfite oxidase activity was significantly diminished in the  cell extracts of all the mutants. a soxa gene was identified from the transposon-adjacent genomic dna of a sox(-) mutant strain. the sequence analysis  revealed that the soxa open reading frame (orf) is preceded by a potential ribosome binding site and promoter region with -10- and -35-like sequences. the deduced nucleotide sequence of the soxa gene was predicted to code for a protein  of 286 amino acids. it had a signal peptide of 26 n-terminal amino acids. the amino acid sequence showed similarity with a putative gene product of aquifex aeolicus, soluble cytochrome c(551) of chlorobium limicola, and the available partial soxa sequence of paracoccus denitrificans. the soxa-encoded product seems to be a diheme cytochrome c for kct001 and a. aeolicus, but the amino acid sequence of c. limicola cytochrome c(551) revealed a single heme-binding region.  another transposon insertion mutation was mapped within the soxa orf. four other  independent transposon insertion mutations were mapped in the 4.4-kb soxa contiguous genomic dna region. the results thus suggest that a sox locus of kct001, essential for sulfur oxidation, was affected by all these six independent insertion mutations.

TI  == binding of o(2) and its reduction are both retarded by replacement of valine 279  by isoleucine in cytochrome c oxidase from paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the crystal structure of the heme-copper oxidases suggested a putative channel of oxygen entry into the heme-copper site of o(2) reduction. changing a conserved valine near this center in cytochrome bo(3) of escherichia coli to isoleucine caused a significant increase in the apparent k(m) for oxygen with little or no change in v(max), suggesting that oxygen diffusion had been partially blocked [riistama, s., puustinen, a., garcia-horsman, a., iwata, s., michel, h., and wikstrom, m. (1996) biochim. biophys. acta 1275, 1-4]. to study this phenotype further using rapid kinetic methods, the corresponding change (v279i) has been made in cytochrome aa(3) from paracoccus denitrificans. in this mutant, the apparent k(m) for oxygen is 8 times higher than in the wild-type enzyme, whereas  v(max) is decreased only to approximately half of the wild-type value. flow-flash kinetic measurements show that the initial binding of oxygen to the heme of the binuclear site is indeed much slower in the mutant than in the wild-type enzyme.  however, the subsequent phases of the reaction with o(2) are also slow although the pure heme-to-heme electron transfer process is essentially unperturbed. it is suggested that the mutation sterically hinders o(2) entry into the binuclear site and that it may also perturb the structure of local water molecules involved in proton transfer to this site.

TI  == glutamate-89 in subunit ii of cytochrome bo3 from escherichia coli is required for the function of the heme-copper oxidase.
AB  == recent electrostatics calculations on the cytochrome c oxidase from paracoccus denitrificans revealed an unexpected coupling between the redox state of the heme-copper center and the state of protonation of a glutamic acid (e78ii) that is 25 a away in subunit ii of the oxidase. examination of more than 300 sequences of the homologous subunit in other heme-copper oxidases shows that this residue is virtually totally conserved and is in a cluster of very highly conserved residues at the "negative" end (bacterial cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix) of the second transmembrane helix. the functional importance of several residues in  this cluster (e89ii, w93ii, t94ii, and p96ii) was examined by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding region of the cytochrome bo(3) quinol oxidase from escherichia coli (where e89ii is the equivalent of residue e78ii of the p. denitrificans oxidase). substitution of e89ii with either alanine or glutamine resulted in reducing the rate of turnover to about 43 or 10% of the wild-type value, respectively, whereas e89d has only about 60% of the activity of the control oxidase. the quinol oxidase activity of the w93v mutant is also reduced to about 30% of that of the wild-type oxidase. spectroscopic studies with the purified e89a and e89q mutants indicate no perturbation of the heme-copper center. the data suggest that e89ii (e. coli numbering) is critical for the function of the heme copper oxidases. the proximity to k362 suggests that this glutamic acid residue may regulate proton entry or transit through the k-channel. this hypothesis is supported by the finding that the degree of oxidation of the low-spin heme b is greater in the steady state using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in place of dioxygen for the e89q mutant. thus, it appears that the inhibition resulting from the e89ii mutation is due to a block in the reduction of the heme-copper binuclear center, expected for k-channel mutants.

TI  == paramagnetic nmr studies of blue and purple copper proteins.
AB  == 1h- and 13c-nmr spectroscopy is applied to investigate the cu(a) and type 1 active sites of copper proteins in solution. the analysis of hyperfine shifted 1h resonances allows the comparison of the electron spin density delocalization in the cu(a) site of the wild-type soluble domains of various cytochrome c oxidases  (thermus thermophilus, paracoccus denitrificans, and paracoccus versutus) and genetically engineered constructs (soluble domain of quinol oxidase from escherichia coli and thiobacillus versutus amicyanin). comparable spin densities  are found on the two terminal his ligands for the wild-type constructs as opposed to the engineered proteins where the spin is more unevenly distributed on the two his residues. a reevaluation of the cys h(beta) chemical shifts that is in agreement with the data published for both the p. denitrificans and the p. versutus cu(a) soluble domains confirms the thermal accessibility of the 2b(3u) electronic excited state and indicates the existence of slightly different spin densities on the two bridging cys ligands. the 13c-nmr spectrum of isotopically enriched oxidized azurin from pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals six fast relaxing signals, which can be partially identified by 1- and 2-dimensional (1-d, 2-d) direct detection techniques combined with 3-d triple resonance experiments. the observed contact shifts suggest the presence of direct spin density transfer and  spin polarization mechanisms for the delocalization of the unpaired electron.

TI  == characterization of the putative 2x[4fe-4s]-binding nqo9 subunit of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans. expression, reconstitution, and epr characterization.
AB  == molecular properties of the nqo9 subunit of paracoccus denitrificans ndh-1, which is predicted to contain 2x[4fe-4s] clusters, were investigated using recombinant  expression techniques and epr spectroscopy. the full-length form of nqo9 subunit  co-expressed with thioredoxin in escherichia coli at ambient temperature was found dominantly in the cytoplasmic membrane with low amplification. genetic deletion of relatively hydrophobic and less conserved n-terminal stretches (30 or 40 amino acid residues long) of the nqo9 subunit resulted in the overexpression of the truncated soluble form of the subunit in a high yield in the cytoplasm. the purified soluble form of the nqo9 subunit contained only a small quantity of  fe and s(2-) (2.0-2.2 mol each per mol of subunit). however, the iron-sulfur content was considerably increased by in vitro reconstitution. the reconstituted  nqo9 subunit contained 7.6-7.7 mol each of fe and s(2-) per molecule and exhibited optical absorption spectra similar to those of 2x[4fe-4s] ferredoxins.  two sets of relatively broad axial-type epr signals with different temperature dependence and power saturation profile were detected in the dithionite-reduced preparations at a low temperature range (8-18 k). due to a negative shift (<600 mv) of the apparent redox midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur clusters in the soluble form of the truncated nqo9 subunit, the following two possible cases could not be discriminated: (i) two sets of epr signals arise from two distinct species of tetranuclear iron-sulfur clusters with two intrinsically different spectral parameters g(, perpendicular) = 2.05, approximately 1.93, and g(parallel, perpendicular) = 2.08, approximately 1.90, and respective slow (p((1)/(2)) = 8 milliwatts) and fast (p((1)/(2)) = 342 milliwatts) spin relaxation; (ii) two clusters exhibit similar intrinsic epr spectra (g(parallel,  perpendicular) = 2.05, approximately 1.93) with slow spin relaxation. when both clusters in the same subunit are concomitantly paramagnetic, their spin-spin interactions cause a shift of spectra to g(parallel, perpendicular) = 2.08, approximately 1.90, with enhanced spin relaxation. in either case, our epr data provide the first experimental evidence for the presence of two [4fe-4s] iron-sulfur clusters in the nqo9 subunit.

TI  == the functions of the flavin contact residues, alphaarg249 and betatyr16, in human electron transfer flavoprotein.
AB  == arg249 in the large (alpha) subunit of human electron transfer flavoprotein (etf) heterodimer is absolutely conserved throughout the etf superfamily. the guanidinium group of alphaarg249 is within van der waals contact distance and lies perpendicular to the xylene subnucleus of the flavin ring, near the region proposed to be involved in electron transfer with medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase. the backbone amide hydrogen of alphaarg249 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen at the flavin c(2). alphaarg249 may modulate the potentials of the two flavin redox couples by hydrogen bonding the carbonyl oxygen at c(2) and by providing delocalized positive charge to neutralize the anionic semiquinone and anionic hydroquinone of the flavin. the potentials of the oxidized/semiquinone and semiquinone/hydroquinone couples decrease in an alphar249k mutant etf generated by site directed mutagenesis and expression in escherichia coli, without major alterations of the flavin environment as judged by spectral criteria. the steady state turnover of medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase and glutaryl-coa dehydrogenase decrease greater than 90% as a result of the alphar249ks mutation. in contrast, the steady state turnover of short chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase was decreased about 38% when alphar249k etf was the electron acceptor. stopped flow absorbance measurements of the oxidation of reduced medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase/octenoyl-coa product complex by wild type human etf at 3 degrees c are biphasic (t(1/2)=12 ms and 122  ms). the rate of oxidation of this reduced binary complex of the dehydrogenase by the alphar249k mutant etf is extremely slow and could not be reasonably estimated. alphaasp253 is proposed to function with alphaarg249 in the electron transfer pathway from medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase to etf. the steady state kinetic constants of the dehydrogenase were not altered when etf containing an alphad253a mutant was the substrate. however, t(1/2) of the rapid phase of oxidation of the reduced medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase/octenoyl-coa charge  transfer complex almost doubled. betatyr16 lies on a loop near the c(8) methyl group, and is also near the proposed site for interflavin electron transfer with  medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase. the tyrosine residue makes van der waals contact with the c(8) methyl group of the flavin in human etf and paracoccus denitrificans etf (as betatyr13) and lies at a 30 degrees c angle with the plane  of the flavin. human betatyr16 was substituted with leucine and alanine residues  to investigate the role of this residue in the modulation of the flavin redox potentials and in electron transfer to etf. in betay16l etf, the potentials of the flavin were slightly reduced, and steady state kinetic constants were modestly altered. substitution of an alanine residue for betatyr16 yields an etf  with potentials very similar to the wild type but with steady state kinetic properties similar to betay16l etf. it is unlikely that the beta methyl group of  the alanine residue interacts with the flavin c(8) methyl. neither substitution of betatyr16 had a large effect on the fast phase of etf reduction by medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase.

TI  == mutational analysis of the dimethylsulfoxide respiratory (dor) operon of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == four genes, dorc, dord, dorb and dorr of the dmso respiratory gene cluster of rhodobacter capsulatus have been identified and sequenced. dorc encodes a pentahaem c-type cytochrome of the nirt class and the derived dorc protein sequence shows highest similarity to torc from the escherichia coli trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao) respiratory system. mutagenesis of dorc resulted in the loss of a 46 kda haem-staining polypeptide from membranes of r. capsulatus. dord encodes a protein with highest sequence similarity to tord from the e. coli  tmao respiratory system. dmso reductase polypeptide (dora) could not be detected  in cell-free extracts of a dord mutant and it is suggested that dord has a role in stabilizing the dora apo-protein prior to insertion of the pterin molybdenum cofactor. dorb encodes a protein with highest sequence similarity to napd of paracoccus denitrificans. mutagenesis of dorb reduced the activity of dmso reductase and led to the accumulation of a larger form of the enzyme that is presumed to represent a cytoplasmic precursor polypeptide. it is suggested that dorb has a role in the biogenesis of dmso reductase prior to its secretion into the periplasm. dorr is transcribed in the opposite direction to dorc. the derived amino acid sequence of dorr indicates that it is a response regulator and mutation of dorr shows that it is essential for expression of the dorcda operon.  expression of a chromosomal dora::lacz fusion was also dependent on the transcriptional regulator fnr. the intergenic region between dorr and dorc contains four putative binding sites for dorr but no binding site for fnr was identified.

TI  == heterologous expression of correctly assembled methylamine dehydrogenase in rhodobacter sphaeroides.
AB  == the biosynthesis of methylamine dehydrogenase (madh) from paracoccus denitrificans requires four genes in addition to those that encode the two structural protein subunits, maub and maua. the accessory gene products appear to be required for proper export of the protein to the periplasm, synthesis of the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (ttq) prosthetic group, and formation of several structural disulfide bonds. to accomplish the heterologous expression of correctly assembled madh, eight genes from the methylamine utilization gene cluster of p. denitrificans, maufbedacjg, were placed under the regulatory control of the coxii promoter of rhodobacter sphaeroides and introduced into r. sphaeroides by using a broad-host-range vector. the heterologous expression of madh was constitutive with respect to carbon source, whereas the native mau promoter allows induction only when cells are grown in the presence of methylamine as a sole carbon source and is repressed by other carbon sources. the recombinant madh was localized exclusively in the periplasm, and its physical, spectroscopic, kinetic and redox properties were indistinguishable from those of  the enzyme isolated from p. denitrificans. these results indicate that maum and maun are not required for madh or ttq biosynthesis and that maufbedacjg are sufficient for ttq biosynthesis, since r. sphaeroides cannot synthesize ttq. a similar construct introduced into escherichia coli did not produce detectable madh activity or accumulation of the maub and maua gene products but did lead to  synthesizes of amicyanin, the mauc gene product. this finding suggests that active recombinant madh is not expressed in e. coli because one of the accessory  gene products is not functionally expressed. this study illustrates the potential utility of r. sphaeroides and the coxii promoter for heterologous expression of complex enzymes such as madh which cannot be expressed in e. coli. these results  also provide the foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of madh and ttq biosynthesis, as well as a system for performing site-directed mutagenesis of the madh gene and other mau genes.

TI  == gene dosage effects on polyhydroxyalkanoates synthesis from n-alcohols in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == putative promoters of polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha)-synthetic genes of paracoccus denitrificans were identified. gene dosage effects for pha synthesis were investigated in recombinants of p. denitrificans with increased expression levels of each pha synthetic enzyme. in the cultivation of shake flasks using ethanol or n-pentanol as carbon source, a self-cloning recombinant of the phac-encoding pha  synthase showed the highest contents [(g pha). (g total biomass)-1] and the highest rates of pha accumulation [(g pha). (g residual biomass)-1. h-1] among these recombinants. the pha content and pha accumulation rate (g pha/g residual biomass. h-1) of the self-cloning recombinant was 2 and 2.7 times higher, respectively, than that of the wild strain. this result strongly suggests that the step of pha synthase is limited in in vivo pha synthesis from n-pentanol via  3-ketovaleryl-coa through beta-oxidation, and from ethanol via acetyl-coa. studies on fed-batch cultures keeping the alcohol concentration constant (0.02%)  in a 5-l bioreactor showed that the ability of pha biosynthesis was improved by the gene dosage of pha synthase, although the growth rate of cells during the growth-associated pha synthesis phase was retarded. the molecular weight of the polymer isolated from the strain, dosed by the pha synthase gene, was lower than  that of the polymer from the wild strain, indicating that the amount of pha synthase in vivo affects the molecular weight of the polymer.

AB  == an aminotransferase which catalyzes the final step in methionine recycling from methylthioadenosine, the conversion of alpha-ketomethiobutyrate to methionine, has been purified from klebsiella pneumoniae and characterized. the enzyme was found to be a homodimer of 45-kda subunits, and it catalyzed methionine formation primarily using aromatic amino acids and glutamate as the amino donors. histidine, leucine, asparagine, and arginine were also functional amino donors but to a lesser extent. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined and found to be almost identical to the n-terminal sequence of both the escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium tyrosine aminotransferases (tyrb  gene products). the structural gene for the tyrosine aminotransferase was cloned  from k. pneumoniae and expressed in e. coli. the deduced amino acid sequence displayed 83, 80, 38, and 34% identity to the tyrosine aminotransferases from e.  coli, s. typhimurium, paracoccus denitrificans, and rhizobium meliloti, respectively, but it showed less than 13% identity to any characterized eukaryotic tyrosine aminotransferase. structural motifs around key invariant residues placed the k. pneumoniae enzyme within the ia subfamily of aminotransferases. kinetic analysis of the aminotransferase showed that reactions of an aromatic amino acid with alpha-ketomethiobutyrate and of glutamate with alpha-ketomethiobutyrate proceed as favorably as the well-known reactions of tyrosine with alpha-ketoglutarate and tyrosine with oxaloacetate normally associated with tyrosine aminotransferases. the aminotransferase was inhibited by the aminooxy compounds canaline and carboxymethoxylamine but not by substrate analogues, such as nitrotyrosine or nitrophenylalanine.

AB  == zinc, a common element of adenylate kinases from gram-positive bacteria, binds to a structural motif consisting of three or four cysteine residues, cys-x2-cys-x16-cys-x2-cys/asp. the enzyme from paracoccus denitrificans, a gram-negative bacterium, has structural features much similar to those of adenylate kinases from gram-positive organisms [spurgin, p., tomasselli, a.g., and schiltz, e. (1989) eur. j. biochem., 179, 621-628]. however, adenylate kinase isolated from this bacterium was not reported to bind metal. these findings prompted us to clone the corresponding gene of p. denitrificans, and to characterize the enzyme overproduced in escherichia coli. the deduced primary structure of adenylate kinase from p. denitrificans revealed two differences from that previously published: cys was found at position 130 instead of his, and his  was found at position 138 instead of gly. the recombinant enzyme is a dimer which binds either zinc or iron, in a metal/monomer ratio of one. the dissociating sulfhydryl reagent, p-(hydroxy-mercuri)phenylsulfonate, released the metal from the protein, confirming that thiols are involved in zinc- or iron-binding. the iron-chelated form of recombinant p. denitrificans adenylate kinase, which is essentially under reduced form, transfers electrons to the oxidized cytochrome c. in conclusion, the absence of metal in the enzyme isolated from p. denitrificans  is not related to the protein structure but most probably due to the physiological properties of the host organism.

TI  == characterization of cytochrome c-556 from the purple phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus as a cytochrome-c peroxidase.

AB  == in the cytochrome c oxidases, the role of subunit ii is to provide the electron entry site into the enzyme. this subunit contains both the binding site for the substrate, cytochrome c, and the cua redox center, which is initially reduced by  cytochrome c. cytochrome bo3 and other quinol oxidases that are members of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily have a homologous subunit ii, but the cua site is absent, as is the docking site for cytochrome c. speculation that subunit ii in the quinol oxidases may also be important as an electron entry site is supported  by the demonstration several years ago that a photoreactive substrate analogue, azido-q, covalently labeled subunit ii in cytochrome bo3. in the current work, a  sequence alignment of subunit ii of heme-copper quinol oxidases is used as a guide to select conserved residues that might be important for the binding of ubiquinol to cytochrome bo3. results are presented for point mutants in 24 different residue positions in subunit ii. the membrane-bound enzymes were examined by optical spectroscopy and by determining the activity of ubiquinol-1 oxidase. in each case, the km for ubiquinol-1 was determined as a measure of possible perturbation to a quinol binding site. the only mutant that had a noticeably altered km for ubiquinol-1 was w136a, in which the km was about sixfold increased. thus, w136 may be at or close to a substrate (ubiquinol)-binding site in cytochrome bo3. in the cytochrome c oxidases, the equivalent tryptophan (w121 in paracoccus denitrificans) has been identified as the "electron entry site".

TI  == occurrence, overexpression and partial purification of the protein (majastridin)  corresponding to the urf6 gene of the rhodobacter blasticus atp operon.
AB  == antibodies were produced against two antigenic peptides of a protein, which was named majastridin, corresponding to the urf6 gene of the rhodobacter blasticus atp operon [tybulewicz, v. l. j., falk, g. & walker, j. e. (1984) j. mol. biol. 179, 185-214]. a protein band of the expected size is labelled by immunoblotting  in western blots containing the cytosolic fractions from rb. blasticus and paracoccus denitrificans but not from escherichia coli or rhodospirillum rubrum.  although the protein is present during the entire life cycle of a rb. blasticus culture, it is most abundant early during the stationary phase. plasmid constructs of the urf6 gene for overexpression in e. coli were made. these constructs were designed to obtain proteins both with and without his-tagging. in both cases, a protein product was visible in induced cells. the his-tagged protein was purified to 85% on a ni column and, further, to at least 95% by anion-exchange chromatography. by n-terminal sequencing of the his-tagged protein, its identity was confirmed.

TI  == role of copper during carbon monoxide binding to terminal oxidases.
AB  == under fully reduced conditions, reassociation kinetics of co were studied in several terminal oxidases containing copper in their binuclear center. the purified paracoccus denitrificans ba3-type quinol oxidase was found to recombine  with co monophasically (tau 25-30 ms) like oxidases of the bo type from escherichia coli, the caa3 type from bacillus halodurans ftu, and the bo type from methylobacillus flagellatum kt. oxidase of the aa3 type from bovine heart recombined with co monophasically at a higher rate (tau 16-19 ms) than the studied copper-containing bacterial oxidases. after prolonged incubation in the presence of co, oxidases of the ba3 and aa3 types changed their co-binding properties. the contribution of the slow component was diminished while new fast  components arose. measurement of the metal content in the oxidases indicated that during the incubation, the enzymes lost their copper, the process being accompanied by the appearance of a fast co recombination rate resembling that of  the non-copper oxidases of the bd type from e. coli and the bb type from bacillus halodurans ftu. this points to a role of copper in co binding by terminal oxidases.

TI  == iron-sulfur clusters/semiquinones in complex i.
AB  == nadh-quinone 1 oxidoreductase (complex i) isolated from bovine heart mitochondria was, until recently, the major source for the study of this most complicated energy transducing device in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. complex i has been shown to contain 43 subunits and possesses a molecular mass of about 1 million. recently, complex i genes have been cloned and sequenced from several bacterial sources including escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, rhodobacter capsulatus and thermus thermophilus hb-8. these enzymes are less complicated than the bovine enzyme, containing a core of 13 or 14 subunits homologous to the bovine heart complex i. from this data, important clues concerning the subunit location of both the substrate binding site and intrinsic  redox centers have been gleaned. powerful molecular genetic approaches used in these bacterial systems can identify structure/function relationships concerning  the redox components of complex i. site-directed mutants at the level of bacterial chromosomes and over-expression and purification of single subunits have allowed detailed analysis of the amino acid residues involved in ligand binding to several iron-sulfur clusters. therefore, it has become possible to examine which subunits contain individual iron-sulfur clusters, their location within the enzyme and what their ligand residues are. the discovery of g=2.00 epr signals arising from two distinct species of semiquinone (sq) in the activated bovine heart submitochondrial particles (smp) is another line of recent progress. the intensity of semiquinone signals is sensitive to deltamicroh+ and is diminished by specific inhibitors of complex i. to date, semiquinones similar to  those reported for the bovine heart mitochondrial complex i have not yet been discovered in the bacterial systems. this mini-review describes three aspects of  the recent progress in the study of the redox components of complex i: (a) the location of the substrate (nadh) binding site, flavin, and most of the iron-sulfur clusters, which have been identified in the hydrophilic electron entry domain of complex i; (b) experimental evidence indicating that the cluster  n2 is located in the amphipathic domain of complex i, connecting the promontory and membrane parts. very recent data is also presented suggesting that the cluster n2 may have a unique ligand structure with an atypical cluster-ligation sequence motif located in the nuob (nqo6/psst) subunit rather than in the long advocated nuoi (nqo9/tyky) subunit. the latter subunit contains the most primordial sequence motif for two tetranuclear clusters; (c) the discovery of spin-spin interactions between cluster n2 and two distinct complex i-associated species of semiquinone. based on the splitting of the g1 signal of the cluster n2 and concomitant strong enhancement of the semiquinone spin relaxation, one semiquinone species was localized 8-11 a from the cluster n2 within the inner membrane on the matrix side (n-side). spin relaxation of the other semiquinone species is much less enhanced, and thus it was proposed to have a longer distance from the cluster n2, perhaps located closer to the other side (p-side) surface of the membrane. a brief introduction of epr technique was also described in appendix a of this mini-review.

TI  == purification and characterization of the hnda subunit of nadp-reducing hydrogenase from desulfovibrio fructosovorans overproduced in escherichia coli.
AB  == based on the dna sequence of its structural genes, clustered in the hnd operon, the nadp-reducing hydrogenase of desulfovibrio fructosovorans is thought to be a  heterotetrameric complex in which hnda and hndc constitute the nadp-reducing unit and hndd constitutes the hydrogenase unit, respectively. the weak representativity of the enzyme among cell proteins has prevented its purification. this paper discusses the purification and characterization of the hnda subunit of this unique tetrameric iron hydrogenase overproduced in escherichia coli. the purified subunit contains 1.7 mol of non-heme iron and 1.7  mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol. epr analysis of the reduced form of hnda indicates that it contains a single binuclear [2fe-2s] cluster. this cluster exhibits a spectrum of rhombic symmetry with values of gx, gy, and gz equal to 1.915, 1.950, and 2. 000, respectively, and a midpoint redox potential of -395 mv. the uv-visible and epr spectra of the [2fe-2s] cluster indicate that hnda belongs to the [2fe-2s] family typified by the clostridium pasteurianum [2fe-2s]  ferredoxin. the c-terminal sequence of hnda shows 27% identity with the c-terminal sequence of the 25-kda subunit of nadh: quinone oxidoreductase from paracoccus denitrificans, 33% identity with the c-terminal sequence of the 24-kda subunit from bos taurus complex i, and 32% identity with the entire sequence of c. pasteurianum [2fe-2s] ferredoxin. the four cysteine residues involved in hnda  cluster binding have been tentatively identified on the basis of sequence identity considerations. evidence of a hnda organization based on two independent structural domains is discussed.

TI  == identification of the contiguous paracoccus denitrificans ccmf and ccmh genes: disruption of ccmf, encoding a putative transporter, results in formation of an unstable apocytochrome c and deficiency in siderophore production.
AB  == apocytochrome c550 was detected in the periplasm of a new mutant of paracoccus denitrificans, hn48, that is pleiotropically lacking c-type cytochromes, produces reduced levels of siderophores and carries a tn5 insertion in the ccmf gene for which sequence data, along with that for the contiguous ccmh, are reported. a counterpart to the ccmf gene was found in an archaebacterium but could not be located in the yeast genome, whereas mitochondrial haem lyases in the latter were not present in an archaeobacterial or in eubacterial genomes. a topological analysis for ccmf is presented which indicates at least eleven transmembrane helices, suggesting a role as a transporter; evidence against the substrate being haem is presented but sequence similarity with escherichia coli gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter was identified. analysis by pulse-chase methodology has shown that, in this and another cytochrome-c-deficient mutant, the apo form of p. denitrificans cytochrome c550 is much less stable than the holo form, directly demonstrating the presence of a periplasmic degradation system in p. denitrificans that removes non-functional proteins. a variety of phenotypes are observed for p. denitrificans mutated in different ccm genes, thus indicating that the stability of the ccm gene products does not require assembly  of a complex of all the ccm proteins.

TI  == heterologous expression of heterotrophic nitrification genes.
AB  == paracoccus denitrificans is a heterotrophic organism capable of oxidizing ammonia to nitrite during growth on an organic carbon and energy source. this pathway, termed heterotrophic nitrification, requires the concerted action of an ammonia monooxygenase (amo) and hydroxylamine oxidase (hao). the genes required for heterotrophic nitrification have been isolated by introducing a pa. denitrificans genomic library into pseudomonas putida and screening for the accumulation of nitrite. in contrast to the situation in chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers, the genes encoding amo and hao are present in single linked copies in the genome  of pa. denitrificans. amo from pa. denitrificans expressed in ps. putida is capable of oxidizing ethene (ethylene) to epoxyethane (ethylene oxide), which is  indicative of a relaxed substrate specificity. further, when expressed in the methylotroph methylobacterium extorquens am1, the amo endows on this organism the ability to grow on ethene and methane. thus, the pa. denitrificans amo is capable of oxidizing methane to methanol, as is the case for the amo from nitrosomonas europaea. the heterotrophic nitrification genes are moderately toxic in m. extorquens, more toxic in ps. putida, and non-toxic in escherichia coli. toxicity is due to the activity of the gene products in m. extorquens, and both expression and activity in ps. putida. this is the first time that the genes encoding an active amo have been expressed in a heterologous host.

TI  == factors which stabilize the methylamine dehydrogenase-amicyanin electron transfer protein complex revealed by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  == methylamine dehydrogenase (madh) and amicyanin form a physiologic complex within  which electrons are transferred from the tryptophan tryptophylquinone (ttq) cofactor of madh to the type 1 copper of amicyanin. interactions responsible for  complex formation may be inferred from the crystal structures of complexes of these proteins. site-directed mutagenesis has been performed to probe the roles of specific amino acid residues of amicyanin in stabilizing the madh-amicyanin complex and determining the observed ionic strength dependence of complex formation. conversion of phe97 to glu severely disrupted binding, establishing the importance of hydrophobic interactions involving this residue. conversion of  arg99 to either asp or to leu increased the kd for complex formation by 2 orders  of magnitude at low ionic strength, establishing the importance of ionic interactions which were inferred from the crystal structure involving arg99. conversion of lys68 to ala did not disrupt binding at low ionic strength, but it  did greatly diminish the observed ionic strength dependence of complex formation  that is seen with wild-type amicyanin. these results demonstrate that the physiologic interaction between madh and amicyanin is stabilized by a combination of ionic and van der waals interactions and that individual amino acid residues on the protein surface are able to dictate specific interactions between these soluble redox proteins. these results also indicate that the orientation of madh  and amicyanin when they react with each other in solution is the same as the orientation of the proteins which is seen in the structure of the crystallized protein complex.

TI  == structural characterization of paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c peroxidase and assignment of the low and high potential heme sites.
AB  == the amino acid sequence of the diheme cytochrome c peroxidase from paracoccus denitrificans has been determined as the result of sequence analysis of peptides  generated by chemical and enzymatic cleavages of the apoprotein. the sequence shows 60% similarity to the cytochrome c peroxidase from pseudomonas aeruginosa,  39% similarity to an open reading frame encoding a putative triheme c-type cytochrome in escherichia coli, and remote similarity to the maug proteins from two methylotrophic bacteria. it is proposed, on the basis of the pattern of conserved residues in the sequences, that a change in iron coordination in the n-terminal heme domain may accompany reduction to the active mixed valence state, a change which may be accompanied by conformational adjustments in the highly conserved interface between the n- and c-terminal domains. these conformational adjustments may also lead to the appearance of a second ca2+ binding site in the  mixed valence enzyme. the exposed edge of the heme in the c-terminal domain is surrounded by several different patterns of charged residues in the paracoccus and pseudomonas enzymes, and this is consistent with the interaction of the former with the highly positively charged front face of the donor cytochrome c-550.

TI  == paracoccus denitrificans ccmg is a periplasmic protein-disulphide oxidoreductase  required for c- and aa3-type cytochrome biogenesis; evidence for a reductase role in vivo.
AB  == cloning and sequencing of the paracoccus denitrificans ccmg gene indicates that it codes for a periplasmic protein-disulphide oxidoreductase; the presence of the sequence cys-pro-pro-cys at the ccmg active site suggests that it may act in vivo to reduce disulphide bonds rather than to form them. a ccmg-phoa fusion confirmed the periplasmic location. disruption of the ccmg gene resulted in not only the expected phenotype of pleiotropic deficiency in c-type cytochromes, but also loss of spectroscopically detectable cytochrome aa3, cytochrome c oxidase and ascorbate/tmpd oxidase activities; there was also an enhanced sensitivity to growth inhibition by some component of rich media and by oxidized thiol compounds. dithiothreitol promoted the growth of the ccmg mutant on rich media and substantially restored spectroscopically detectable cytochrome aa3 and cytochrome c oxidase activity, although it did not restore c-type cytochrome biogenesis. assembly of the disulphide-bridged proteins methanol dehydrogenase and escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase was unaffected in the ccmg mutant. it is proposed that p. denitrificans ccmg acts in vivo to reduce protein-disulphide  bonds in certain protein substrates including c-type cytochrome polypeptides and/or polypeptides involved in c-type cytochrome biogenesis.

TI  == alphat244m mutation affects the redox, kinetic, and in vitro folding properties of paracoccus denitrificans electron transfer flavoprotein.
AB  == threonine 244 in the alpha subunit of paracoccus denitrificans transfer flavoprotein (etf) lies seven residues to the amino terminus of a proposed dinucleotide binding motif for the adp moiety of the fad prosthetic group. this residue is highly conserved in the alpha subunits of all known etfs, and the most frequent pathogenic mutation in human etf encodes a methionine substitution at the corresponding position, alphat266. the x-ray crystal structures of human and  p. denitrificans etfs are very similar. the hydroxyl hydrogen and a backbone amide hydrogen of alphat266 are hydrogen bonded to n(5) and c(4)o of the flavin,  respectively, and the corresponding alphat244 has the same structural role in p.  denitrificans etf. we substituted a methionine for t244 in the alpha subunit of p. denitrificans etf and expressed the mutant etf in escherichia coli. the mutant protein was purified, characterized, and compared with wild type p. denitrificans etf. the mutation has no significant effect on the global structure of the protein as inferred from visible and near-ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism spectra, far-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra, and infrared spectra in 1h2o and 2h2o. intrinsic fluorescence due to tryptophan of the mutant  protein is 60% greater than that of the wild type etf. this increased tryptophan  fluorescence is probably due to a change in the environment of the nearby w239. tyrosine fluorescence is unchanged in the mutant protein, although two tyrosine residues are close to the site of the mutation. these results indicate that a change in structure is minor and localized. kinetic constants of the reductive half-reaction of etf with porcine medium chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase are unaltered when alphat244m etf serves as the substrate; however, the mutant etf fails to exhibit saturation kinetics when the semiquinone form of the protein is  used as the substrate in the disproportionation reaction catalyzed by p. denitrificans electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (etf-qo).  the redox behavior of the mutant etf was also altered as determined from the equilibrium constant of the disproportionation reaction. the separation of flavin redox potentials between the oxidized/semiquinone couple and semiquinone/hydroquinone couple are -6 mv in the wild type etf and -27 mv in the  mutant etf. the mutation does not alter the amp content of the protein, although  the extent and fidelity of amp-dependent, in vitro renaturation of the mutant amp-free apoetf is reduced by 57% compared to renaturation of wild type apoetf, likely due to the absence of the potential hydrogen bond donor t244.

TI  == expression of the mau gene cluster of paracoccus denitrificans is controlled by maur and a second transcription regulator.
AB  == the mau gene cluster of paracoccus denitrificans constitutes 11 genes (10 are located in the transcriptional order maufbedacjgmn; the 11th, maur, is located upstream and divergently transcribed from these genes) that encode a functional methylamine-oxidizing electron transport branch. the maur gene encodes a lysr-type transcriptional activator essential for induction of the mau operon. in this study, the characteristics of that process were established. by using lacz transcriptional fusions integrated into the genome of p. denitrificans, it was found that the expression of the maur gene during growth on methylamine and/or succinate was not autoregulated, but proceeded at a low and constant level. the mauf promoter activity was shown to be controlled by maur and a second transcriptional regulator. this activity was very high during growth on methylamine, low on succinate plus methylamine, and absent on succinate alone. maur was overexpressed in escherichia coli by using a t7 rna polymerase expression system. gel shift assays indicated that maur binds to a 403 bp dna fragment spanning the maur-mauf promoter region. it is concluded from these results that the expression of the structural mau genes is dependent on maur and  its inducer, methylamine, as well as on another transcription factor. both activators are required for high-level transcription from the mauf promoter. it is hypothesized that the two activators act synergistically to activate transcription: the effects of the two activators are not additive and either one  alone activates the mauf promoter rather weakly.

TI  == fnrp and nnr of paracoccus denitrificans are both members of the fnr family of transcriptional activators but have distinct roles in respiratory adaptation in response to oxygen limitation.
AB  == the paracoccus denitrificans fnrp gene encoding a homologue of the escherichia coli fnr protein was localized upstream of the gene cluster that encodes the high-affinity cbb3-type oxidase. fnrp harbours the invariant cysteine residues that are supposed to be the ligands of the redox-sensitive [4fe-4s] cluster in fnr. nnr, another fnr-like transcriptional regulator in p. denitrificans, does not. analysis of fnrp and nnr single and double mutants revealed that the two regulators each exert exclusive control on the expression of a discrete set of target genes. in fnrp mutants, the expression of cytochrome c peroxidase was blocked, that of membrane-bound nitrate reductase and the cbb3-type oxidase was significantly reduced, whilst the activity of the bb3-type quinol oxidase was increased. the amounts of the nitrite and nitric oxide reductases in these fnrp mutants were the same as in the wild type. nnr mutants, on the other hand, were disturbed exclusively in the concentrations of nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase. an fnrp.nnr double mutant combined the phenotypes of the single mutant strains. in all three mutants, the concentrations and/or activities of the aa3-type oxidase, cytochrome c550, cytochrome c552, and nitrous oxide reductase equalled those in the wild type. as the fnr boxes in front of the fnrp- and nnr-regulated genes are highly similar to or even identical to each other, the absence of cross-talk between the regulation by fnrp and nnr implies that as yet  unidentified factors are important in the control. it is proposed that the redox  state of an intracellular redox couple other than the oxygen/water couple is one  of the factors that modulates the activity of fnrp.

AB  == the genes encoding the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of a thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus hb-8 were cloned and sequenced.  they constitute a cluster that is composed of 14 structural genes and contains no unidentified reading frames. all of the 14 structural genes, which are designated nqo1-14, encode subunits homologous to those of paracoccus denitrificans ndh-1, respectively, and are arranged in the same order as other bacterial ndh-1 genes.  t. thermophilus ndh-1 contains at most nine putative iron-sulfur cluster binding  sites, eight of which are commonly found in other organisms. the t. thermophilus  nqo2 subunit was expressed in escherichia coli. the expressed subunit bears a single [2fe-2s] cluster whose optical and epr properties are very similar to those of n1a cluster in the p. denitrificans nqo2 subunit (yano, t., sled', v.d., ohnishi, t., and yagi, t. (1994) biochemistry 33, 494-499). these results strongly suggest that the t. thermophilus ndh-1 is similar to other ndh-1 enzyme  complexes in terms of subunit and cofactor composition. the t. thermophilus nqo2  subunit displayed much higher stability than the mesophilic equivalent and its iron-sulfur cluster remained intact even after incubation for 3 h at 65 degrees c under anaerobic conditions. with the advantage of thermostability, the t. thermophilus ndh-1 provides a great model system to investigate the structure-function relationship of the ndh-1 enzyme complexes.

TI  == emerging principles of inorganic nitrogen metabolism in paracoccus denitrificans  and related bacteria.
AB  == the taxonomy of paracoccus denitrificans and related bacteria is discussed. evidence is given which shows that the physiological differences between p. denitrificans and thiosphaera pantotropha are less fundamental than previously thought. a proposal to consider a species p. pantotropha is mentioned. the properties of the denitrifying enzymes and the genes involved in their formation  in p. denitrificans is discussed. the synthesis of the membrane-bound-nitrate reductase is regulated by fnr, that of the nitrite- and nitric oxide reductase by nnr. evidence is given that fnr acts as a redox sensor rather than an oxygen sensor. the occurrence of aerobic denitrification and coupled heterotrophic nitrification-denitrification in the original strain of thiosphaera pantotropha are explained by a limiting respiratory activity which activates fnr. aerobic denitrification leads to a lower growth yield and an increase in mumax in batch culture when a limiting respiratory activity is assumed and when excess substrate is present. coupled heterotrophic nitrification-denitrification gives a smaller increase in mumax and a more drastic reduction in yield. both processes are thus  advantageous to the organism. in a chemostat with limiting substrate these processes are disadvantageous. t. pantotropha has lost the ability for aerobic denitrification during extended cultivation. possibly the substrate concentration was limiting during extended cultivation giving a selective advantage to variants which have lost these properties. the calculations predict that p. denitrificans  should be able to grow chemolithotrophically with hydroxylamine.

(1991) biotechnol. appl. biochem. 13, 112-119]. the enzyme (pdarat) was purified to homogeneity, and characterized. it was similar to aspartate aminotransferase (aspat) and arat of e. coli (ecarat) in many respects, including gross protein structure and spectroscopic properties. pdarat showed activities toward both dicarboxylic and aromatic substrates, and analysis of the binding of substrate analogs and quasisubstrates to the enzyme showed that both dicarboxylic and aromatic substrates take a similar orientation  in the active site of pdarat; these properties are essentially identical with those of ecarat. as in the case of ecarat, neutral amino acids with larger side chains are better substrates for pdarat, suggesting that hydrophobic interaction  between the substrate and the enzyme is important for the recognition of substrates with neutral side chains. pdarat catalyzed transamination of phenylalanine and tyrosine far more efficiently (10(2)-fold in terms of kcat/km)  than those of straight-chain aliphatic amino acids with similar side-chain surface area, whereas ecarat did not show significant preference for aromatic amino acids over aliphatic amino acids. this shows that the substrate-side-chain-binding pocket of pdarat, as compared with the pocket of ecarat, is well suited in shape for interaction with the phenyl and hydroxyphenyl rings of substrates. thus, pdarat is an ideal enzyme among arats for the study of the high-specificity recognition of two different kinds of substrates, the one having a carboxylic side chain and the other having an aromatic side chain.

TI  == cytochrome bo from escherichia coli: binding of azide to cub.
AB  == azide binds to fast cytochrome bo with a stoichiometry of 1:1, the dissociation constant for this reaction being approximately 2 x 10(-5) m. the changes induced  in the electronic absorption are very slight and are consistent with heme o remaining hexacoordinate high-spin, an observation confirmed by room temperature  mcd spectroscopy in the region 350-2000 nm. x-band epr spectroscopy of the azide-bound form shows heme o remains coupled to cub, but that the integer spin signal (g = 3.7) that we have previously reported to be associated with the binuclear center of fast cytochrome bo [watmough et al. (1993) febs lett. 319, 151-154], is shifted to higher field. the kinetics of azide binding are an order  of magnitude faster than those observed for the binding of cyanide. unlike cyanide, the observed rate constants do not saturate in the range 0.05-25 mm. the value of kon shows a marked dependence on ph, indicating that the active species  is hydrazoic acid. it is argued that these data are consistent with the binding of azide ion as a terminal ligand to cub yielding a binuclear center in the form  feiii-oh2:: cubii-n3. the binding of azide in heme-copper oxidases may cause displacement of another nitrogenous ligand from cub which might explain the absence of electron density associated with histidine-325 in the structure of the paracoccus denitrificans cco [iwata et al. (1995) nature 376, 660-669]. formate appears to act as a bidentate ligand to the binuclear center-, blocking not only  the binding of azide to cub but also the binding of cyanide to heme o.

TI  == genetic inactivation of the h(+)-translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase of  paracoccus denitrificans is facilitated by insertion of the ndh gene from escherichia coli.
AB  == the h(+)-translocating nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ndh1) is probably an obligatory enzyme in paracoccus denitrificans and disruption of its genes may be  lethal to this organism. in order to overcome this problem and delete the nqo8 and nqo9 genes of ndh1, it was necessary to render the enzyme non-essential. this was achieved by constructing a deletion plasmid in which most of the coding regions of nqo8 and nqo9 were replaced by the ndh gene of escherichia coli that encodes an alternative nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ndh2), and a kanamycin resistance gene. subsequent homologous recombination gave rise to a mutant the membranes of which catalyzed rotenone-insensitive nadh oxidation, but which did not oxidize deamino-nadh. hence, this mutant expressed active and membrane-bound  ndh2, and lacked ndh1 activity.

TI  == cytochrome c550 expression in paracoccus denitrificans strongly depends on growth condition: identification of promoter region for cyca by transcription start analysis.
AB  == the periplasmic cytochrome c550 content of paracoccus denitrificans has been shown by immunological detection to be strongly dependent on the mode of growth.  cells grown under anaerobic, denitrifying conditions or methylotrophically in the presence of oxygen contained substantially more cytochrome c550 than cells grown  aerobically on multicarbon substrates. a similar pattern was observed when expression of the cyca gene (encoding cytochrome c550), was monitored using an escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase gene (phoa) fusion as a reporter of cyca promoter activity. the increase in cyca expression observed during growth on c1 substrates was substantially diminished if succinate was also present. these results reveal that expression of cyca is subject to multiple regulatory controls and suggest that cytochrome c550 has a general role in electron transfer to periplasmic reductases required for anaerobic denitrifying growth and from dehydrogenases required for aerobic growth on c1 compounds. two major transcriptional initiation start points for the cyca gene have been identified.

TI  == structural studies of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans: identity, property, and stoichiometry of the peripheral subunits.
AB  == the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans is composed of at least 14 unlike subunits and contains one fmn and at least five epr-detectable iron-sulfur clusters. the 14 subunits are designated nqo1 through nqo14. the expression and partial characterization of the nqo4, -5,  and -6 subunits have been performed. the nqo4, -5, and -6 subunits were individually expressed in escherichia coli. the nqo4 subunit was expressed in both the cytoplasmic phase and membrane fraction, the nqo5 subunit in the cytoplasmic phase only, and the nqo6 subunit in the membrane fraction only. the nqo4 and nqo5 subunits were purified from cytoplasmic phase. neither subunit contains non-heme iron or acid-labile sulfide, suggesting that the nqo4 or nqo5 subunit is not an iron-sulfur subunit. the antibodies against the nqo4, -5, and -6 subunits cross-reacted with their counterpart subunits in bovine heart complex i. the nqo4, -5, and -6 subunits in membrane-bound p. denitrificans ndh-1 were extracted by treatment at alkaline ph ( > or = 10) or with chaotropes (nabr, nal, and urea), suggesting that these subunits are localized in the peripheral part (not in the membrane sector) of the enzyme complex similar to the nqo1, -2, and -3 subunits. in addition, the subunit stoichiometry of nqo1 through -6 of the membrane-bound p. denitrificans ndh-1 has been determined by radioimmunoassays. there is 1 mol each of the nqo1 through -6 subunits per mol of the p. denitrificans ndh-1.

TI  == the rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 rho gene: expression and genetic analysis of structure and function.
AB  == the gene which encodes transcription termination factor rho from rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1, the gram-negative facultative photosynthetic bacterium, has been cloned and sequenced. the deduced protein shows a high level of sequence similarity to other bacterial rho factors, especially those from proteobacteria.  however, several amino acid substitutions in the conserved atp-binding site have  been identified. when expressed in escherichia coli, the r. sphaeroides rho gene  relieves rho-dependent polarity of the trp operon, indicating interference with the transcription termination machinery of e. coli. a truncated version of r. sphaeroides rho (rho') is toxic to a bacterium related to r. sphaeroides, paracoccus denitrificans, and is lethal to r. sphaeroides. we suggest that toxicity is due to the ability of rho' to form inactive heteromers with the chromosomally encoded intact rho. we localized a minimal amino acid sequence within rho which appears to be critical for its toxic effect and which we believe may be involved in protein-protein interactions. this region was previously reported to be highly conserved and unique among various rho proteins. the lethality of rho' in r. sphaeroides together with our inability to obtain a null  mutation in rho suggests that rho-dependent transcription termination is essential in r. sphaeroides. this is analogous to what is observed for gram-negative e. coli and contrasts with what is observed for gram-positive bacillus subtilis. the genetic region surrounding the r. sphaeroides rho gene has been determined and found to be different compared with those of other bacterial  species. rho is preceded by orf1, which encodes a putative integral membrane protein possibly involved in cytochrome formation or functioning. the gene downstream of rho is homologous to thdf, whose product is involved in thiophene and furan oxidation.

AB  == a 17.6 kb dna fragment from the right arm of chromosome vii of saccharomyces cerevisiae has been sequenced and analysed. the sequence contains twelve open reading frames (orfs) longer than 100 amino acids. three genes had already been cloned and sequenced: cct, ade3 and tr-i. two orfs are similar to other yeast genes: g7722 with the yal023 (pmt2) and pmt1 genes, encoding two integral membrane proteins, and g7727 with the first half of the genes encoding elongation factors 1gamma, tef3 and tef4. two other orfs, g7742 and g7744, are most probably yeast orthologues of the human and paracoccus denitrificans electron-transferring flavoproteins (beta chain) and of the escherichia coli phosphoserine phosphohydrolase. the five remaining identified orfs do not show detectable homology with other protein sequences deposited in data banks. the sequence has been deposited in the embl data library under accession number z49133.

TI  == expression and characterization of the flavoprotein subcomplex composed of 50-kda (nqo1) and 25-kda (nqo2) subunits of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase of paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == this study reports the expression of the flavoprotein (fp) subcomplex of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) from paracoccus denitrificans, which is composed of the nqo1 (50 kda) and the nqo2 (25 kda) subunits. the two subunits are co-expressed in escherichia coli using a double expression plasmid system. the expressed subunits form a water-soluble heterodimer complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. the expressed complex contained one [2fe 2s] cluster but almost no fmn or [4fe 4s] cluster. the two latter prosthetic groups could be partially reconstituted with fmn, na2s, and (nh4)2fe(so4)2 in vitro under anaerobic conditions. the reconstituted fp subcomplex showed epr signals from two distinct species of iron-sulfur cluster. one resonance transition originates from a [2fe-2s] cluster with g values of gx,y,z = 1.92, 1.95, and 2.00 and slow spin relaxation, which was tentatively assigned to the cluster n1a. these epr properties are very similar to those reported for the nqo2 subunit expressed alone (yano, t., sled', v. d., ohnishi, t., and yagi, t. (1994) biochemistry 33, 494-499). the other originates from a [4fe 4s] cluster with g values of gx,y, z = 1.87, 1.94, and 2.04 and fast relaxing behavior, which are reminiscent of the cluster n3 in the membrane bound enzyme complex. after reconstitution with fmn, the fp subcomplex catalyzed electron transfer from nadh  and from deamino-nadh to a variety of electron acceptors. the enzymatic properties of the fp subcomplex, reconstituted with fmn and iron-sulfur, correspond to those of the isolated p. denitrificans nadh-dehydrogenase complex.

TI  == alteration of haem-attachment and signal-cleavage sites for paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c550 probes pathway of c-type cytochrome biogenesis in escherichia coli.
AB  == paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c550 is expressed as a periplasmic holo-protein in escherichia coli; amino acid substitutions of cysteine residues in the haem-binding motif (cys-x-x-cys-his), either together or singly, prevented covalent attachment of haem but not polypeptide translocation into the periplasm. when the three alanine residues at positions -3 to -1 in the native signal-cleavage site were deleted, or alanine at -1 was changed to glutamine, signal cleavage was at alternative sites (after only ten residues in the latter case), but haem attachment still occurred. when the same three alanines were changed to asp-glu-asp, a membrane-associated apo product that had retained the complete signal sequence was detected. these and other results presented here indicate that (i) haem attachment is not required for the apo-cytochrome c550 export to the periplasm; (ii) haem cannot attach to apo-cytochrome c550 when attached to the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that signal-sequence cleavage precedes periplasmic haem attachment, which can occur at as few as six residues from the mature n-terminus; and (iii) two cysteines are required for haem attachment, possibly because a disulphide bond is an intermediate. the gene for saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial iso-1-cytochrome c was expressed as a holo-protein in e. coli when fused with the signal sequence plus the first 10 residues of the mature cytochrome c550, indicating that the e. coli cellular apparatus for the c-type cytochrome biogenesis has a broad substrate specificity.

TI  == bradyrhizobium japonicum possesses two discrete sets of electron transfer flavoprotein genes: fixa, fixb and etfs, etfl.
AB  == a group of four co-regulated genes (fixa, fixb, fixc, fixx) essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation has been described in several rhizobial species, including bradyrhizobium japonicum. the complete nucleotide sequence of the b. japonicum fixa, fixb and fixc, genes is reported here. the derived amino acid sequences confirmed the previously noted sequence similarity between fixa and the beta-subunit and between fixb and the alpha-subunit of mammalian and paracoccus denitrificans electron transfer flavoproteins (etf). since the classical role of  etf is in beta-oxidation of fatty acids, a process unrelated to nitrogen fixation, we rationalized that b. japonicum ought to contain bona fide etf genes  in addition to the etf-like genes fixa and fixb. therefore, we identified, cloned, sequenced, and transcriptionally analyzed the b. japonicum etfsl genes encoding the beta- and alpha-subunits of etf. the etfsl genes, but not the fix genes, are transcribed in aerobically grown cells. an amino acid sequence comparison between all available etfs and etf-like proteins revealed the existence of two distinguishable subfamilies. group i comprises housekeeping etfs that link acyl-coa dehydrogenase reactions with the respiratory chain, such as in the fatty acid degradation pathway. b. japonicum etfs and etfl clearly belong to  this group. group ii contains etf-like proteins that are synthesized only under certain specific growth conditions and receive electrons from the oxidation of specific substrates. the products of the anaerobically induced fixa and fixb genes of b. japonicum are members of that group. b. japonicum is the first example of an organism in which genes for proteins of both groups i and ii of the etf family have been identified.

AB  == a 3.6-kb ecori-sali fragment of paracoccus denitrificans dna hybridized with a dna probe carrying the poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (pha) synthase gene (phac) of alcaligenes eutrophus. nucleotide sequence analysis of this region showed the presence of a 1,872-bp open reading frame (orf), which corresponded to a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 69,537. upstream of the orf, a promoter-like sequence was found. escherichia coli carrying the fusion gene between lacz and the orf accumulated a level of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) that was  as much as 20 wt% of the cell dry weight in the presence of beta-ketothiolase and acetoacetylcoenzyme a reductase genes of a. eutrophus. the orf was designated phacpd. a plasmid vector carrying the phacpd'-'lacz fusion gene downstream of the promoter-like sequence expressed beta-galactosidase activity in p. denitrificans. when a multicopy and broad-host-range vector carrying the orf along with the promoter-like sequence was introduced into p. denitrificans, the pha content in the cells increased by twofold compared with cells carrying only a vector sequence.

TI  == crystal structure of the membrane-exposed domain from a respiratory quinol oxidase complex with an engineered dinuclear copper center.
AB  == cytochrome oxidase is a membrane protein complex that catalyzes reduction of molecular oxygen to water and utilizes the free energy of this reaction to generate a transmembrane proton gradient during respiration. the electron entry site in subunit ii is a mixed-valence dinuclear copper center in enzymes that oxidize cytochrome c. this center has been lost during the evolution of the quinoloxidizing branch of cytochrome oxidases but can be restored by engineering. herein we describe the crystal structures of the periplasmic fragment from the wild-type subunit ii (cyoa) of escherichia coli quinol oxidase at 2.5-a resolution and of the mutant with the engineered dinuclear copper center (purple  cyoa) at 2.3-a resolution. cyoa is folded as an 11-stranded mostly antiparallel beta-sandwich followed by three alpha-helices. the dinuclear copper center is located at the loops between strands beta 5-beta 6 and beta 9-beta 10. the two coppers are at a 2.5-a distance and symmetrically coordinated to the main ligands that are two bridging cysteines and two terminal histidines. the residues that are distinct in cytochrome c and quinol oxidases are around the dinuclear copper  center. structural comparison suggests a common ancestry for subunit ii of cytochrome oxidase and blue copper-binding proteins.

TI  == expression and characterization of the 66-kilodalton (nqo3) iron-sulfur subunit of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase of paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans is composed of at least 14 dissimilar subunits which are designated nqo1-14 and contains one noncovalently bound fmn and at least five epr-visible iron-sulfur clusters (n1a, n1b, n2, n3, and n4) as prosthetic groups. comparison  of the deduced primary structures of the subunits with consensus sequences for the cofactor binding sites has predicted that nqo1, nqo2, nqo3, nqo9, and probably nqo6 subunits are cofactor binding subunits. previously, we have reported that the nqo2 (25 kda) subunit was overexpressed as a water-soluble protein in escherichia coli and was found to ligate a single [2fe-2s] cluster with rhombic symmetry (gx,y,z = 1.92, 1.95, and 2.00) (yano, t., sled', v.d., ohnishi, t., and yagi, t. (1994) biochemistry 33, 494-499). in the present study, the nqo3 (66 kda) subunit, which is equivalent to the 75-kda subunit of bovine heart complex i, was overexpressed in e. coli. the expressed nqo3 subunit was found predominantly in the cytoplasmic phase and was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. the chemical analyses and uv-visible and epr spectroscopic studies showed that the expressed nqo3 subunit contains at least two distinct iron-sulfur clusters: a [2fe-2s] cluster with axial epr signals (g perpendicular, parallel = 1.934 and 2.026, and l perpendicular parallel = 1.8 and 3.0 millitesla) and a [4fe-4s] cluster with rhombic symmetry (gx,y,z = 1.892, 1.928, and 2.063, and lx,y,z = 2.40, 1.55, and  1.75 millitesla). the midpoint redox potentials of [2fe-2s] and [4fe-4s] clusters at ph 8.6 are -472 and -391 mv, respectively. the tetranuclear cluster in the isolated nqo3 subunit is sensitive toward oxidants and converts into [3fe-4s] form. the assignment of these iron-sulfur clusters to those identified in the p.  denitrificans ndh-1 enzyme complex and the possible functional role of the nqo3 subunit is discussed.

AB  == the napedabc locus coding for the periplasmic nitrate reductase of thiosphaera pantotropha has been cloned and sequenced. the large and small subunits of the enzyme are coded by napa and napb. the sequence of napa indicates that this protein binds the gmp-conjugated form of the molybdopterin cofactor. cysteine-181 is proposed to ligate the molybdenum atom. it is inferred that the active site of the periplasmic nitrate reductase is structurally related to those of the molybdenum-dependent formate dehydrogenases and bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductases, but is distinct from that of the membrane-bound respiratory nitrate reductases. a four-cysteine motif at the n-terminus of napa binds a [4fe-4s] cluster. the dna- and protein-derived primary sequence of napb confirm that this  protein is a dihaem c-type cytochrome and, together with spectroscopic data, indicate that both napb haems have bis-histidine ligation. napc is predicted to code for a membrane-anchored tetrahaem c-type cytochrome that shows sequence similarity to the nirt cytochrome c family. napc may be the direct electron donor to the napab complex. napd is predicted to encode a soluble cytoplasmic protein and nape a monotopic integral membrane protein, napdabc genes can be discerned at the aeg-46.5 locus of escherichia coli k-12, suggesting that this operon encodes  a periplasmic nitrate reductase system, while napd and napc are identified adjacent to the napab genes of alcaligenes eutrophus h16.

TI  == mutational analysis of mau genes involved in methylamine metabolism in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == a chromosomal fragment containing dna downstream from mauc was isolated from paracoccus denitrificans. sequence analysis of this fragment revealed the presence of four open reading frames, all transcribed in the same direction. the  products of the putative genes were found to be highly similar to mauj, maug, maum and maun of methylobacterium extorquens am1. using these four mau genes, 11  mau genes have been cloned from p. denitrificans to date. the gene order is maurfbedacjgmn, which is similar to that in m. extorquens am1. maul, present in m. extorquens am1, seems to be absent in p. denitrificans. mauj is predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein, and maug a periplasmic protein. the latter protein contains two putative heme-binding sites, and has some sequence resemblance to the cytochrome c peroxidase from pseudomonas aeruginosa. maum is also predicted to be located in the periplasm, but maun appears to be membrane associated. both  resemble ferredoxin-like proteins and contain four and two motifs, respectively,  characteristic for [4fe-4s] clusters. inactivation of maua, mauj, maug, maum and  maun was carried out by introduction of unmarked mutations in the chromosomal copies of these genes. maua and maug mutant strains were unable to grow on methylamine. the mauj mutant strain had an impaired growth rate and showed a lower dye-linked methylamine dehydrogenase (madh) activity than the parent strain. mutations in maum and maun had no effect on methylamine metabolism. the maua mutant strain specifically lacked the beta subunit of madh, but the alpha subunit and amicyanin, the natural electron acceptors of madh, were still produced. the maug mutant strain synthesized the alpha and beta subunits of madh  as well as amicyanin. however, no dye-linked madh activity was found in this mutant strain. in addition, as the wild-type enzyme displays a characteristic fluorescence emission spectrum upon addition of methylamine, this property was lost in the maug mutant strain. these results clearly show that maug is essential for the maturation of the beta subunit of madh, presumably via a step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan tryptophylquinone, the cofactor of madh. the mau gene  cluster maurfbedacjgmn was cloned on the broad-host vector peg400. transfer of this construct to mutant strains which were unable to grow on methylamine fully restored their ability to grow on this compound. a similar result was achieved for the closely related bacterium thiosphaera pantotropha, which is unable to utilize methylamine as the sole sources of carbon and energy.

AB  == holocarboxylase synthetase (hcs) catalyzes the biotinylation of the four biotin-dependent carboxylases in human cells. patients with hcs deficiency lack activity of all four carboxylases, indicating that a single hcs is targeted to the mitochondria and cytoplasm. we isolated 21 human hcs cdna clones, in four size classes of 2.0-4.0 kb, by complementation of an escherichia coli bira mutant defective in biotin ligase. expression of the cdna clones promoted biotinylation  of the bacterial biotinyl carboxyl carrier protein as well as a carboxyl-terminal fragment of the alpha subunit of human propionyl-coa carboxylase expressed from a plasmid. the open reading frame encodes a predicted protein of 726 aa and m(r) 80,759. northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a 5.8-kb major species and 4.0-, 4.5-, and 8.5-kb minor species of poly(a)+ rna in human tissues. human  hcs shows specific regions of homology with the bira protein of e. coli and the presumptive biotin ligase of paracoccus denitrificans. several forms of hcs mrna  are generated by alternative splicing, and as a result, two mrna molecules bear different putative translation initiation sites. a sequence upstream of the first translation initiation site encodes a peptide structurally similar to mitochondrial presequences, but it lacks an in-frame atg codon to direct its translation. we anticipate that alternative splicing most likely mediates the mitochondrial versus cytoplasmic expression, although the elements required for directing the enzyme to the mitochondria remain to be confirmed.

TI  == electron transfer between cytochrome c and the isolated cua domain: identification of substrate-binding residues in cytochrome c oxidase.
AB  == subunit ii of cytochrome c oxidase has a c-terminal domain that is exposed to aqueous solution on membrane surface and contains a copper center called cua. the central part of the cytochrome c binding site is thought to reside in this domain. we have expressed the subunit ii fragment of the paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase in a soluble form and studied its interaction with cytochrome c by stopped-flow spectroscopy. the oxidation of cytochrome c by the cua domain follows monophasic kinetics, indicating the presence of a single kinetically competent binding site. in low ionic strength medium, the domain oxidizes paracoccus cytochrome c-550 and horse mitochondrial cytochrome c at the  rates of 1.5 x 10(6) and 3 x 10(5) m-1 s-1, respectively. the reaction rates are  strongly dependent on ionic strength, which must reflect electrostatic interactions within the complex. the kd for the complex between the bacterial cytochrome c and the domain is 1.6 microm; i.e., it is similar to that between the mitochondrial cytochrome c and the intact oxidase, suggesting that both contain the same catalytically competent binding site. using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified five conserved residues of the cua domain that are involved in the cytochrome c binding. mutations of glutamine 148, glutamate 154, aspartate 206, aspartate 221, or glutamate 246 lead to a 35-85% decrease in  the rate of cytochrome c oxidation. the simultaneous substitution of three invariant carboxylic acids (aspartate 206, aspartate 221, and glutamate 246) leads to a 95% decrease in the reaction rate. conversely, the reaction can be enhanced by removing a positive charge (lysine 219) from the cua domain.

AB  == a genomic dna fragment from desulfovibrio fructosovorans, which strongly hybridized with the hydab genes from desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, was cloned and sequenced. this fragment was found to contain four genes, named hnda,  hndb, hndc, and hndd. analysis of the sequence homologies indicated that hnda shows 29, 21, and 26% identity with the 24-kda subunit from bos taurus complex i, the 25-kda subunit from paracoccus denitrificans nadh dehydrogenase type i, and the n-terminal domain of hoxf subunit of the nad-reducing hydrogenase from alcaligenes eutrophus, respectively. hndb does not show any significant homology  with any known protein. hndc shows 37 and 33% identity with the c-terminal domain of hoxf and the 51-kda subunit from b. taurus complex i, respectively, and has the requisite structural features to be able to bind one flavin mononucleotide, one nad, and three [4fe-4s] clusters. hndd has 40, 42, and 48% identity with hydrogenase i from clostridium pasteurianum and hydc and hyda from d. vulgaris hildenborough, respectively. the 4.5-kb length of the transcripts expressed in d. fructosovorans and in escherichia coli (pss13) indicated that all four genes were present on the same transcription unit. the sizes of the four polypeptides were measured by performing heterologous expression of hndabcd in e. coli, using the t7 promoter/polymerase system. the products of hnda, hndb, hndc, and hndd were 18.8, 13.8, 52, and 63.4 kda, respectively. one hndc deletion mutant, called sm3, was constructed by performing marker exchange mutagenesis. immunoblotting studies carried out on cell extracts from d. fructosovorans wild-type and sm3 strains, using antibodies directed against hndc, indicated that the 52-kda protein was recognized in extracts from the wild-type strain only. in soluble extracts from d. fructosovorans wild type, a 10-fold induction of nadp reduction was observed when h(2) was present, but no h(2)-dependent nad reduction ever occurred. this h(2)-dependent nadp reductase activity disappeared completely in extracts from sm3. these results indicate that the hnd operon actually encodes an nadp-reducing hydrogenase in d. fructosovorans.

TI  == engineered fv fragments as a tool for the one-step purification of integral multisubunit membrane protein complexes.
AB  == the preparation of pure and homogeneous membrane proteins or membrane protein complexes is time consuming, and the yields are frequently insufficient for structural studies. to circumvent these problems we established an indirect immunoaffinity chromatography method based on engineered fv fragments. cdnas encoding the variable domains of hybridoma-derived antibodies raised against various membrane proteins were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the fv fragments were engineered to serve as bifunctional adaptor molecules. the fv fragment binds to the epitope of the membrane protein, while the strep tag affinity peptide, which was fused to the carboxy-terminus of the vh chain, immobilizes the antigen-fv complex on a streptavidin sepharose column. the usefulness of this technique is illustrated with membrane protein complexes from  paracoccus denitrificans, namely, the cytochrome c oxidase (ec 1.9.3.1), the ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (ec 1.10.2.2), and subcomplexes or individual subunits thereof. these membrane proteins were purified simply by combining the crude p. denitrificans membrane preparation with the e. coli periplasmic cell fraction containing the corresponding fv fragment, followed by solubilization and streptavidin affinity chromatography. pure and highly active membrane protein complexes were eluted in the fv-bound form using diaminobiotin for mild competitive displacement of the strep tag. the affinity column could thus be reused under continuous operation for several months. five to 10 mg of membrane protein complexes could be obtained without any detectable impurities within five hours.

AB  == a transposon tn5 mutant of paracoccus denitrificans, dp108, was incapable of anaerobic or methylotrophic growth and scored negative in the nadi cytochrome c oxidase test. p. denitrificans dp108 grown aerobically on succinate or choline was devoid of soluble c-type cytochromes and accumulated periplasmic apocytochrome c550, but the membrane-bound holocytochromes c1 and c552 were present at 5-10% of the levels observed in wild-type cells. dp108 genomic dna flanking the site of tn5 insertion was cloned by marker rescue and used to probe  a p. denitrificans wild-type dna library. a hybridizing 3.05 kb bamhi fragment capable of complementing the dp108 mutation was isolated and a 2.05 kb region of  this was sequenced. one major open reading frame equivalent to 413 amino acids was identified, the predicted product of which was similar (33% identity, 55% similarity) to the predicted product of the cych gene previously identified in bradyrhizobium japonicum. similarity of the two cych gene products to the predicted products of two escherichia coli genes, nrfg and yejp, was also detected. significant differences between the phenotypes of p. denitrificans dp108 and the b. japonicum cych mutant cox3, especially with respect to cytochrome c1 synthesis, suggest that the cych gene product may be an assembly factor.

AB  == the fv fragment of a monoclonal antibody, 7e2 (igg1, kappa, murine), which is directed against the integral membrane protein cytochrome c oxidase (ec 1.9.3.1)  from paracoccus denitrificans, was cloned and produced in escherichia coli. crystals suitable for high-resolution x-ray analysis were obtained by microdialysis under low salt conditions. the crystals belong to the orthorhombic  space group p2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 51.51 a, b = 56.15 a,  c = 99.86 a (1 a = 0.1 nm) and contain one fv fragment per asymmetric unit. using synchrotron radiation diffraction data were collected up to 1.28 a resolution. this high resolution is very unusual for a heterodimeric protein. the crystals should open the way for refining not only the atomic positions, but also for obtaining information about internal dynamics.

TI  == expression and characterization of human and chimeric human-paracoccus denitrificans electron transfer flavoproteins.
AB  == electron transfer flavoprotein (etf) is a heterodimer that contains a single equivalent of fad and accepts electrons from nine flavoprotein dehydrogenases in  the mitochondrial matrix. human etf was expressed in escherichia coli using the expression vector previously employed to express paracoccus denitrificans etf (bedzyk, l. a., escudero, k. w., gill, r. e., griffin, k. j., and frerman, f. e.  (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 20211-20217). cdnas encoding the beta and alpha subunits of the human protein were inserted into the vector, mimicking the arrangement of the p. denitrificans genes in which coding sequences are joined by overlapping termination and initiation codons. a human etf containing 30% p. denitrificans sequence at the amino terminus of the beta subunit was also expressed and purified. this chimeric etf has 64% sequence identity with the human sequence in the substituted region. kinetic constants of medium chain and short chain acyl-coa dehydrogenases for the chimeric etfs were slightly changed from those of human etf; but, there are marked differences in the kinetic constants of sarcosine dehydrogenase and electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase with the two etfs. absorption spectra of the three redox states of human, chimeric, and p. denitrificans etf flavins are identical. however, the flavin circular dichroism spectra of the three etfs are characteristic for each species. the spectrum of the chimeric etf has both human  and p. denitrificans etf features. the amplitude of the 436 nm band is identical  to that of the of the human etf flavin, but the amplitude of the 375 nm band is identical to that of the p. denitrificans etf flavin. thus, flavin in the chimeric etf appears to be exposed to dipoles in the protein framework provided by human and bacterial sequences. these spectral data indicate that the flavin is located in the vicinity of the amino-terminal region of the beta subunit. the kinetic data suggest that the amino-terminal region of the beta subunit comprises part of the docking site for some primary dehydrogenases and electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the genes encoding the two subunits of the methylotrophic bacterium w3a1 electron transfer flavoprotein.
AB  == the genes encoding the two different subunits of the electron transfer flavoprotein (etf) from the methylotrophic bacterium w3a1 have been identified, cloned, and sequenced. a 0.8-kilobase pair dna fragment was generated for use as  a molecular probe by the amplification of genomic sequences using the polymerase  chain reaction and a primer pair with degenerate sequences derived from the nh2-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the etf subunits purified from w3a1. the screening of a partial genomic minilibrary containing size-selected bamhi-sali fragments using this probe identified a 2.2-kilobase pair insert containing the complete coding sequences for both w3a1 etf subunits. the genes are arranged in tandem in the genomic dna with only 2 bases between the tag translation termination codon of the small subunit and the atg translation initiation codon of the large subunit. the deduced amino acid sequences of each of the w3a1 etf subunits exhibit only approximately 30% identity with the corresponding subunits of the etf from human, rat, and paracoccus denitrificans,  which as a group are greater than 50% identical. thus, the etf from w3a1 may exhibit some unique structural features that, like other differences in some of its physical and functional properties, may distinguish this etf from others in this family. a highly homologous region near the cooh terminus of the large subunit in all the etf proteins was found to contain a sequence that matches in several ways the adp-binding motif of flavoproteins and other dinucleotide-binding proteins, suggesting that the large subunit forms a portion  of the fad (or amp) binding site in these proteins. under control of the tac promoter, the cloned etf subunit genes were co-expressed in escherichia coli producing the heterodimeric holoprotein with physical, spectral, and electron-accepting properties essentially identical to the etf isolated from w3a1. the recombinant etf serves as the electron acceptor for w3a1 trimethylamine dehydrogenase in vitro, accumulating as the air-stable anionic semiquinone in the presence of excess trimethylamine. fully reduced etf could not be obtained even after prolonged enzymatic reduction.

TI  == mo(v) electron paramagnetic resonance signals from the periplasmic nitrate reductase of thiosphaera pantotropha.
AB  == a mo(v) electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) study of the periplasmic respiratory nitrate reductase of the denitrifying bacterium thiosphaera pantotropha has revealed that the molybdenum centre of this enzyme is very similar to that in the assimilatory nitrate reductase of azotobacter vinelandii but is somewhat different from that of the membrane-bound bacterial respiratory nitrate reductases such as those of escherichia coli and paracoccus denitrificans. we have identified the mo(v) species most likely to be the catalytically relevant one and characterised two other sets of mo(v) epr signals. as well as exhibiting epr signals with g values typical of bacterial molybdenum-containing reductases, molybdenum-hydroxylase-like epr signals can be  elicited in the nitrate reductase of t. pantotropha upon treatment with excess dithionite. the only other enzyme known to display this phenomenon is the periplasmic dimethylsulphoxide reductase of rhodobacter capsulatus. a mechanism for the generation of these signals is proposed which invokes reduction of the pterin ring of the molybdenum cofactor linked to gmp from the dihydro to the tetrahydro state. the possibilities and implications of there being cysteine ligands to the molybdenum centres of these two enzymes are discussed.

AB  == active sludge systems containing benzothiazoles may be intoxicated by 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (mbt). this toxicity towards several bacteria is now confirmed and is situated at around 100 mg mbt l-1. octanol-water partition coefficients indicated that mbt might interact with membrane-bound systems. this  was confirmed through experiments showing that bacterial cell respiration was inhibited using lactate or succinate as substrates. using these substrates and also nadh, it was found that their oxidation was also inhibited using isolated membrane fragments of escherichia coli and paracoccus denitrificans. methylene blue reduction was also found to be inhibited. the oxidation of ascorbate was not inhibited in p. denitrificans. from these results it is suggested that mbt might  interact with the respiratory chain at the level of flavoproteins or quinones and fe-s clusters.

AB  == in order to identify the ligand residues of the [2fe-2s] cluster of the 25 kda (nqo2) subunit of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase of paracoccus denitrificans, we mutated individually all seven cysteine residues (c61, c96, c101, c104, c113, c137, and c141) and one conserved histidine residue  (h92) to ser or ala and expressed them in e. coli. after purification of the mutated 25 kda subunits, the effect of mutations on the iron-sulfur cluster were  characterized by chemical analyses and uv-visible and epr spectroscopy. all mutated subunits, especially mutants of conserved cysteines, contained lower amounts of non-heme iron than wild-type. the subunits of three non-conserved cysteine residues (c61, c104, and c113) mutated to ser and a histidine residue (h92) mutated to ala exhibited essentially the same spectroscopic properties as those of the wild-type subunit. in contrast, mutation of the four conserved cysteine residues (c96, c101, c137, and c141) to ser or ala considerably altered  the uv-visible and epr spectra from the wild-type subunit. these results indicate that the four conserved cysteine residues coordinate the [2fe-2s] cluster in the  p. denitrificans 25 kda subunit.

TI  == bacterial genes and proteins involved in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes and terminal oxidases.
AB  == a total of nine genes potentially concerned with the biosynthesis of c-type cytochromes have been identified recently in the bacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhodobacter capsulatus, and homologous counterparts appear to be present also in escherichia coli. most of the respective gene products are membrane-bound, while others are located in the periplasmic space. as inferred from sequence analyses, several of these proteins may play roles in membrane transport or redox processes, both functions being consistent with the required steps in cytochrome c formation (membrane translocation of heme; covalent linkage of protoheme ix to cysteine thiols). further genes of b. japonicum, e. coli, bacillus subtilis and paracoccus denitrificans have been studied whose products are necessary for the formation of intact heme/copper oxidases. some of them are  probably required in protein folding and assembly whereas others appear to be enzymes catalyzing steps in the biosynthesis of the heme cofactors.

AB  == diphenyleneiodonium (dpi) inhibits the mitochondrial nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i) on the substrate side of the fe-s clusters. in the inhibited nadh-supplemented state all of the fe-s clusters are oxidized, whereas  the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the protein-bound fmn can be visualized. it is characterized by troughs at 370 and 450 nm and a small increase of absorbance in the 500-700-nm region. dpi probably reacts irreversibly with fmn, because oxidation of fmn is blocked even after its extraction from the enzyme. inhibition requires preincubation of enzyme in the presence of nadh and dpi. the lower the nadh/nad+ ratio or the ph, or the higher the nad+/dpi ratio, the more dpi is required for inhibition. nad+ and dpi apparently compete for a common site. both ubiquinone and dichlorophenolindophenol reductase activities are fully blocked by dpi, whereas the ferricyanide reductase activity is inhibited by 75%. similar results were found with complex i and two rotenone-insensitive preparations, subcomplex i lambda and the flavoprotein fraction. dpi also inhibits nadh oxidation by bacterial nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase-1 (ndh-1) in membranes of paracoccus denitrificans and escherichia coli.

AB  == the 25-kda subunit of the proton-translocating nadh-quinone oxidoreductase (ndh-1) of paracoccus denitrificans has been expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. epr studies of the reduced recombinant protein indicated that the expressed subunit contains a single [2fe-2s] cluster (yano, t., sled', v. d., ohnishi, t., and yagi, t. (1994) biochemistry 33, 494-499). in this report, the electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of the [2fe-2s]2+,+  center have been investigated by the combination of absorption, circular dichroism, variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance raman spectroscopies and compared with a range of simple [2fe-2s]-containing proteins. the results are consistent with coordination by two cysteinyl residues at both the reducible and nonreducible iron sites and reveal a striking similarity between the properties of the [2fe-2s] cluster in the p. denitrificans ndh-1 25-kda subunit and those of the subclass of ferredoxin-type [2fe-2s] centers typified by clostridium pasteurianum 2fe ferredoxin. the four cyteines residues involved in cluster ligation in these  proteins have been tentatively identified based on sequence homology considerations.

(1993) biochim. biophys. acta 1141, 1-17]. the complete dna sequence of the gene cluster encoding the energy-transducing nadh-q  oxidoreductase of p. denitrificans has been determined. this paper reports the expression of the 25-kilodalton (kda) (nqo2) subunit of the p. denitrificans enzyme complex in escherichia coli and the characterization of the iron-sulfur cluster bound to the expressed subunit. the 25-kda subunit was expressed in the cytoplasmic phase but not in the membrane fraction of e. coli cells and then purified using an affinity nickel chelation column. the purified subunit contains 1.44 mol of non-heme iron and 1.33 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of subunit. epr analysis of the reduced form of this subunit indicates that the expressed subunit contains a single binuclear [2fe-2s] cluster. this cluster exhibits a spectrum of rhombic symmetry with g values of gx,y,z = 1.913, 1.942, and 1.996, which is very similar to the spectrum of the [2fe-2s] cluster in the resolved flavoprotein ii subfraction (subunit 24 + 9 kda) of bovine heart complex i [ragan, c. i., galante, y. m., hatefi, y., & ohnishi, t.

TI  == molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  == there is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. they display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. they can be divided into three  major categories. (1) the nad- or nadp-dependent dehydrogenases. these can in turn be divided into the group i long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases i, ii, and iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of pseudomonas putida; the group ii short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of klebsiella aerogenes; the group iii "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase ii of zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase iv of saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900  residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of escherichia coli and clostridium acetobutylicum. the aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of a. methanolica and mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-n,n-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) nad(p)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor f420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of acetobacter and gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) oxidases that catalyze  an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi  involved in lignin degradation. this review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. the discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. the physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.

TI  == the fnr family of transcriptional regulators.
AB  == homologues of the transcriptional regulator fnr from escherichia coli have been identified in a variety of taxonomically diverse bacterial species. despite being structurally very similar, members of the fnr family have disparate regulatory roles. those from shewanella putrefaciens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas stutzeri and rhodopseudomonas palustris are functionally similar to fnr in that they regulate anaerobic respiration or carbon metabolism. four rhizobial proteins (from rhizobium meliloti, r. leguminosarum, b. japonicum and azorhizobium caulinodans) are involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation; a fifth (from rhizobium strain ic3342) has unknown function. two proteins from mammalian pathogens (actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and bordetella pertussis) may be involved in the regulation of toxin expression. the fnr protein of vibrio fischeri regulates bioluminescence, and the function of the one known fnr homologue from a gram-positive organism (lactobacillus casei) remains to be elucidated. some members of this family, like fnr itself, appear to function as sensors of oxygen availability, whereas others do not. the ability to sense and respond to oxygen limitation may be correlated with the presence of cysteine residues which, in the case of fnr, are thought to be involved in oxygen or redox sensing. the mechanism of dna sequence recognition is probably conserved, or very similar, throughout this family. in a number of other gram-negative species, there is good indirect evidence for the existence of fnr analogues; these include alcaligenes eutrophus, a. denitrificans, a. faecalis, paracoccus denitrificans and a number of pseudomonas species.

AB  == the structural gene for the respiratory nitrous-oxide reductase from paracoccus denitrificans has been cloned using a probe derived from the structural gene, nosz, for this enzyme from pseudomonas stutzeri. the cloned gene could be expressed surprisingly well (presumably yielding an apo-protein) using an expression vector in escherichia coli. sequencing the nosz gene from p. denitrificans has shown that the periplasmic nitrous-oxide reductase of this organism is highly similar in sequence to previously derived primary sequences for the enzyme from three other organisms. as with the other reductases, an unusually long signal sequence is deduced and a common motif of gxxrrxxlg near the beginning of this sequence is present. the results of n-terminal sequencing of the mature nitrous-oxide reductase from the closely related organism thiosphaera pantotropha indicate that processing of the p. denitrificans precursor occurs between amino acids at positions 57 and 58. the predicted signal peptide is therefore of the same length and of similar overall structure to that  previously described for the p. denitrificans methylamine dehydrogenase small subunit (maua). the p. denitrificans sequence for the mature nitrous-oxide reductase reduces from 14 to 11 and 6 to 4, respectively, the number of conserved histidine and methionine residues compared to previous sequences. three cysteine  and four tryptophan residues, previously identified as conserved amongst nitrous-oxide reductases, are found in the paracoccus enzyme. a comparison of the sequence of the c-terminal region of the nitrous-oxide-reductase sequence with that for the cua region of subunit ii of the cytochrome aa3 from p. denitrificans reveals considerable sequence similarities. upstream of the structural gene for nosz are sequences ttgaagcttaaccag (centred at position -21 with respect to the start codon) and cccggtggtcatcaag (centred at position -126). although both could be fnr (anr) boxes, the latter is far more probable to have this role because only it is likely to be upstream of a promoter site. this is the first indication at the dna sequence level for the existence of this regulatory system in p. denitrificans. analysis of the flanking dna sequences revealed reading frames upstream and downstream of the nosz gene showing similarity to the nosr and nosd  genes, respectively, of pseudomonas species. an s30 in vitro transcription/translation system was developed for p. denitrificans which permitted the expression of the cloned gene for nitrous-oxide reductase and which will be of general value in other studies of this organism.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of the genes encoding subunits of paracoccus  denitrificans electron transfer flavoprotein.
AB  == the genes encoding the two subunits of paracoccus denitrificans electron transfer flavoprotein (etf) were identified by screening a genomic library constructed in  pbluescript ii sk+ with probes generated by amplification of genomic sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. primers for the polymerase chain reaction were designed based on peptide sequences from purified paracoccus etf subunits. the genes are arranged in tandem in the genomic dna with the deoxyadenylic acid residue in the tga termination codon of the small subunit providing the deoxyadenylic acid residue for the atg initiating codon of the large subunit. the deduced amino acid sequences of the etf subunits exhibits extensive sequence identity with the human etf subunits. the paracoccus etf is expressed from the pbluescript vector in escherichia coli, yielding 30 mg of purified, catalytically active protein per liter of culture.

AB  == many bacteria contain proton-translocating membrane-bound nadh-quinone oxidoreductases (ndh-1), which demonstrate significant genetic, spectral, and kinetic similarity with their mitochondrial counterparts. this review is devoted  to the comparative aspects of the iron-sulfur cluster composition of ndh-1 from the most well-studied bacterial systems to date.: paracoccus denitrificans, rhodobacter sphaeroides, escherichia coli, and thermus thermophilus. these bacterial systems provide useful models for the study of coupling site i and contain all the essential parts of the electron-transfer and proton-translocating machinery of their eukaryotic counterparts.

TI  == attempts to define distinct parts of nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i).
AB  == the nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex i) is made up of a peripheral part and a membrane part. the two parts are arranged perpendicular to each other and give the complex an unusual l-shaped structure. the peripheral part protrudes into the matrix space and constitutes the proximal segment of the electron pathway with the nadh-binding site, the fmn and at least three iron-sulfur clusters. the membrane part constitutes the distal segment of the electron pathway with at least one iron-sulfur cluster and the ubiquinone-binding site. both parts are assembled separately and relationships of the major structural modules of the two parts with different bacterial enzymes suggest, that both parts also emerged independently in evolution. this assumption is further supported by the conserved order of bacterial complex i genes, which correlates with the topological arrangement of the corresponding subunits in the two parts of complex i.

TI  == identification of a two-component regulatory system controlling methanol dehydrogenase synthesis in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == upstream of the moxfjgir genes of paracoccus denitrificans a regulatory region involved in methanol oxidation was identified. the nucleotide sequence of this region was determined and revealed three genes, moxz, moxy and moxx, which are transcribed opposite to moxf and which encode proteins of 16.4, 48.2 and 24.5 kda, respectively. computer alignment analysis revealed that the gene products of moxy and moxx have homology with the protein histidine kinases and the response regulators, respectively, forming the two-component regulatory systems. no significant homology of the moxz gene product with any known protein, sequenced thus far, was found. the moxz, moxy and moxx proteins were identified in escherichia coli in a heterologous expression system. mutants with an insertion of a kanamycin-resistance marker in moxz, moxy and moxx were isolated. these mutant strains were unable to grow on methanol while growth on methylamine was not affected. in the moxz mutant both subunits of methanol dehydrogenase and cytochrome c551i were not synthesized, methanol dehydrogenase activity was absent, and hardly any expression of a moxz-lacz transcriptional fusion was found. complementation of the mutation was observed after addition of the three genes moxz, y and x, in trans. this indicates that the two-component regulatory system is involved in activation of the moxf promoter. a mutant with an unmarked  deletion in moxz was isolated. this mutant showed reduced growth on methanol relative to the wild type. expression of the moxf-lacz transcriptional fusion gene and methanol dehydrogenase activity in this strain were also lower than those found in the wild type. therefore, besides the two proteins of the two-component regulatory pair, a third protein, moxz, appears to be involved in regulation of methanol dehydrogenase synthesis.

(1991a) biochemistry 30, 8678-8684; (1991b) biochemistry 30, 6422-6428; (1992a) biochemistry 31, 6925-6932; (1992b) arch. biochem. biophys. 296, 40-48]. this paper reports the identification, cloning, and sequencing of seven additional structural genes in the same gene cluster (p.  denitrificans enzyme complex). these seven genes, designated nqo8-14, are composed of 1038, 492, 603, 306, 2112, 1542, and 1500 base pairs, respectively. the polypeptides encoded by the nqo8-14 genes are homologous, respectively, to the nd1 product, the 23-kda polypeptide, and the nd6, nd4l, nd5, nd4, and nd2 products of the bovine nadh-q oxidoreductase. the order of the 14 structural genes of the paracoccus energy-transducing nadh-q oxidoreductase in the gene cluster is nq07, nqo6, nqo5, nqo2, nqo1, nqo3, nqo8, nqo9, nqo10, nqo11, nqo12, nqo13, and nqo14. downstream from the nqo14 gene an open reading frame (designated urf240) was detected which encodes a predicted polypeptide homologous to the biotin [acetyl-coa-carboxylase] ligase of escherichia coli. in addition, a putative terminal sequence motif was observed downstream of the nqo14 gene, suggesting that the structural gene nqo14 is the 3'-terminal gene of the paracoccus nadh-q oxidoreductase gene cluster. nucleotide sequencing of the entire gene cluster revealed the presence of three unidentified reading frames: one between the nqo3 and nqo8 genes and other two between the nqo9 and nqo10 genes. these are designated urf4, urf5, and urf6 and are composed of 768, 393, and 405 base pairs, respectively. the possible functions of the putative proteins encoded by urf5 and urf6 are discussed.

TI  == is intracytoplasmic membrane structure a generic criterion? it does not coincide  with phylogenetic interrelationships among phototrophic purple nonsulfur bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna or rrna gene sequences of the type strains of 5 species of rhodobacter, rhodopseudomonas blastica and paracoccus denitrificans were determined. the sequence analysis revealed that rhodobacter species, whose intracytoplasmic membrane systems were characteristically vesicular, composed a sole cluster. rhodopseudomonas blastica, whose intracytoplasmic membrane system was lamellar, was included in the cluster of rhodobacter. the phylogenetic co-clustering of these bacteria conformed to their possessing of the identical types of carotenoids. paracoccus denitrificans, which is nonphototrophic, is a right member of the rhodobacter cluster. rhodobacter species, rhodopseudomonas blastica and paracoccus denitrificans are apart from the other phototrophic bacteria and have the common deletions of 21 bases at the positions 1258 to 1278  (escherichia coli numbering system). it was demonstrated that the morphological character "intracytoplasmic membrane structure", that has been regarded as a generic criterion does not reflect the phylogeny in the phototrophic bacteria. the transfer of rhodopseudomonas blastica to the genus rhodobacter is proposed.

(1991) biochemistry 30, 6422-6428; (1991) biochemistry 30, 8678-8684; (1992) arch. biochem. biophys. 296, 40-48]. in this report, the four structural genes nqo4, nqo5, nqo6, and nqo7 of the same paracoccus denitrificans oxidoreductase were cloned and sequenced. on the basis of sequence homology and immunological cross-reactivity, these genes encode counterparts of the 49-, 30-, and 20-kda polypeptides and the mitochondrial dna nd3 polypeptides of bovine mitochondrial complex i. these seven structural genes were found to be located in the same gene cluster. the order of the seven structural genes of the paracoccus nadh-quinone oxidoreductase in the gene cluster is nqo7, nqo6, nqo5, nqo4, nqo2, nqo1, and nqo3. upstream of the nqo7 gene, an open reading frame encoding a predicted polypeptide homologous to the uv repair enzyme a of escherichia coli and micrococcus lysodeikticus was detected. the 5'-terminus of the gene cluster carrying the paracoccus nadh-quinone oxidoreductase was studied, and the possible promoter region is discussed. the nqo4 and nqo5 genes appear to code for the m(r) 48,000 and 21,000 polypeptides of the isolated paracoccus nadh dehydrogenase complex [yagi, t. (1986) arch. biochem. biophys. 250, 302-311] on the basis of amino acid analyses and n-terminal protein sequence analyses. the antisera to the bovine complex i 49- and 30-kda polypeptides cross-reacted with the paracoccus 48- and 21-kda subunits, respectively.

TI  == structure of holo-chaperonin studied with electron microscopy. oligomeric cpn10 on top of two layers of cpn60 rings with two stripes each.
AB  == a structural model of holo-chaperonin, known as a protein-folding control protein comprising 60 kda (cpn60) and 10 kda polypeptides (cpn10), is proposed based on the electron microscopic images of holo-chaperonin from thermus thermophilus and  cpn60 from paracoccus denitrificans. isolated paracoccus cpn60 shows very similar images to those of escherichia coli tetradecameric cpn60, a seven-membered ring in the top view and a rectangular shape with four stripes in the side view. however, a small number of half-thick rectangles with two stripes are also seen which indicates that a single cpn60-heptamer ring has two stripes parallel to the plane of the ring. thermus holo-chaperonin shows a bullet-like shape in the side  view, and antibody against cpn10 binds only to the round side of the bullet. we conclude that a single cpn60-heptamer ring with two stripes stacks into two layers, and a cpn10 oligomer binds to one side of the layers.

TI  == metabolic pathways in paracoccus denitrificans and closely related bacteria in relation to the phylogeny of prokaryotes.
AB  == denitrification and methylotrophy in paracoccus denitrificans are discussed. the  properties of the enzymes of denitrification: the nitrate-nitrite antiporter, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase are described. the genes for none of these proteins have yet been cloned and sequenced from p. denitrificans. a number of sequences are available for enzymes from escherichia coli, pseudomonas stutzeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa. it is concluded that pathway specific c-type cytochromes are involved in denitrification. at least 40 genes are involved in denitrification. in methanol oxidation at least 20 genes are involved. in this case too pathway specific c-type cytochromes are involved. the sequence homology between the quinoproteins methanol dehydrogenase, alcoholde-hydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase is discussed. this superfamily of proteins is believed to be derived from a common ancestor. the moxfjgi operon determines the structural components of methanol dehydrogenase and the associated c-type cytochrome. upstream of this operon 3 regulatory proteins were found. the moxy protein shows  the general features of a sensor protein and the moxx protein those of a regulatory protein. thus a two component regulatory system is involved in both denitrification and methylotrophy. the phylogeny of prokaryotes based on 16s rrna sequence is discussed. it is remarkable that the 16s rrna of thiosphaera pantotropha is identical to that of p. denitrificans. still these bacteria show a number of differences. t. pantotropha is able to denitrify under aerobic circumstances and it shows heterotrophic nitrification. nitrification and heterotrophic nitrification are found in species belonging to the beta-and gamma-subdivisions of purple non-sulfur bacteria. thus the occurrence of heterotrophic nitrification in t. pantotropha, which belongs to the alpha-subdivision of purple non-sulfur bacteria is a remarkable property. furthermore t. pantotropha contains two nitrate reductases of which the periplasmic one is supposed to be involved in aerobic denitrification. the nitrite reductase is of the cu-type and not of the cytochrome cd1 type as in p. denitrificans. also the cytochrome b of the qbc complex of t. pantotropha is highly similar to its counterpart in p. denitrificans. it is hypothesized that the differences between these two organisms which both contain large megaplasmids is due to a combination of loss of genetic information and plasmid-coded properties. the distribution of a number of complex metabolic systems in eubacteria and in a number of species belonging to the alpha-group of purple non  sulphur bacteria is reviewed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == identification of the dna region responsible for sulfur-oxidizing ability of thiosphaera pantotropha.
AB  == for the identification of the dna region responsible for the sulfur-oxidizing ability (sox) of thiosphaera pantotropha, we used previously isolated tn5-mob insertional sox- mutants. for seven mutants, the tn5-mob insertion was localized  on the chromosome rather than on the megaplasmids phg41 or phg42 by using the tn5-mob-harboring vehicle psup5011 as probe. the specific insertion of tn5-mob into a sox gene was determined for one sox- mutant, strain tp19. an 18-kb ecori fragment was cloned in escherichia coli by using the mobilizable plasmid psup202  as vector and the kanamycin resistance gene of tn5 as marker. conjugal transfer of the resulting hybrid plasmid, pks3-13, to the wild type resulted in two phenotypically different groups of recombinants. ninety-five percent of the recombinants were sox+, kanamycin resistant, and tetracycline resistant; 5% were  homogenote recombinants exhibiting the sox-, kanamycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive phenotype, and these indicated the specific insertion. to  isolate the respective wild-type sox gene, total dna from a heterogenote recombinant was partially restricted with ecori, religated, and transformed in e. coli. transformants carrying a psup202-derived hybrid plasmid with the intact sox gene were identified by screening for a tetracycline-resistant, kanamycin-sensitive, and chloramphenicol-sensitive phenotype and by complementation of the sox- mutant tp19. a plasmid of this type, peg12, contained an insert of 13 kb which gave a positive signal in southern hybridization with the homologous probe of pks3-13. peg12 was used to determine the dna homology of  the sulfur-oxidizing enzyme systems of other thiobacteria. strong hybridization signals were obtained with total dna of the neutrophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria paracoccus denitrificans, thiobacillus versutus, and rhodobacter capsulatus. no hybridization signal was obtained with dna of other neutrophilic or acidophilic thiobacteria examined.

AB  == the periplasmically located cytochrome c553i of paracoccus denitrificans was purified from cells grown aerobically on choline as the carbon source. the purified protein was digested with trypsin to obtain several protein fragments. the n-terminal regions of these fragments were sequenced. on the basis of one of  these sequences, a mix of 17-mer oligonucleotides was synthesized. by using this  mix as a probe, the structural gene encoding cytochrome c553i (cycb) was isolated. the nucleotide sequence of this gene was determined from a genomic bank. the n-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence showed characteristics of a signal sequence. based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein, the calculated molecular weight is 22,427. the gene encoding  cytochrome c553i was mutated by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene. as a consequence of the mutation, cytochrome c553i was absent from the periplasmic protein fraction. the mutation in cycb resulted in a decreased maximum specific growth rate on methanol, while the molecular growth yield was not affected. growth on methylamine or succinate was not affected at all. upstream of cycb the  3' part of an open reading frame (orf1) was identified. the deduced amino acid sequence of this part of orf1 showed homology with methanol dehydrogenases from p. denitrificans and methylobacterium extorquens am1. in addition, it showed homology with other quinoproteins like alcohol dehydrogenase from acetobacter aceti and glucose dehydrogenase from both acinetobacter calcoaceticus and escherichia coli. immediately downstream from cycb, the 5' part of another open reading frame (orf2) was found. the deduced amino acid sequence of this part of orf2 showed homology with the moxj gene products from p. denitrificans and m. extorquens am1.

TI  == metabolic regulation including anaerobic metabolism in paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == under anaerobic circumstances in the presence of nitrate paracoccus denitrificans is able to denitrify. the properties of the reductases involved in nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase are described. for that purpose not only the properties of the enzymes of p. denitrificans are considered but also those from escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas stutzeri. nitrate reductase consists of three subunits: the alpha subunit contains the molybdenum cofactor, the beta subunit contains the iron sulfur clusters, and the gamma subunit is a special cytochrome  b. nitrate is reduced at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and evidence for the presence of a nitrate-nitrite antiporter is presented. electron flow is from  ubiquinol via the specific cytochrome b to the nitrate reductase. nitrite reductase (which is identical to cytochrome cd1) and nitrous oxide reductase are  periplasmic proteins. nitric oxide reductase is a membrane-bound enzyme. the bc1  complex is involved in electron flow to these reductases and the whole reaction takes place at the periplasmic side of the membrane. it is now firmly established that no is an obligatory intermediate between nitrite and nitrous oxide. nitrous  oxide reductase is a multi-copper protein. a large number of genes is involved in the acquisition of molybdenum and copper, the formation of the molybdenum cofactor, and the insertion of the metals. it is estimated that at least 40 genes are involved in the process of denitrification. the control of the expression of  these genes in p. denitrificans is totally unknown. as an example of such complex regulatory systems the function of the fnr, narx, and narl gene products in the expression of nitrate reductase in e. coli is described. the control of the effects of oxygen on the reduction of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide are discussed. oxygen inhibits reduction of nitrate by prevention of nitrate uptake in the cell. in the case of nitrite and nitrous oxide a competition between reductases and oxidases for a limited supply of electrons from primary dehydrogenases seems to play an important role. under some circumstances no formed from nitrite may inhibit oxidases, resulting in a redistribution of electron flow from oxygen to nitrite. p. denitrificans contains three main oxidases: cytochrome aa3, cytochrome o, and cytochrome co. cytochrome o is proton translocating and receives its electrons from ubiquinol. some properties of cytochrome co, which receives its electrons from cytochrome c, are reported.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the structural genes of cytochrome-c oxidase in bacillus subtilis have been isolated and sequenced. five genes, ctab-f, are closely spaced. ctac, ctad, ctae  and ctaf are the genes for subunits ii, i, iii and ivb, respectively, ctab, which may encode an assembly factor, is separated and upstream from the others. in comparison to its mitochondrial counterparts, subunit i has an extended c-terminus with two additional transmembrane segments, whereas subunit iii has lost two such segments from its n-terminus. the c-terminal extension in subunit ii is a covalent cytochrome-c domain, previously characterized only in the thermophilic oxidases. subunit ivb, a small hydrophobic protein, is a novel subunit. these predictions suggest that the b. subtilis cytochrome-c oxidase is structurally more related to the four-subunit escherichia coli cytochrome-bo complex than, for instance, to the paracoccus denitrificans enzyme. cytochrome aa3, which was previously isolated from b. subtilis [de vrij, w., azzi, a. & konings, w. n. (1983) eur. j. biochem. 131, 97-103] is not encoded by the ctac-f  genes; thus, there seems to be two different cytochrome-aa3-type oxidases in this gram-positive bacterium.

(1988) j. biochem. 103, 606-610], although the main portions of the sequences constituting cytochrome a (fea), cytochrome a3 (feb), and cub are correct. ps3 co2 has an additional sequence for cytochrome c after the cua binding protein portion with 2 transmembrane segments, which is homologous to the mitochondrial counterpart. ps3 co3 has dccd-binding glutamyl residues but contains only 5 transmembrane segments, unlike the mitochondrial counterpart, which has 7 segments. the subunits of ps3 cytochrome oxidase (aa3-type) show clear similarity in amino acid sequences with those of cytochrome bo-type oxidase from escherichia coli as well, in spite of the difference of hemes. ps3 co3 and co4 are much more similar to e.  coli co3 and co4 than to mitochondrial co3 and co4, respectively.

TI  == inhibition by capsaicin of nadh-quinone oxidoreductases is correlated with the presence of energy-coupling site 1 in various organisms.
AB  == the nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity of the respiratory chains of several organisms was inhibited by capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, which are the pungent  principles of red pepper. this inhibition was correlated with the presence of an  energy transducing site in this segment of the respiratory chain. where the nadh-quinone oxidoreductase segment involved an energy coupling site (e.g., in paracoccus denitrificans, escherichia coli, and thermus thermophilus hb-8 membranes and bovine heart mitochondria), capsaicin acted as an inhibitor of ubiquinone reduction by nadh. in contrast, where this energy coupling site was absent (e.g., in saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria and bacillus subtilis membranes), there was no inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity by capsaicin. the capsaicin inhibition of paracoccus membranes was reversed by washing the membranes with medium containing bovine serum albumin. in the e. coli and paracoccus membranes and bovine submitochondrial particles, capsaicin acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor for ubiquinone-1 at lower concentrations of ubiquinone-1 (less than 20 microm) and as a competitive inhibitor at higher concentrations of ubiquinone-1 (greater than 50 microm). in addition, the concentrations of capsaicin required for 50% inhibition of nadh oxidase activity  of bovine submitochondrial particles were increased when ubiquinone-10 was added  to the particles. the mechanism by which capsaicin inhibits the energy-transducing nadh-quinone oxidoreductase is discussed.

TI  == the sequence of the cyo operon indicates substantial structural similarities between the cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase of escherichia coli and the aa3-type family of cytochrome c oxidases.
AB  == the cytochrome o complex is one of two ubiquinol oxidases in the aerobic respiratory system of escherichia coli. this enzyme catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol-8 which is located in the cytoplasmic membrane, and the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. the purified oxidase contains at least four subunits by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and has been shown to couple electron flux to the generation of a proton motive force across the membrane. in this paper, the dna sequence of the cyo operon, containing the structural genes for the oxidase, is reported. this operon is shown to encode five open reading frames, cyoabcde. the  gene products of three of these, cyoa, cyob, and cyoc, are clearly related to subunits ii, i, and iii, respectively, of the eukaryotic and prokaryotic aa3-type cytochrome c oxidases. this family of cytochrome c oxidases contain heme a and copper as prosthetic groups, whereas the e. coli enzyme contains heme b (protoheme ix) and copper. the most striking sequence similarities relate the large subunits (i) of both the e. coli quinol oxidase and the cytochrome c oxidases. it is likely that the sequence similarities reflect a common molecular  architecture of the two heme binding sites and of a copper binding site in these  enzymes. in addition, the cyoe open reading frame is closely related to a gene denoted orf1 from paracoccus dentrificans which is located in between the genes encoding subunits ii and iii of the cytochrome c oxidase of this organism. the function of the orf1 gene product is not known. these sequence relationships define a superfamily of membrane-bound respiratory oxidases which share structural features but which have different functions. the e. coli cytochrome o  complex oxidizes ubiquinol but has no ability to catalyze the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c. nevertheless, it is clear that the e. coli oxidase and the  aa3-type cytochrome c oxidases must have very similar structures, at least in the vicinity of the catalytic centers, and they are very likely to have similar mechanisms for bioenergetic coupling (proton pumping).

TI  == paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c1 gene replacement mutants.
AB  == we describe the construction and characterization of gene replacement mutants for the respiratory chain component cytochrome c1 in the bacterium paracoccus denitrificans. its structural gene (fbcc) was inactivated by insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene, introduced into a suicide vector, and conjugated into  paracoccus; chromosomal mutants obtained by homologous recombination were selected by antibiotic resistance screening and further characterized biochemically. they showed the complete spectral, enzymatic, and immunological loss of the fbcc gene product together with a serious defect in the assembly of the two other gene products of the fbc operon, cytochrome b and the fes protein.  a possible role of the cytochrome c1 in the assembly process for the enzyme complex is discussed. a functional restoration to wild-type phenotype was achieved by complementing in trans with a newly constructed broad-host-range vector carrying the fbcc gene cassette. when the complete fbc operon was present  on this vector, overexpression of complex iii subunits was observed. apart from their physiological significance, such mutants are a prerequisite for probing structure-function relationships by site-directed mutagenesis in order to understand molecular details of electron transport and energy transduction processes of this respiratory enzyme in bacteria and in mitochondria.

TI  == are there isoenzymes of cytochrome c oxidase in paracoccus denitrificans?
AB  == we have used a gene replacement strategy to delete the previously isolated gene [(1987) embo j. 6, 2825-2833] for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit i from paracoccus denitrificans. the resulting mutant was still able to synthesize active cytochrome c oxidase. this led us to look for another locus which could completely suppress the mutation. in this study we report the isolation of a second gene encoding subunit i. an open reading frame coding for cytochrome c 550 was found upstream from this gene. we suggest that there are isoenzymes of cytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome aa3) in this bacterium.

TI  == mutagenesis of the gene encoding cytochrome c550 of paracoccus denitrificans and  analysis of the resultant physiological effects.
AB  == by using synthetic oligonucleotides, the gene encoding soluble cytochrome c550 was isolated from a genomic bank of paracoccus denitrificans. the nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature protein was found to be similar to the primary structure of purified cytochrome c550 except for the presence of seven additional amino acid residues at the c terminus. at the n terminus of the primary structure was found an additional stretch of 19 amino acid residues that had the typical features of the signal sequence of the cytochrome. comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the  upstream regions of the p. denitrificans cytochrome c550 gene and bc1 operon revealed three regions with a distinct organization that showed strong similarity. downstream of the c550 gene was found part of another gene, the deduced amino acid sequence of which showed strong homology with subunit 1 of the cytochrome aa3 oxidase. for gene replacement experiments, the suicide vector pgrpd1 was constructed. the cytochrome c550 gene was inactivated by insertion of  a kanamycin resistance gene, and the mutated gene was cloned into this vector. recombination with the wild-type gene resulted in a mutant strain with an inactivated cytochrome gene. isolated mutant strains were unable to synthesize the soluble cytochrome, as judged by spectrum analysis and analysis of periplasmic proteins by gel electrophoresis and heme staining. the mutation resulted in a 14% decrease in the growth yield during aerobic heterotrophic growth and in a 40% decrease in the maximum specific growth rate during growth on methylamine. furthermore, a longer lag phase was observed under both growth conditions. the mutation had no effect on growth yield, maximum specific growth rate, and duration of the lag phase during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate. in addition, there was no accumulation of nitrite and nitrous oxide.

TI  == transposable elements for efficient manipulation of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria: promoter probes and vectors for foreign genes.
AB  == we describe here the construction and use of a series of modified transposons based on the insertion sequence is1. like their parent, omegon-km [fellay et al., gene 76 (1989) 215-226], these elements permit efficient insertional mutagenesis  of a variety of gram-negative bacteria. the presence of a functional pbr322 origin of replication within the transposable element facilitates subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. the omegon-km system was previously shown to function in pseudomonas putida, rhizobium leguminosarum and paracoccus denitrificans. the results we present here demonstrate that its use can be extended to xanthomonas campestris, a plant pathogen, and to the microaeroduric zymomonas mobilis. derivative transposons carrying unique restriction sites for scai, ndei, xbai and xhoi have been constructed, allowing the cloning and introduction of foreign genes. we have also constructed two derivatives which can be used to generate operon fusions upon insertion and are thus useful for isolating and characterising indigenous promoters. one carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (cat)-encoding gene (cat) and the second, the  entire promoterless escherichia coli lac operon. we demonstrate the utility of the cat promoter probe in x. campestris to target conditional promoters inducible by high salt or subject to repression by glucose.

TI  == cytochrome o (bo) is a proton pump in paracoccus denitrificans and escherichia coli.
AB  == spheroplasts from aerobically grown wild-type paracoccus denitrificans cells respire with succinate despite specific inhibition of the cytochrome bc1 complex  by myxothiazol. coupled to this activity, which involves only b-type cytochromes, there is translocation of 1.5-1.9 h+/e- across the cytoplasmic membrane. similar  h+ translocation ratios are observed during oxidation of ubiquinol in spheroplasts from aerobically grown mutants of paracoccus lacking cytochrome c oxidase, or deficient in cytochrome c, as well as in a strain of e. coli from which cytochrome d was deleted. these observations show that the cytochrome o complex is a proton pump much like cytochrome aa3 to which it is structurally related.

TI  == the amino acid sequence of adenylate kinase from paracoccus denitrificans and its relationship to mitochondrial and microbial adenylate kinases.
AB  == the complete amino acid sequence of adenylate kinase (mgatp + amp in equilibrium  mgadp + adp) from paracoccus denitrificans has been determined. 1. the s-[14c]carboxymethylated protein was cleaved with clostripain, cyanogen bromide and endoproteinase lys-c; 18, 9 and 6 fragments, respectively, were analyzed. some of these peptides were further degraded by trypsin, staphylococcus aureus v8 protease and carboxypeptidases a and b. the fragments were separated by hplc and  sequenced with a gas-phase sequencer. 2. sequencing the whole unblocked protein yielded the n-terminal region. the c-terminal residues were obtained by carboxypeptidase-y digestion in agreement with the sequence of tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides. 3. the final sequence shows 217 amino acids with mr =  23,609 and contains one free cysteine and a disulfide bond. 4. the comparison of  the p. denitrificans sequence with other known adenylate kinases shows highest similarity with the structurally known escherichia coli enzyme (47%). the only and catalytically relevant his in the paracoccal enzyme is close to the site of binding of adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine to e. coli adenylate kinase. the disulfide bridge is located in the 30-residue segment, which is indicative of the large variants and is absent in cytosolic adenylate kinase. the similarity to the mitochondrial intermembrane-space and matrix adenylate kinase isoenzymes is only 40% and 30%, respectively, while 39% of redidues are identical to those of yeast cytosolic adenylate kinase. therefore, adenylate kinases do not support the hypothesis of a close relationship between paracoccus and mitochondria.

TI  == omegon-km: a transposable element designed for in vivo insertional mutagenesis and cloning of genes in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == to combine the features of the omega interposons with the advantages of in vivo transposition mutagenesis, we have constructed an artificial transposon, called omegon-km. the omegon-km transposon is carried on the plasmid pjff350 which can be conjugally mobilized into a broad range of gram-negative bacteria. omegon-km is flanked, in inverted orientation, by synthetic 28-bp repeats derived from the  ends of is1. in addition, each end of omegon-km has the very efficient transcription and translation terminators of the omega interposon. internally, omegon-km carries the selectable kanamycin (km)-neomycin resistance gene (alph a) which is expressed well in many gram-negative bacteria. the is1 transposition functions are located on the donor plasmid but external to omegon-km. thus, insertions of omegon-km are very stable because they lack the capacity for further transposition. omegon-km mutagenesis is performed by conjugal transfer of pjff350 from escherichia coli into any gram-negative recipient strain in which this plasmid is unable to replicate. those cells which have had a transposition event are selected by their resistance to km. very high frequencies of omegon-km  transposition were observed in pseudomonas putida. preliminary experiments with other gram-negative soil and water bacteria (rhizobium leguminosarum, paracoccus  denitrificans) yielded mutants at reasonable levels. the presence of an e. coli-specific origin of replication (ori) within omegon-km allows the rapid and easy cloning, in e. coli, of the nucleotide sequences flanking the site of the transposition event.

TI  == inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and correlation of this inhibition with the occurrence of energy-coupling site 1  in various organisms.
AB  == the nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity of the respiratory chains of several organisms was inhibited by the carboxyl-modifying reagent n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd). this inhibition correlated with the presence of an energy-transducing site in this segment of the respiratory chain.  where the nadh-quinone reductase segment involved an energy-coupling site (e.g.,  in bovine heart and rat liver mitochondria, and in paracoccus denitrificans, escherichia coli, and thermus thermophilus hb-8 membranes), dccd acted as an inhibitor of ubiquinone reduction by nadh. by contrast, where energy-coupling site 1 was absent (e.g., in saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria and bacillus subtilis membranes), there was no inhibition of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity by dccd. in the bovine and p. denitrificans systems, dccd inhibition was pseudo first order with respect to incubation time, and reaction order with respect to inhibitor concentration was close to unity, indicating that inhibition resulted from the binding of one inhibitor molecule per active unit of nadh-ubiquinone reductase. in the bovine nadh-ubiquinone reductase complex (complex i), [14c]dccd was preferentially incorporated into two subunits of molecular weight 49,000 and 29,000. the time course of labeling of the 29,000 molecular weight subunit with [14c]dccd paralleled the time course of inhibition  of nadh-ubiquinone reductase activity.

TI  == interposon mutagenesis of soil and water bacteria: a family of dna fragments designed for in vitro insertional mutagenesis of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we have constructed a series of derivatives of the omega interposon [prentki and  krisch, gene 29 (1984) 303-313] that can be used for in vitro insertional mutagenesis. each of these dna fragments carries a different antibiotic or hg2+ resistance gene (apr, cmr, tcr, kmr or hgr) which is flanked, in inverted orientation, by transcription and translation termination signals and by synthetic polylinkers. the dna of these interposons can be easily purified and then inserted, by in vitro ligation, into a plasmid linearized either at random by dnase i or at specific sites by restriction enzymes. plasmid molecules which contain an interposon insertion can be identified by expression of its drug resistance. the position of the interposon can be precisely mapped by the restriction sites in the flanking polylinker. to verify their properties we have  used these omega derivatives to mutagenize a broad host range plasmid which contains the entire meta-cleavage pathway of the toluene degradation plasmid pww0 of pseudomonas putida. insertion of these interposons in the plasmid between the  promoter and the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (c23o) gene dramatically reduced the expression of this enzyme in escherichia coli. we also show that when a plasmid containing an omega interposon is transferred by conjugal mobilization from e. coli to p. putida, agrobacterium tumefaciens, erwinia chrysanthemi, paracoccus denitrificans or rhizobium leguminosarum, the appropriate interposon drug resistance is usually expressed and, compared to the non-mutated plasmid, much reduced levels of c23o activity are detected. thus, the selection and/or characterization of omega insertional mutations can be carried out in these bacterial species.

TI  == the respiratory nitrate reductase from paracoccus denitrificans. molecular characterisation and kinetic properties.
AB  == the respiratory nitrate reductase from paracoccus denitrificans has been purified in the non-ionic detergent nonidet p-40. the enzyme comprises three polypeptides, alpha, beta and gamma with estimated relative molecular masses of 127 000, 61 000 and 21 000. duroquinol or reduced-viologen compounds acted as the reducing substrates. the nitrate reductase contained a b-type cytochrome that was reduced  by duroquinol and oxidised by nitrate. a preparation of the enzyme that lacked both detectable b-type cytochrome and the gamma subunit was obtained from a trailing peak of nitrate reductase activity collected from a gel filtration column. absence of the gamma subunit correlated with failure to use duroquinol as reductant; activity with reduced viologens was retained. it is concluded that in  the plasma membrane of p. denitrificans the gamma subunit catalyses electron transfer to the alpha and beta subunits of nitrate reductase from ubiquinol which acts as a branch point in the respiratory chain. a new assay was introduced for both nitrate and quinol-nitrate oxidoreductase activity. diaphorase was used to couple the oxidation of nadh to the production of duroquinol which acted as electron donor to nitrate reductase. under anaerobic conditions absorbance changes at 340 nm were sensitive to nitrate concentrations in the low micromolar  range. this coupled assay was used to determine that the purified enzyme had km(no-3) of 13 microm and a km of 470 microm for clo-3, an alternative substrate. with viologen substrates km(no-3) of 283 microm and km(clo-3) of 470 microm were  determined; the enzymes possessed a considerably higher vmax with either no-3 or  clo-3 than was found when duroquinol was substrate. azide was a competitive inhibitor of nitrate reduction in either assay system (ki = 0.55 microm) but 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline n-oxide was effective only with the complete three-subunit enzyme and duroquinol as substrate, consistent with a site of action for this inhibitor on the b-type cytochrome. the low km for nitrate observed in the duriquinol assay is comparable with the apparent km(no-3) recently reported for intact cells of p. denitrificans [parsonage, d., greenfield, a. j. & ferguson, s. j. (1985) biochim. biophys. acta 807, 81-95]. this similarity is discussed in terms of a possible requirement for a nitrate transport system. the nitrate reductase system from p. denitrificans is compared  with that from escherichia coli.

TI  == eubacteria have 3 growth modes keyed to nutrient flow. consequences for the concept of maintenance and maximal growth yield.
AB  == aerobic growth of escherichia coli and paracoccus denitrificans has been studied  in chemostat, fed batch, and recycling fermentor modes under carbon and energy limitation. two abrupt drops or discontinuities in molar growth yield, y, have been found that occur over relatively short ranges in the value of specific growth rate. before the first discontinuity, y is constant and maximal. after the first discontinuity, at a doubling time of 33 h, y becomes constant again and independent of mu until the second discontinuity appears at a doubling time of about 50 h, corresponding to a mu of about 0.014. at this point, y drops to a lower value that is constant at doubling times longer than 100 h, corresponding to a mu of about 0.007. the second discontinuity is associated in paracoccus with elevated levels of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppgpp) that impose stringent regulation as has been found previously with bacillus and escherichia species. it is thus likely that the stringent response generally occurs in bacteria in vivo at a doubling time of about 50 h. the cause of the first discontinuity is unknown. all experiments indicate that pirt-type calculations relating mu, y, and maintenance energy demand are no longer valid. in chemostat experiments, the intercept of the relationship between specific substrate utilization and specific growth rate is defined as maintenance. however, this intercept most probably is caused by stringent regulation at low dilution rates. three regions of bacterial  growth rates are defined by this study, corresponding to doubling times of 0.5 to 15 h, 33 to 50 h, and greater than 100 h. some growth behavior in each region is  unique to that region.

TI  == estimation with an ion-selective electrode of the membrane potential in cells of  paracoccus denitrificans from the uptake of the butyltriphenylphosphonium cation  during aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
AB  == 1. aerobic respiration by cells of paracoccus dentrificans drives the uptake of the lipophilic cation butyltriphenylphosphonium. anaerobiosis or addition of an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) results in efflux of the cation. changes in the concentration of butyltriphenylphosphonium in the suspension medium were measured by using an ion-selective electrode, the construction of which is described. 2. if the uptake of butyltriphenylphosphonium is used as an indicator  of membrane potential, then at ph 7.3 an estimate of about 160 mv is obtained for cells of p. dentrificans respiring aerobically in 100 mm-hepes [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulphonic acid/naoh or 100mm-nah2po4/naoh. this potential, however, is decreased by more than 20 mv in reaction media containing a high concentration of phosphate (100 mm) together with at least 1 mm-k+. 3. anaerobic electron transport with no3-, no2- or n2o as terminal electron acceptor generates a membrane potential of about 150mv in described suspension media. the presence of these species under aerobic conditions, moreover, has negligible effect upon the extent of uptake of butyltriphenylphosphonium normally driven by aerobic respiration. these data indicate that none of these molecules exert a significant uncoupling effect on the protonmotive force. 4. no 204tl+ uptake into respiring cells was detected. this adds to the evidence that 204tl+ is not a freely permeable cation in bacterial cells and therefore not an indicator of membrane potential as has been  proposed. the absence of respiration-driven 204tl+ uptake indicates that p. denitrificans cells grown under the conditions specified in the present work do not possess k+-transport systems of either the kdp or trka types that have been described in escherichia coli.

AB  == centrifugation of membrane vesicles, prepared from ultrasonically disrupted escherichia coli k12, on to a planar surface followed by slow, partial dehydration results in a high degree of parallel orientation of the membrane planes with respect to each other and the supporting surface. rotation of such membrane multilayers about a single axis parallel with the membrane planes within the magnetic field of an electron paramagnetic resonance (e.p.r.) spectrometer allows the orientation of anisotropic paramagnetic centres to be deduced. computer simulations of the angular dependence of cytochrome e.p.r. spectra show  two, or perhaps three, cytochromes, well-oriented with respect to the membrane plane. a low-spin cytochrome is oriented with the normal to its haem plane lying  in the membrane plane. one (or perhaps two) high-spin cytochrome(s) lies with its haem plane making an angle of 45 degrees with the membrane plane. the orientation of the low-spin cytochrome haem is thus the same as that of haems in b-type cytochromes and cytochrome oxidases of the a type found in the mitochondria of higher animal and microbial cells and the bacterium paracoccus denitrificans (erecinska et al., 1979). the possible identity of this low-spin component as the terminal oxidase, cytochrome o, is discussed.

TI  == substrate binding site for nitrate reductase of escherichia coli is on the inner  aspect of the membrane.
AB  == escherichia coli grown anaerobically on nitrate exhibited the same transport barrier to reduction of chlorate, relative to nitrate, as that exhibited by paracoccus denitrificans. this establishes that the nitrate binding site of nitrate reductase (ec 1.7.99.4) in e. coli must also lie on the cell side of the  nitrate transporter which is associated with the plasma membrane. because nitrate reductase is membrane bound, the nitrate binding site is thus located on the inner aspect of the membrane. nitrate pulse studies on e. coli in the absence of  valinomycin showed a small transient alkalinization (leads to h+/no3- congruent to --0.07) which did not occur with oxygen pulses. by analogy with p. denitrificans, the alkaline transient is interpreted to arise from proton-linked  nitrate uptake which is closely followed by nitrite efflux. the result is consistent with internal reduction of nitrate, whereas external reduction would be expected to give leads to h+/no3-ratios approaching --2.

TI  == reduction of iron and synthesis of protoheme by spirillum itersonii and other organisms.
AB  == membranes from spirillum itersonii reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or succinate as a source of reductant.  iron reduction was measured spectrophotometrically at 562 nm using ferrozine, which chelates ferrous iron specifically. reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or succinate was also effective as a source of iron. the effects of  respiratory inhibitors suggested that reduction of iron occurs at one or more sites on the respiratory chain before cytochrome c. reduction of iron and synthesis of protoheme with the physiological reductants were also observed with  crude extracts of other bacteria, including rhodopseudomonas spheroides, rhodopseudomonas capsulata, paracoccus denitrificans, and escherichia coli. the effect of oxygen upon reduction of iron and formation of protoheme was examined with membranes from s. itersonii, using succinate as a source of reductant. both  systems were inhibited by oxygen, but this effect was completely reversed by addition of antimycin a. we conclude that reduced components of the respiratory chain serve as reductants for ferric iron, but with oxygen present they are oxidized preferentially by the successive members of the chain. this could be a mechanism for regulating synthesis of heme and cytochrome by oxygen.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial respiration monitored by electrodes.
AB  == a technique is described by which both oxygen and nitrate (or nitrate or chlorate) levels were continuously monitored during bacterial respiration. paracoccus (micrococcus) denitrificans and escherichia coli oxidizing succinate rapidly ceased to reduce nitrate when oxygen was available, and equally rapidly commenced nitrate reduction when all the oxygen had been consumed. by contrast, membrane vesicles isolated from p. denitrificans reduced oxygen and nitrate simultaneously. the respiratory nitrate reductase in intact cells of p. denitrificans appeared to be inacessible to chlorate present in the reaction medium, and it is suggested that the nitrate reductase is orientated on the plasma membrane so that nitrate gains access from the inner (cytosolic) face.

TI  == pathway of thiamine pyrophosphate synthesis in micrococcus denitrificans.
AB  == the pathway of thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp) biosynthesis, which is formed either  from exogeneously added thiamine or from the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties of  thiamine, in micrococcus denitrificans was investigated. the following indirect evidence shows that thiamine pyrophosphokinase (ec 2.7.6.2) catalyzes the synthesis of tpp from thiamine: (i) [35s]thiamine incubated with cells of this microorganism was detected in the form of [35s]thiamine; (ii) thiamine gave a much faster rate of tpp synthesis than thiamine monophosphate (tmp) when determined with the extracts; and (iii) a partially purified preparation of the extracts can use thiamine, but not tmp, as the substrate. the activities of the four enzymes involved in tmp synthesis from pyrimidine and thiazole moieties of thiamine were detected in the extracts of m. denitrificans. the extracts contained a high activity of the phosphatase, probably specific for tmp. after m. denitrificans cells were grown on a minimal medium containing 3 mm adenosine, which causes derepression of de novo thiamine biosynthesis in escherichia coli, the activities of the four enzymes involved with tmp synthesis, the tmp phosphatase, and the thiamine pyrophosphokinase were enhanced two- to threefold.  these results indicate that tpp is synthesized directly from thiamine without forming tmp as an intermediate and that de novo synthesis of tpp from the pyrimidine and thiazole moieties involves the formation of tmp, followed by hydrolysis to thiamine, which is then converted to tpp directly. thus, the pathway of tpp synthesis from tmp synthesized de novo in m. denitrificans is different from that found in e. coli, in which tmp synthesized de novo is converted directly to tpp without producing thiamine.

TI  == metal accumulation by bacteria with particular reference to dissimilatory sulphate-reducing bacteria.
AB  == dissimilatory sulphate-reducing bacteria, genera desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum, exhibit a superior ability, over assimilatory organisms, to extract three amounts of metals from culture media. this property does not appear to be solely a function of the presence of h2s. in media containing elevated amounts of fe, electron dense particles, provisionally identified as fes, are deposited within the cells of dissimilatory bacteria.
