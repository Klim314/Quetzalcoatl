TI  - 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis, and mass spectrometry identification of the proposed new species "Clostridium neonatale".
AB  - In 2002, an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis in a Canadian neonatal intensive care unit was associated with a proposed novel species of Clostridium, "Clostridium neonatale." To date, there are no data about the isolation, identification, or clinical significance of this species. Additionally, C. neonatale has not been formally classified as a new species, rendering its identification challenging. Indeed, the C. neonatale 16S rRNA gene sequence shows high similarity to another Clostridium species involved in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, Clostridium butyricum. By performing a polyphasic study combining phylogenetic analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing and multilocus sequence analysis) and phenotypic characterization with mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that C. neonatale is a new species within the Clostridium genus sensu stricto, for which we propose the name Clostridium neonatale sp. nov. Now that the status of C. neonatale has been clarified, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be used for better differential identification of C. neonatale and C. butyricum clinical isolates. This is necessary to precisely define the role and clinical significance of C. neonatale, a species that may have been misidentified and underrepresented during previous neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis studies.
TI  - Impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production in an up-flow anaerobic  packed bed reactor (UAnPBR).
AB  - This study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen production  from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor (UAnPBR). Two mesophilic UAPBRs (UAnPBR1 and 2) were tested at organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 g COD L(-1)d(-1). To overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the UAnPBR2 to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. The design modifications in UAnPBR2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98 to 2.0 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose at an OLR of 25.7 g COD L(-1)d(-1). Although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 L H2 L(-1)d(-1) was achieved in the UAnPBR2 at an OLR of 51.4 g COD L(-1)d(-1), the hydrogen yield dropped by 50% to around 1 mol-H2 mol(-1)-glucose. The microbiological analysis (PCR/DGGE) showed that the biohydrogen production was due to the presence of the hydrogen and volatile acid producers such as Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Propionispira arboris.
TI  - The influence of fat and monoacylglycerols on growth of spore-forming bacteria in processed cheese.
AB  - Highly undesirable microbial contaminants of processed cheese are endospore-forming bacteria of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium. Survival of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Clostridium butyricum and C. sporogenes was examined in model processed cheese samples supplemented with monoacylglycerols. In processed cheese samples, monoacylglycerols of undecanoic, undecenoic, lauric and adamantane-1-carboxylic acid at concentration of 0.15% w/w prevented the growth and multiplication of both Bacillus species throughout the storage period. The two species of Clostridium were less affected by monoacylglycerols in processed cheese samples and only partial inhibition was observed. The effect of milk fat content on microbial survival in processed cheese was also evaluated. The growth of Bacillus sp. was affected by the fat level of processed cheese while population levels of Clostridium sp. did not differ in processed cheese samples with 30, 40 and 50% fat in dry matter.
TI  - Direct bioconversion of raw corn stalk to hydrogen by a new strain Clostridium sp. FS3.
AB  - A new strain FS3 which could achieve an efficient bioconversion of raw corn stalk to hydrogen had been isolated from anaerobic acclimated sludge, and identified as Clostridium butyricum on the basis of a series of physiological and biochemical experiments and 16S rDNA gene sequence. The strain could utilize various carbon sources to produce hydrogen. On the basis of single-factor experiments, the response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to optimize the media for hydrogen production. The maximum hydrogen yield of 92.9ml/g was observed under the optimal conditions: 20g/l raw corn stalk, 1.76g/l NH4HCO3, 0.91g/l KH2PO4 and 10.4ml/l nutrient solution. This finding opens a new avenue for direct conversion of raw cellulosic biomass to bio-hydrogen.
TI  - Characterization of Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus Clostridium into the genera Romboutsia gen. nov., Intestinibacter gen. nov., Terrisporobacter gen. nov. and Asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  - A Gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated CRIBT, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. The major cellular fatty acids of strain CRIBT were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain C12-C19 fatty acids, with C16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. The polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the specific spray reagents used. The only quinone was MK-6. The predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. The peptidoglycan type of strain CRIBT was A1sigma lanthionine-direct. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CRIBT was 28.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CRIBT was most closely related to a number of species of the genus Clostridium, including Clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), Clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), Clostridium mayombei (96.2%), Clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and Clostridium irregulare (95.5%). All these species show very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. DNA-DNA hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. On the basis of phenotypic and genetic studies, a novel genus, Romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. The novel isolate CRIBT (=DSM 25109T=NIZO 4048T) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. It is proposed that C. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as Romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. Furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is proposed for C. bartlettii, as Intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. glycolicum, as Terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. mayombei, as Terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and C. irregulare, as Asaccharospora irregularis gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. In addition, an emendation of the species Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order Eubacteriales is provided.
TI  - A gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. Bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. As a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. RESULTS: In this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). We monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. All patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. Only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from Acidaminococcus sp., Eubacterium sp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. Two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of Clostridium butyricum and C. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. Most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, our analysis refines but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.
TI  - Unraveling the dha cluster in Citrobacter werkmanii: comparative genomic analysis of bacterial 1,3-propanediol biosynthesis clusters.
AB  - In natural 1,3-propanediol (PDO) producing microorganisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Clostridium sp., the genes coding for PDO producing enzymes are grouped in a dha cluster. This article describes the dha cluster of a novel candidate for PDO production, Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579 and compares the cluster to the currently known PDO clusters of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae. Moreover, we attribute a putative function to two previously unannotated ORFs, OrfW and OrfY, both in C. freundii and in C. werkmanii: both proteins might form a complex and support the glycerol dehydratase by converting cob(I)alamin to the glycerol dehydratase cofactor coenzyme B12. Unraveling this biosynthesis cluster revealed high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames of C. werkmanii DSM17579 and those of C. freundii DSM30040 and K. pneumoniae MGH78578, i.e., 96 and 87.5 % identity, respectively. On the other hand, major differences between the clusters have also been discovered. For example, only one dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) is present in the dha cluster of C. werkmanii DSM17579, while two DHAK enzymes are present in the cluster of K. pneumoniae MGH78578 and Clostridium butyricum VPI1718.
TI  - Protein identification in two phases of 1,3-propanediol production by proteomic analysis.
AB  - Proteomic analysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D)-mass spectrometry was  used to identify differentially expressed proteins in the Clostridium sp. native strain (IBUN 158B) in two phases of the 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production (lag phase and exponential growth phase). Intracellular protein fraction extraction conditions were standardised, as well as the 2D electrophoresis. Differences were found between both of the growth phases evaluated here. Thirty-two of the differentially expressed proteins were chosen to be identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF). The presence of four enzymes implicated in the 1,3-PD metabolic pathway was recorded: one from the reductive route (1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase) and three from the oxidative route (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase and phosphate butyryl transferase). The following enzymes which have not been previously reported for Clostridium sp., were also identified: phosphoglycerate kinase, glucose 6-phosphate isomerase, deoxyribose phosphate aldolase, transketolase, cysteine synthetase, O-acetylhomoserine sulphhydrylase, glycyl-tRNA ligase, aspartate-beta-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase, aconitate hydratase and the PrsA protein. The foregoing provides a novel contribution towards knowledge of the native strain for the purpose of designing genetic manipulation strategies to obtain strains with high production of 1,3-PD. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The article "Protein identification in two phases of 1,3-propanediol production by proteomic analysis" provides a novel contribution towards knowledge regarding the Colombian Clostridium sp. native strain (IBUN 158B) because this is a new approximation in comparative proteomics in two phases of the bacterial growth and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production conditions. The proteomic studies are very important to identify the enzymes that are expressed at different stages of production and therefore genes of interest in the genetic manipulation strategies; the results can be taken into account in future studies in metabolic engineering when optimising 1,3-PD production, in a cost-effective process having direct industrial applications.
TI  - Microbial consortia for hydrogen production enhancement.
AB  - Ten efficient hydrogen-producing strains affiliated to the Clostridium genus were used to develop consortia for hydrogen production. In order to determine their saccharolytic and proteolytic activities, glucose and meat extract were tested as fermentation substrates, and the best hydrogen-producing strains were selected. The C. roseum H5 (glucose-consuming) and C. butyricum R4 (protein-degrading) co-culture was the best hydrogen-producing co-culture. The end-fermentation products for the axenic cultures and co-cultures were analyzed. In all cases, organic acids, mainly butyrate and acetate, were produced lowering the pH and thus inhibiting further hydrogen production. In order to replace the need for reducing agents for the anaerobic growth of clostridia, a microbial consortium including Clostridium spp. and an oxygen-consuming microorganism able to form dense granules (Streptomyces sp.) was created. Increased yields of hydrogen were achieved. The effect of adding a butyrate-degrading bacteria and an acetate-consuming archaea to the consortia was also studied.
TI  - Long-term effect of inoculum pretreatment on fermentative hydrogen production by  repeated batch cultivations: homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis as competitors to hydrogen production.
AB  - Long-term effects of inoculum pretreatments (heat, acid, loading-shock) on hydrogen production from glucose under different temperatures (37 degrees C, 55 degrees C) and initial pH (7 and 5.5) were studied by repeated batch cultivations. Results obtained showed that it was necessary to investigate the long-term effect of inoculum pretreatment on hydrogen production since pretreatments may just temporarily inhibit the hydrogen consuming processes. After long-term cultivation, pretreated inocula did not enhance hydrogen production compared to untreated inocula under mesophilic conditions (initial pH 7 and pH 5.5) and thermophilic conditions (initial pH 7). However, pretreatment could inhibit lactate production and lead to higher hydrogen yield under thermophilic conditions at initial pH 5.5. The results further demonstrated that inoculum pretreatment could not permanently inhibit either methanogenesis or homoacetogenesis, and methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis could only be inhibited by proper control of fermentation pH and temperature. Methanogenic activity could be inhibited at pH lower than 6, both under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, while homoacetogenic activity could only be inhibited under thermophilic condition at initial pH 5.5. Microbial community analysis showed that pretreatment did not affect the dominant bacteria. The dominant bacteria were Clostridium butyricum related organisms under mesophilic condition (initial pH 7 and 5.5), Thermoanaerobacterium sp. related organisms under thermophilic condition (initial pH 7), and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum related organisms under thermophilic condition (initial pH 5.5). Results from this study clearly indicated that the long-term effects of inoculum pretreatments on hydrogen production, methanogenesis, homoacetogenesis and dominant bacteria were dependent on fermentation temperature and pH.
TI  - Investigation of mineral water springs of Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) region (Romania) with cultivation-dependent microbiological methods.
AB  - Water samples of ten mineral water springs at Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) region (Romania) were examined during 2005-2006 using cultivation-dependent microbiological methods. The results of standard hygienic bacteriological tests showed that the Hargita Spring had perfect and five other springs had microbiologically acceptable water quality (Zsogod-, Nagy-borviz-, Taploca-, Szentegyhaza- and Lobogo springs). The water of Borsaros Spring was exceptionable (high germ count, presence of Enterococcus spp.).Both standard bacteriological and molecular microbiological methods indicated that the microbiological water quality of the Szeltersz-, Nadasszek- and Delo springs was not acceptable. Bad water quality resulted from inadequate spring catchment and hygiene (low yield, lack of runoff, negligent usage of the springs, horse manure around the spring).The 16S rRNA gene-based identification of strains isolated on standard meat-peptone medium resulted in the detection of typical aquatic organisms such as Shewanella baltica, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas veronii, Psychrobacter sp,. Acinetobacter spp. and allochthonous microbes, like Nocardia, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Microbacterium , and Arthrobacter strains indicating the impact of soil. Other allochthonous microbes, such as Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus sp., Lactococcus sp., Clostridium butyricum, Yersinia spp., Aerococcus sp., may have originated from animal/human sources.
TI  - The isolation and microbial community analysis of hydrogen producing bacteria from activated sludge.
AB  - AIMS: To profile the fractions of bacteria in heat-treated activated sludge capable of producing hydrogen and subsequently to isolate those organisms and confirm their ability to produce hydrogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: Profiling the community composition of the microflora in activated sludge using 16S rRNA gene-directed polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis suggested that a majority of bacteria were various Clostridium species. This was confirmed by clone library analysis, where 80% of the cloned inserts were Clostridium sp. A total of five isolates were established on solid media. Three of them, designated as W1, W4 and W5, harboured the hydrogenase gene as determined by PCR and DNA sequence analysis (99% similarity). These isolates were similar to Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium diolis as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence. A maximum hydrogen production yield of 220 ml H(2) g(-1) glucose was achieved by W5, which was grown on improved mineral medium by batch fermentation without pH adjustment and nitrogen sparging during fermentation. Accumulation of malic acid and fumaric acid during hydrogen fermentation might lead to higher hydrogen yields for W4 and W5. W1 is the first reported Clostridium species that can tolerate microaerobic conditions for producing hydrogen. CONCLUSION: Clostridium species in heat-treated activated sludge were the most commonly identified bacteria responsible for hydrogen production. Specific genetic markers for strains W1, W4 and W5 would be of great utility in investigating hydrogen production at the molecular level. Two previously described primer sets targeting hydrogenase genes were shown not to be specific, amplifying other genes from nonhydrogen producers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Clostridium species isolated from heat-treated activated sludge were confirmed as hydrogen producers during dark hydrogen fermentation. The isolates will be useful for studying hydrogen production from wastewater, including the process of gene regulation and hydrogenase activity.
TI  - Dark H2 fermentation from sucrose and xylose using H2-producing indigenous bacteria: feasibility and kinetic studies.
AB  - Cellulosic materials are the major components in biomass feedstock used for bioenergy production. Hydrolytic products of cellulosic substances consist primarily of hexose (e.g., glucose) and pentose (e.g., xylose). In this study, the efficiency of fermentative conversion of sucrose (representing hexose) and xylose into H2 was examined with seven H2-producing pure strains isolated from a high-rate H2-producing system in our recent work. The isolates were identified as Clostridium butyricum (strains CGS2 and CGS5), Clostridium pasteurianum (strains CH1, CH4, CH5, and CH7), and Klebsiella sp. Batch H2 fermentation shows that only Cl. butyricum and Klebsiella sp. strains could utilize xylose for H2 production, while all of them can grow and produce H2 on sucrose. Among all strains examined, Cl. butyricum CGS5 was the best H2 producer on xylose with the highest H2 production rate and yield of 212.5 ml/h/l and 0.73 mol H2/mol xylose, respectively, taking place at 20 g COD/l of xylose. In contrast, Cl. pasteurianum CH4 was most efficient in converting sucrose to H2; the highest H2 production rate (569 ml/h/l) and yield (2.07 mol H2/mol hexose) were obtained at a sucrose concentration of 40 g COD/l. The substrate preference of the H2-producing isolates was consistent with the bacterial community structure that existed in the bioreactor, showing that Cl. butyricum and Cl. pasteurianum were predominant in the cultures grown on xylose and sucrose, respectively. Irrespective of the carbon substrate used, butyrate and acetate were the predominant soluble metabolites. Shake-flask cultures displayed higher H2 productivity over static ones, indicating the importance of efficient mass transfer for H2 production. The dependence of cell growth and H2 production on carbon substrate concentration could be described by the proposed kinetic models with good agreements.
TI  - Clostridium aestuarii sp. nov., from tidal flat sediment.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic, halophilic, motile, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain HY-45-18(T), was isolated from a sediment sample of a tidal flat in Korea. The isolate produced butyric acid, propionic acid, glycerol and H(2) as fermentation end products from glucose. Strain HY-45-18(T) is halophilic as it was unable to grow in the absence of sea salts. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis clearly indicated that the tidal flat isolate is a member of cluster I of the order Clostridiales, which contains the type species of Clostridium, Clostridium butyricum. The closest phylogenetic neighbour of strain HY-45-18(T) was Clostridium ganghwense KCTC 5146(T) (96.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Several phenotypic characteristics can be readily used to differentiate the isolate from phylogenetically related clostridia. Therefore, strain HY-45-18(T) represents a novel species of the genus Clostridium, for which the name Clostridium aestuarii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HY-45-18(T) (=IMSNU 40129(T)=KCTC 5147(T)=JCM 13194(T)).
TI  - Clostridium saccharogumia sp. nov. and Lactonifactor longoviformis gen. nov., sp. nov., two novel human faecal bacteria involved in the conversion of the dietary phytoestrogen secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - Two anaerobic bacteria involved in the conversion of the plant lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside were isolated from faeces of a healthy male adult. The first isolate, strain SDG-Mt85-3Db, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic Gram-positive helically coiled rod. Based on 16S r RNA gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were Clostridium cocleatum (96.7% similarity) and Clostridium ramosum (96.6%). In contrast to these species, the isolate was devoid of alpha-galactosidase and -glucosidase and did not grow on maltose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and trehalose. The hypothesis that strain SDG-Mt85-3Db represents a new bacterial species of the Clostridium cluster XVIII was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridisation experiments. The G+C content of DNA of strain SDG-Mt85-3Db (30.7+/-0.8 mol%) was comparable with that of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. The name Clostridium saccharogumia is proposed for strain SDG-Mt85-3Db (=DSM 17460T=CCUG 51486T). The second isolate, strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6, was a mesophilic strictly anaerobic Gram-positive regular rod. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, its nearest relatives were Clostridium amygdalinum (93.3%), Clostridium saccharolyticum (93.1%) and Ruminococcus productus (93.0%). The isolate differed from these species in its ability to dehydrogenate enterodiol. It also possessed alpha-arabinosidase and -galactosidase and had a higher G+C content of DNA (48.0 mol%). According to these findings, it is proposed to create a novel genus, Lactonifactor, and a novel species, Lactonifactor longoviformis, to accommodate strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6. The type strain is DSM 17459T (=CCUG 51487T).
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial susceptibility of Clostridium difficile isolated from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen associated with outbreaks of pseudomembranous colitis and other intestinal disorders such as diarrhea. In this study, 181 stool samples from children with and without acute diarrhea were analysed. Eighteen children with acute diarrhea were positive to C. ramosum, C. difficile, C. limosum, C. clostridioforme, C. septicum, C. butyricum, C. innocuum and Clostridium sp. Nineteen children without diarrhea harbored C. ramosum, C. septicum, C. barattii, C. butyricum, C. innocuum, C. sphenoides, C. bifermentans, C. clostridioforme and C. paraputrificum. No patient with diarrhea harbored C. barattii, C. bifermentans, C. paraputrificum and C. sphenoides. In addition, ten C. difficile strains were detected in 5 (5.5%) of the children with diarrhea. Also, no children from control group harbored C. difficile, C. limosum and Clostridium sp. Most of the tested strains were resistant to all the used antimicrobial. Nine C. difficile were toxigenic on VERO cells and by multiplex PCR, six strains showed both toxin A and B genes and three strains showed only toxin B gene. In this study, the presence of C. difficile was not significant, and it is suggested the need of more studies to evaluate the role of clostridia or C. difficile play in the childhood diarrhea and these organisms must be looked for routinely and a periodic evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility should be performed.
TI  - Microbial hydrogen production from sweet potato starch residue.
AB  - Clostridium butyricum could produce hydrogen from a sweet potato starch residue upon supplementation of nitrogen sources. A repeated batch culture using a mixed culture of C. butyricum and Enterobacter aerogenes produced hydrogen with a yield of 2.4 mol H2/mol glucose under a controlled culture pH of 5.25 in a medium consisting of the sweet potato starch residue and 0.1% Polypepton without addition of any reducing agents. Rhodobacter sp. M-19 produced hydrogen from the supernatant of the culture broth obtained in the repeated batch culture containing C. butyricum and E. aerogenes when 50 microg/l Na2MoO4.2H2O and 20 mg/l EDTA were added to the supernatant and it was cultured under a controlled culture pH of 7.5. A high yield of hydrogen of 7.0 mol H2/mol glucose from the starch remaining in the starch residue was attained in two-step repeated batch cultures containing C. butyricum and E. aerogenes, and by Rhodobacter sp. M-19.
TI  - [Phenotype and genotype of Clostridium sp. strains producing botulism neurotoxin].
AB  - Neurotoxins produced by strains of Clostridium sp. are belonging to the most toxic biological substances. In the study phenotypes and genotypes of C. botulinum strains in animal studies in vivo and on the DNA level were evaluated, respectively. Additionally, the presence of genes encoding BoNT toxins of A, B, and E types among strains of Clostridium sp. were identified. In case of C. botulinum DNA was isolated from vegetative bacterial cells and from spores. Two different genes encoding two different neurotoxins harboured by three strains of Ae biotype/ae genotype, and by two strains of B biotype/be genotype were detected. Additionally, above E type C. botulinum strains, the presence of gene encoding E type neurotoxin, was found in genome of two C. baratii, two C. butyricum, and C. bifidobacterium, and C. oedematicum strains. C. bifidobacterium and C. oedematicum strains positive for presence of gene encoding E type neurotoxin, were found negative for E neurotoxin production in vivo in TN test. The study indicates that genes encoding BoNT/E neurotoxins are very common among Clostridium species. Phenotype and genotype analysis indicated co-presence of B phenotype together with be genotype and A phenotype together with ae genotype among C. botulinum strains.
TI  - Clostridium colicanis sp. nov., from canine faeces.
AB  - Morphological, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown, anaerobic, rod-shaped organism isolated from faeces of a canine. The organism was tentatively identified as a member of the genus Clostridium based on its cellular morphology and ability to form endospores but, biochemically, it did not appear to correspond to any recognized species of this genus. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the bacterium represents a previously unrecognized subline within Clostridium rRNA group I (Clostridium sensu stricto), which includes Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus. The nearest phylogenetic relatives of the unknown bacterium corresponded to Clostridium absonum, Clostridium baratii, Eubacterium budayi, Eubacterium moniliforme, Eubacterium multiforme and Eubacterium nitritogenes, but 16S rRNA sequence divergence values of > 3% demonstrated that it represents a novel species. Based on the findings presented, a novel species, Clostridium colicanis sp. nov., is described, with the type strain 3WC2T (=CCUG 44556T =DSM 13634T).
TI  - Taxonomy of the glycerol fermenting clostridia and description of Clostridium diolis sp. nov.
AB  - Six Clostridium strains which ferment glycerol to 1,3-propanediol were tested for their taxonomic and phylogenetic relatedness. All but one were known as C butyricum. By physiological tests, 16S rDNA sequences and fatty acid composition two groups were distinguished. The first comprised the strains VPI 3266, DSM 2478 and DSM 523 (C. "kainantoi") and was consistent with the type strain of C. butyricum in almost all characters. The second group comprising the strains DSM 5430, DSM 5431 and E5 was related to C. beijerinckii. The 16S rDNAs of these strains were almost identical with that of the type strain of C. beijerinckii, DSM 791. The DNA-DNA hybridization value of DSM 5431 and ES with C. beijerinckii DSM 791 was markedly but not decisively lower (67 and 72%, respectively). However, there were significant physiological differences to C. beijerinckii which suggested to describe the strains as a separate species, Clostridium diolis with strain SH1 (= DSM 5431) as the type strain. The new species is distinguished from C. beijerinckii, which requires complex nutrients, by its ability to grow in glucose mineral medium with biotin as the only growth factor and by differences in substrate utilization. "C. kainantoi" Takeda and Matsui was recognized as a later synonym of C. butyricum.
TI  - [Combination use of kampo-medicines and drugs affecting intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The intestinal bacteria, Eubacterium sp. and Bifidobacterium sp., participate in  the metabolism of active kampo-ingredients, glycyrrhizin (GL), sennoside (SEN) and baicalin (BL). Since antibiotics and bacterial preparations, Bifidobacterium longum (LAC-B), Clostridium butyricum (MIYA-BM), and Streptococcus faecalis (BIOFERMIN), affect the bacterial population in intestinal bacterial flora, metabolism of the active kampo-ingredients in the bacterial flora may be altered by their combined administration. We investigated 1199 prescriptions including kampo-medicines for 308 patients. Combination use of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations occurred with 7% and 10% of the kampo-prescription, respectively. Most antibiotics have activity against intestinal bacteria, except that cephems and macrolides are not active against to E. coli. This means that antibiotics may lower the metabolism of GL, SEN and BL when administered in combination. On the other hand, it is also highly possible that bacterial preparations increase the number of Eubacterium sp. and Bifidobacterium sp., resulting in enhanced metabolism of GL and SEN when they are used concomitantly with kampo-medicines. The present results suggested that the drug interactions of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations should be confirmed in clinical studies.
TI  - New solvent-producing Clostridium sp. strains, hydrolyzing a wide range of polysaccharides, are closely related to Clostridium butyricum.
AB  - Thirteen new Clostridium strains, previously isolated from soil and found to produce high amounts of solvents from glucose, hydrolyzed a great variety of alpha- and beta-glycans, including raw starch, xylan, pectin, inulin and cellulose. The sequences of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments containing the variable 3' part of one of the 16S rRNA genes were 99.5% identical. The macrorestriction pattern of two endonucleolytic digests of chromosomal DNA in the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) confirmed their high homogeneity on the DNA level. The complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of three selected strains was 99.8% identical to the 16S rRNA gene sequence from Clostridium butyricum and separates them from C. acetobutylicum. To the closely related four species of solventogenic clostridia a new group of strains has to be added, which has a great potential for the direct fermentation of biomass.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - The gradostat: a bidirectional compound chemostat and its application in microbiological research.
AB  - A multistage continuous culture system is described in which solutes are transferred between vessels in opposite directions simultaneously. The system, called a gradostat, produces opposing solute gradients and is a good laboratory model of many natural microbial ecosystems in which solute gradients are important. Theoretical predictions concerning solute transfer were confirmed under steady-state and non steady-state conditions, using a coloured dye. Paracoccus denitrificans grew anaerobically in the gradostat at the intersection between opposing gradients of succinate and nitrate. Opposing gradients of glucose and oxygen separated the growth of a Bacillus sp. (a facultative anaerobe) and Clostridium butyricum (an obligate anaerobe). Viable counts for both species fell exponentially away from their growth positions at the ends of the gradostat. The potential value of the gradostat and possible alternative conformations are discussed.
TI  - CLOSTRIDIUM RUBRUM SP. N. AND OTHER PECTINOLYTIC CLOSTRIDIA FROM SOIL.
AB  - Ng, Henry (University of California, Davis) and Reese H. Vaughn. Clostridium rubrum sp. n. and other pectinolytic clostridia from soil. J. Bacteriol. 85:1104-1113. 1963.-Reports in the literature and results of experiments described herein suggest that pectinolytic anaerobes constitute a very heterogeneous group. The cultures isolated in this study all belonged to the genus Clostridium. The following species were identified: C. butyricum, C. fallax, C. multifermentans, and C. indolis. In addition, a species believed to be previously undescribed was named C. rubrum sp. n. The ability to ferment galacturonic acid was found to be adaptive. Some cultures fermented pectin and pectic acid to the same degree, whereas others fermented pectin only partially. The partial fermentation was attributed to the lack of a pectinesterase. On the basis of fermentation balances, it was concluded that the four strains of galacturonic acid fermenters selected for study yielded identical end products in approximately the same proportions. Per mole of galacturonic acid fermented, about 2 moles of CO(2), 1.5 moles of H(2), 1.5 moles of acetic acid, and 0.25 mole of butyric acid were produced.
