TI  == identification of yeast and bacteria involved in the mezcal fermentation of agave salmiana.
AB  == aims: to identify the yeast and bacteria present in the mezcal fermentation from  agave salmiana. methods and results: the restriction and sequence analysis of the amplified region, between 18s and 28s rdna and 16s rdna genes, were used for the  identification of yeast and bacteria, respectively. eleven different micro-organisms were identified in the mezcal fermentation. three of them were the following yeast: clavispora lusitaniae, pichia fermentans and kluyveromyces marxianus. the bacteria found were zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis and zymomonas mobilis subsp. pomaceae, weissella cibaria, weissella paramesenteroides, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus farraginis. conclusions: the phylogenetic analysis of 16s rdna and  its sequences showed that microbial diversity present in mezcal is dominated by bacteria, mainly lactic acid bacteria species and zymomonas mobilis. pichia fermentans and k. marxianus could be micro-organisms with high potential for the  production of some volatile compounds in mezcal. significance and impact of the study: we identified the community of bacteria and yeast present in mezcal fermentation from agave salmiana.
