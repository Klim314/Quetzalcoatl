TI  == periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence in origins: the oral infections,  glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance study.
AB  == periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus are known to be associated. the relationship between periodontal microbiota and early diabetes risk has not been  studied. we investigated the association between periodontal bacteria and prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults. origins (the oral infections,  glucose intolerance and insulin resistance study) cross sectionally enrolled 300  diabetes-free adults aged 20 to 55 y (mean +/- sd, 34 +/- 10 y; 77% female). prediabetes was defined as follows: 1) hemoglobin a1c values ranging from 5.7% to 6.4% or 2) fasting plasma glucose ranging from 100 to 125 mg/dl. in 1,188 subgingival plaque samples, 11 bacterial species were assessed at baseline, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and actinomyces naeslundii. full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were performed, and participants were defined as having no/mild periodontitis vs. moderate/severe periodontitis per the definition of the centers for disease control and prevention / american academy of periodontology. modified poisson regression evaluated prediabetes prevalence across bacterial tertiles. prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for third vs. first tertiles are presented. all analyses were adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors. all results presented currently arise from the baseline cross section. prediabetes prevalence was 18%, and 58% of participants had moderate/severe periodontitis. prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) summarizing associations between bacterial levels and prediabetes were as follows: a. actinomycetemcomitans, 2.48 (1.34, 4.58), p = 0.004; p. gingivalis, 3.41 (1.78, 6.58), p = 0.0003; t. denticola, 1.99 (0.992, 4.00), p = 0.052; t. forsythia, 1.95 (1.0, 3.84), p = 0.05; a. naeslundii, 0.46 (0.25, 0.85), p = 0.01. the prevalence ratio for prediabetes among participants with moderate/severe vs. no/mild periodontitis was 1.47 (0.78, 2.74), p = 0.23. higher colonization levels of specific periodontal microbiota are associated with higher prediabetes prevalence among diabetes-free adults.

TI  == full mouth periodontal debridement with or without adjunctive metronidazole gel in smoking patients with chronic periodontitis: a pilot study.
AB  == background and objective: the evidence of effectiveness of metronidazole (mtz) as an adjunct therapy to periodontal procedure in the treatment of patients with chronic periodontitis is not conclusive. the aim of this study was to compare the effect of mtz (delivered locally as a gel or systemically as a tablet) as an adjunctive therapy with full mouth periodontal debridement (1 h of ultrasonic calculus/plaque removal) in smokers with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: this pilot study involved 30 smokers with at least six teeth with a clinical attachment loss of >/= 5 mm and probing pocket depth (ppd) of >/= 5 mm.  they were randomly assigned into one of three groups (n = 10): (i) 3 g daily of placebo gel applied topically (using a dental tray with the gel overnight) + periodontal debridement; (ii) 3 g daily of a 15% mtz benzoate gel applied topically (using a dental tray with the gel overnight) + periodontal debridement; and (iii) a daily single dose of 750 mg mtz (flagyl(r) ) + periodontal debridement. clinical parameters (visible plaque index, gingival bleeding index [gbi], relative attachment level and ppd) and quantitative analysis (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 mo after periodontal debridement. results: there was no statistically significant difference in the average gbi and visible plaque index  values at baseline between the groups (p >/= 0.05). there was no significant difference between groups in all parameters evaluated (p >/= 0.05). significant reductions in gbi at 3 and 6 mo were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). significant reductions in both ppd and relative attachment level at 1, 3 and 6 mo were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). significant reductions in bacterial levels at 7 and 30 d were observed in all groups (p < 0.05). conclusion: adjunctive use of mtz (gel or tablet) to periodontal debridement had similar clinical and microbiological improvement compared to treatment with placebo + periodontal debridement in smokers with chronic periodontitis up to 6 mo post-treatment. further studies are necessary to confirm the clinical relevance of these findings.

TI  == bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: aggressive periodontitis (agp) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. in morocco, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been  strongly associated with agp, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in moroccan patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (chp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were  pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised  agp compared to chp, and porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized agp, when compared with generalized agp (p = 0.040) or chp (p = 0.016). prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in agp groups, when compared to chp, and generalized agp patients harbored significantly higher proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, when compared to localized agp or chp. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum were frequently detected in this moroccan population with agp. differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized agp, generalized agp and chp patients.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == a. actinomycetemcomitans profile and red complex bacterial species of an afro-brazilian community: a comparative study.
AB  == purposes: the primary aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non afro-brazilian cohort. the secondary aim was to compare the distribution of both aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b and its jp2 strains among participants who harboured this bacterial species. methods: a total of 84 individuals were included in this study: 42 afro-descendants (mean age 35.9 +/- 13.1 years) and 42 non-afro-descendants (mean age 36.2 +/- 13.1 years) matched (1:1) by periodontal  diagnosis, age and gender. all participants received clinical examinations of periodontal pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and plaque and gingival indices. subgingival samples were taken for microbial analysis. first, genomic dna (gdna) was extracted and purified and the quantification of total number of bacterial cells, a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola was carried out by qpcr. then, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains were classified according to serotype b and jp2 profiles by conventional pcr. results: clinically, mean pd, mean cal and percentage of cal >/= 3 mm differed between groups (student's t-test p<0.05). the levels of red complex bacteria between afro-brazilian and non-afro-brazilian populations were similar. the exception was verified to a. actinomycetemcomitans  showing significantly higher levels among afro-brazilian descendants in comparison to non-afro-brazilian descendants. afro-brazilian descendants were clearly infected by more virulent serotype b and jp2 strains. conclusions: despite no statistically significant differences related to the red complex species, afro-brazilian descendants harboured higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, our findings confirm that afro-descendant populations are preferably colonised by a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b as well as jp2 strains.

TI  == comparison of serum amyloid a protein and c-reactive protein levels as inflammatory markers in periodontitis.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare serum amyloid a (saa) protein levels with high-sensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp) levels as markers of systemic inflammation in patients with chronic periodontitis. the association of  serum titers of antibodies to periodontal microbiota and saa/hs-crp levels in periodontitis patients was also studied. methods: a total of 110 individuals were included in this study. patients were assessed for levels of hs-crp and saa. nonfasting blood samples were collected from participants at the time of clinical examination. the diagnosis of adipose tissue disorders was made according to previously defined criteria. to determine saa levels, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized. paper points were transferred to a sterile tube to obtain a pool of samples for polymerase chain reaction processing and the identification of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and tannerella forsythia. the serum level of igg1 and igg2 antibodies to p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and t. forsythia was also  determined. results: saa and hs-crp levels were higher in periodontitis patients  than in controls (p<0.05). in bivariate analysis, high levels of hs-crp (>3 mg/l) and saa (>10 mg/l) were significantly associated with chronic periodontitis (p=0.004). the spearman correlation analysis between acute-phase proteins showed  that saa positively correlated with hs-crp (r=0.218, p=0.02). in the adjusted model, chronic periodontitis was associated with high levels of saa (odds ratio [or], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-18.2; p=0.005) and elevated hs-crp levels (or, 6.1, 95% ci, 1.6-23.6; p=0.008). increased levels of serum igg2 antibodies to p. gingivalis were associated with high levels of saa (or, 3.6; 95% ci, 1.4-8.5; p=0.005) and high concentrations of hs-crp (or, 4.3; 95% ci, 1.9-9.8; p<0.001). conclusions: saa and hs-crp concentrations in patients with chronic periodontitis are comparably elevated. high serum titers of antibodies to p. gingivalis and the presence of periodontal disease are independently related to high saa and hs-crp levels.

TI  == inter- and intra-test agreement of three commercially available molecular diagnostic tests for the identification of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to compare the agreement and reproducibility  of three test kits (iai pado test 4[symbol: see text]5(r), micro-ident(r), and carpegen(r) perio diagnostik) regarding the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. materials and methods: periodontal plaque samples from 20  patients suffering from severe chronic or aggressive periodontitis were split into two identical batches. samples of batch 1 were evaluated immediately. samples of batch 2 were analyzed after a storage period of 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. results: the conformity of results obtained by the evaluated test kits as well as the concordant detection rate of periodontopathogens proved to be low. the agreement of the detection rate depends on the chosen test kit. the intra-test reproducibility of the qualitative analysis of identical plaque samples was perfect only for carpegen(r) perio diagnostik. the quantitative analysis of the results expressed as n-fold difference of the test results revealed an only poor  inter-test agreement between the test systems. conclusions: results of test kits  for the identification of periodontopathogens are significantly influenced by the detection technology applied. the most advanced technology tended to give the most reliable results. clinical relevance: as microbiological test results are supposed to be used for the planning of subsequent treatment strategies, clinicians should be aware of the limitations of results obtained by the different test systems and should use the results only in conjunction with clinical data for subsequent therapeutic decisions.

TI  == anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB  == background: anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. highlight: studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed  microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter (wolinella) rectus and other campylobacter species, and tannerella (bacteroides) forsythia. anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with  gingivitis, and added selenomonas noxia and filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. porphyromonas gingivalis and t. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. the dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. the major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species. anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. the pcr-based cloning approach, however, underestimated actinobacteria compared with culture. only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low ph acid agar. while the major caries-associated species was s. mutans, a new species, scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. higher counts of s. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. conclusion: in periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of pcr with standard primers that underestimate detection of actinobacteria.

TI  == short-term effect of removal of fixed orthodontic appliances on gingival health and subgingival microbiota: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to assess  and compare the microbiological and clinical parameters of patients wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance, as opposed to 10 days after the bracket had been removed following treatment. materials and methods. in total, 122 patients participated in this study; 61 of the subjects were assessed at baseline (wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance: t1) and 10 days after bracket removal (t2). the other 61 individuals had never worn an orthodontic appliance before and these subjects served as controls (ct). subgingival plaque samples were assessed for bleeding on probing (gbi) and plaque index (vpi). pcr of 16s rdna, followed by reverse species-specific hybridization for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were performed. a descriptive analysis was conducted; chi-squared, student's matched and unmatched t-tests, the point biserial correlation coefficient and the mcnemar test were used to test for differences between groups (p < 0.05). results. the gbi and vpi clinical parameters showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) between t1-t2, t1-ct and t2-ct. the prevalence of t. denticola had significantly decreased (p = 0.039) 10 days after appliance removal. at t2, a significant positive correlation was found between gbi and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.01) and between clinical parameters and p. intermedia. in patients without a fixed orthodontic appliance (t2 and ct), there  was a significant positive correlation between t. forsythia and vpi. conclusion.  local factors associated with the wearing of a fixed orthodontic appliance influence changes in subgingival plaque that leads to more inflammation and bleeding.

TI  == the effect of il-4 gene polymorphisms on cytokine production in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy controls.
AB  == chronic periodontitis (cp) is an inflammatory disease of the teeth-supporting tissues in which genetic predisposition, dental plaque bacteria, and immune mechanisms all play important roles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of il-4 gene polymorphisms in chronic periodontitis and to investigate the association between polymorphisms and cytokines production after bacterial stimulation. sixty-two subjects (47 cp patients and 15 healthy controls) with detected two polymorphisms in the il-4 gene (-590c/t and intron 3 vntr) were examined. production of cytokines (il-1alpha, il-1beta, il-4, il-5, il-6, il-10,  il-17, tnfalpha, infgamma, and vegf) was studied after in vitro stimulation of isolated peripheral blood by mitogens (pokeweed mitogen, concanavalin a), dental  plaque bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia), and heat shock protein (hsp) 70 by the luminex multiplex cytokine analysis system. the results were correlated with il-4 genotypes in patients with cp and healthy controls. the mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of cp patients with selected il-4 polymorphisms significantly altered the production of ifngamma, il-10, il-1beta, il-1alpha, tnfalpha, and il-6 after stimulation by hsp 70 or selected bacteria (from p < 0.001 to p < 0.05). il-4 gene polymorphisms may influence the  function of mononuclear cells to produce not only interleukin-4 but also other cytokines, especially in patients with cp.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

AB  == background: although patients with diabetes are frequently affected by periodontitis, only a few investigations have focused on gingivitis in this at-risk population. this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial compared the response to a gingivitis treatment protocol that combined mechanical procedures and daily use of an essential oil (eo) mouthrinse between patients with and without diabetes. methods: the whole-mouth periodontal probing depth (pd), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi) were monitored in gingivitis cases among systemically healthy patients (n = 60) or those with diabetes (n = 60) at baseline and 3 months after treatment. levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and total bacterial  load were determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction in intrasulci plaque samples. the volume of gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) was quantified, and interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) levels were determined in gcf samples. after a full-mouth ultrasonic debridement, patients were randomly assigned to an eo or a  placebo rinse for 90 days (40 ml/day). the data were analyzed through repeated-measures analysis of variance and multiple comparisons tukey tests (p <0.05). results: gi was more severe in the diabetes group. diabetes impaired gi and reduced gcf volume. pd, bacterial levels, and il-1beta improved similarly in  both systemic conditions. the adjunctive use of eo provided greater reductions of pi, gi, total bacterial load, t. forsythia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and gcf volume. conclusions: response to gingivitis treatment in patients with diabetes can slightly differ from that in patients without diabetes. daily use of an eo mouthrinse after ultrasonic debridement benefited patients with and without diabetes.

TI  == adjunctive moxifloxacin in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis  patients: clinical and microbiological results of a randomized, triple-blind and  placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of moxifloxacin (mox) in one-stage scaling and root planing (srp) in treating generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). materials  and methods: forty subjects were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. the  two treatment groups consisted of srp combined with systemically administered mox at the dosage of 400 mg once daily for 7 days or srp + placebo once daily for 7 days. subgingival plaque samples were analysed for cultivable bacteria. results:  both groups resulted in significant reduction of probing depth (pd) and clinical  attachment level (cal) compared with baseline (p < 0.0001), and this difference was maintained at 6 months from baseline in both groups. however, subjects receiving mox showed the greatest improvements cal, and pd. subjects in both groups at 6 months displayed the greatest reduction from baseline in frequency of sites with pd >/= 6 mm (p < 0.001), favouring the mox group. adjunctive antibiotic protocol reduced subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to  undetectable levels, after 3 and 6 months, and there was a significant reduction  in the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia in the mox group compared to the placebo group. conclusions: the results from this study suggest that moxifloxacin as and adjunct to one-stage full-mouth srp leads to a better clinical and microbiological advantages compared to mechanical treatment.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == antibodies to periodontal pathogens are associated with coronary plaque remodeling but not with vulnerability or burden.
AB  == objective: previous studies have suggested positive associations between periodontal infection and cardiovascular disease. we aimed to investigate the associations of circulating antibodies against periodontal pathogens with 1-year  cardiovascular outcome, as well as the extent of coronary atherosclerosis, plaque vulnerability and lesion remodeling on intravascular ultrasound (ivus) imaging. methods: between 2008 and 2011, radiofrequency ivus imaging of a non-culprit coronary artery was performed in 581 patients who underwent coronary angiography. immunoglobulin g (igg) and a (iga) against porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were measured in plasma. results: none of the antibody levels were associated with coronary plaque burden, radiofreqeuncy-ivus-derived thin-cap fibroatheroma lesion morphology or 1-year incidence of major adverse cardiac events (mace), which included all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome and unplanned coronary revascularization. iga against a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. forsythia and p. intermedia were inversely associated with extent of positive lesion remodeling (or for highest versus lowest tertile 0.55, 95%ci 0.35-0.88, p  = 0.012; 0.53, 95%ci 0.32-0.87, p = 0.012; and 0.64, 95%ci 0.40-1.02, p = 0.061,  respectively). in diabetic patients specifically, igg against p. gingivalis tended to be associated with coronary plaque burden (p = 0.080), while iga against p. gingivalis tended to be associated with incident mace (p = 0.060). conclusion: plasma igg and iga against major periodontal pathogens were not associated with the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (with the exception of a trend in diabetics) nor with coronary plaque vulnerability. iga against periodontal pathogens were inversely associated with extent of coronary remodeling. altogether, these results do not add evidence for a substantial role  of systemic exposure to periodontal pathogens in coronary artery disease.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == igg sera levels against a subset of periodontopathogens and severity of disease in aggressive periodontitis patients: a cross-sectional study of selected pocket  sites.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the association among serum immunoglobulin g (igg) responses to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) serotypes a, b and c, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf) and clinical parameters in aggressive  periodontitis (ap) subjects. associations between periodontal pathogens and clinical and immunological parameters were also evaluated. methods: thirty-eight  subjects diagnosed with generalized ap (gap) and localized ap (lap) were included. ten healthy controls were also evaluated. clinical parameters were assessed and percentages of subgingival levels of aa, pg and tf (beyond bacterial load), were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. serum igg antibody levels against aa, pg and tf were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: percentages of aa, pg and tf were significantly higher in ap than in controls. the response to aa serotype c was higher in lap subjects than in controls. there were no differences in microbial composition or  antibodies responses between gap and lap, except for igg response to tf. pg levels were correlated with probing depth (pd), bop and cal in gap but not in lap subjects. tf levels correlated with pd and cal in gap subjects. in gap, the infection levels of aa and pg correlated with the corresponding igg levels to aa  serotype c and pg. conclusion: given the evidences that igg response in ap patients correlated with bacterial infection level in gap, but not in lap, and that lap patients lack a response to tf, despite harbouring this species, our data suggest a difference in host immune defence between these two forms of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == periodontopathogens and human beta-defensin-2 expression in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontal disease in guangxi, china.
AB  == background and objective: periodontal diseases are often induced by periodontopathogens, which are always exposed to certain innate immune factors in gingival crevicular fluid, including human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2). this study aims to investigate the relationship among periodontopathogens, clinical parameters and hbd-2 expression. material and methods: thirty-two healthy controls, 42 patients with chronic gingivitis and 95 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited in guangxi, china. bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were measured for all teeth including mesiobuccal, buccal, disobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, disolingual six sites of all patient.  gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from the study sites. the prevalence and copy numbers (cn) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia and total bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid were quantified by real-time pcr. the hbd-2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid was measured  by elisa. results: both the prevalence and the cn of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls and patients with chronic gingivitis; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of p. intermedia among the three study groups, and the highest cn was found in patients with chronic gingivitis, rather than in patients with chronic periodontitis. the loads of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. denticola and total bacteria were positively  related to probing depth, bleeding index and clinical attachment level. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in patients with chronic gingivitis and in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls. in addition, the hbd-2 concentration was positively related to the cn of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and total bacteria, as well as to bleeding index and probing depth. conclusion: the prevalence, composition and cn of periodontopathogens were closely related to the severity of periodontal disease,  and the red complex was related to the severity of clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease sites was higher than that in gingival crevicular fluid  from healthy sites, which suggests that hbd-2 expression might be up-regulated by periodontopathogens.

TI  == effect of repeated adjunctive antimicrobial photodynamic therapy on subgingival periodontal pathogens in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effect of subgingival ultrasonic scaling followed by repeated (three times) antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (pdt), ultrasonic scaling alone (us), and scaling and root planing with hand instruments (srp) for initial periodontal treatment. twenty-seven non-smoking systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients were included. residual pockets >/=4 mm deep and bleeding on probing were debrided either with srp, us alone, or us followed by a single episode of pdt during supportive periodontal treatment. probing pocket depth (ppd), bleeding on probing (bop), and clinical attachment level (cal) were monitored over 12 months. the presence of five periodontal pathogens in the pockets was determined by a commercially available micro-ident test. intergroup and intragroup statistical analysis was performed. all three treatments resulted in a significant clinical improvement. additional application of pdt to us failed to result in further improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain. however, it resulted in a higher reduction of bop at 3 and 12 months comparing to us alone or srp (pdt from 25 to 13 and to 9 %, us from 23 to  16 and to 12 %, and srp from 17 to 10 and to 9 %, respectively). pdt reduced the  proportion of positive sites after 6 months for treponema denticola (td) significantly more effectively than us or srp (p < 0.0001). additionally, pdt resulted in a greater reduction of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), and td in medium pockets (4-6 mm) (p < 0.02) and of td in deep pockets (>6 mm) compared to mechanical debridement alone (p < 0.05).

TI  == periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaque.
AB  == background: there has been increasing attention paid in recent years to the possibility that oral bacterial infection, particularly periodontal disease may influence the initiation and or progression of systemic diseases. these studies confirm the observation that heart disease is the most commonly found systemic condition in patients with periodontal disease. moreover, the literature has also highlighted substantial evidence indicating the presence of gram-negative periodontal pathogens in atheromatous plaques. aim: this study intends to investigate the possible association between periodontal health and coronary artery disease by evaluating periodontal status, association between the periodontal plaque and coronary atheromatous plaques for presence of micro-organisms such as, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia. materials and methods: a case-control study was designed with seven patients who had undergone  coronary endarterectomy for cardiovascular disease and 28 controls. the periodontal examination for cases was performed 1 day before vascular surgery and the controls were clinically examined. the atheromatous plaque sample collected during endarterectomy and the intraoral plaque samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction for identification of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia. results: the presence of periodontal  bacteria dna in coronary atheromatous plaques and sub-gingival plaque samples of  the same patients was confirmed by this study. conclusion a correlation was established between putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques and species associated with periodontal disease. one particularly important study to  be carried out is the investigation of a possible clinically meaningful reduction in coronary heart disease resulting from the prevention or treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background and objective: human beta-defensins (hbds) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. the aim of this  study was to explore relationships among hbds, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: the periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. the relative expression of hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time pcr. the numbers of total bacteria and of treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time pcr. data were analyzed using the mann-whitney u-test and spearman's rank correlation test. results: no significant differences in expression of the hbd genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and  the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. total bacteria and t. denticola were detected in all participants. f. nucleatum and t. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. the prevalence of all bacteria, except a. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group  of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). a significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hbd-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hbd-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. conclusion: the negative correlations between hbd-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hbds may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.

TI  == genetic characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == periodontal disease is caused by a group of bacteria that utilize a variety of strategies and molecular mechanisms to evade or overcome host defenses. recent research has uncovered new evidence illuminating interesting aspects of the virulence of these bacteria and their genomic variability. this paper summarizes  some of the strategies utilized by the major species - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis - implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. whole-genome sequencing of 14 diverse a. actinomycetemcomitans strains has revealed variations in their genetic content (ranging between 0.4% and 19.5%) and organization. strikingly, isolates from human periodontal sites showed no genomic changes during persistent colonization. t. forsythia manipulates the cytokine responses of macrophages and monocytes through its surface glycosylation. studies have revealed that bacterial surface-expressed o-linked glycans modulate t-cell responses during periodontal inflammation. periodontal pathogens belonging to the "red complex" consortium express neuraminidases, which enables them to scavenge sialic acid from host glycoconjugates. analysis of recent data has demonstrated that the cleaved sialic acid acts as an important nutrient for bacterial growth and a molecule for the decoration of bacteria surfaces to help evade the host immune attack. in addition, bacterial entry into host cells is also an important  prerequisite for the lifestyle of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis. studies have shown that, after its entry into the cell, this bacterium uses multiple sorting pathways destined for autophagy, lysosomes, or recycling pathways. in addition, p. gingivalis releases outer membrane vesicles which enter cells via endocytosis and cause cellular functional impairment.

TI  == assessment of periodontal and opportunistic flora in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 37. susceptibility to periodontal diseases].
AB  == in the eighties of the former century it was observed that individuals had different modes of development of periodontitis, largely for unknown reasons. it  was assumed that periodontal disease developed as a result of the presence of virulent micro-organisms in combination with an inadequate host response. the concept of this (im)balance in host parasite interactions developed further, in part because of new research techniques. with respect to oral bacteria it was shown that periodontal pathogens like aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are risk factors for periodontitis. furthermore, genetic polymorphisms (snp's) have been shown to modulate the host response against the periopathogens. medical and lifestyle factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, smoking, psychological stress and, to a minor extent, also hormonal changes can have an impact on the progression of periodontitis. all this information contributes to determining the individual risk profile of a patient for developing periodontitis and for estimating the prognosis of periodontal treatment and maintenance care on an individual basis.

TI  == subgingival plaque sampling after combined mechanical and antibiotic nonsurgical  periodontal therapy.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to make a comparison of two sampling strategies of subgingival plaque after combined mechanical-antibiotic periodontal therapy. methods: thirty patients (18 female) suffering from aggressive (n = 12) or generalised severe chronic (n = 18) periodontitis were included. aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans had been detected subgingivally in all prior to anti-infective therapy (at) and combined mechanical-antibiotic at had been rendered. after at clinical examinations were performed and subgingival plaque was sampled from the same four sites as prior to at (aspre) as well as from the four deepest sites after at (deep). per patient two pooled samples (aspre/deep) were generated and analysed for a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola using a commercial 16s rrna test. results: aspre failed to detect a. actinomycetemcomitans, deep detected a. actinomycetemcomitans only in two patients (7 %). only for t. forsythia deep (53 %) provided higher detection frequencies than aspre (27 %; p = 0.005). detection frequencies of p. gingivalis and t. denticola ranged from 47 to 53 %. conclusion: after combined mechanical-antibiotic at sampling the deepest sites revealed higher detection rates. combined mechanical-antibiotic at suppresses a. actinomycetemcomitans to a higher extent than p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples from patients with peripheral arterial disease or abdominal aortic aneurysms.
AB  == background: the aim of this investigation is to quantify periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, and tannerella forsythia) in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples. as a secondary objective, two molecular bacterial identification methods (nested polymerase chain reaction [pcr] and quantitative pcr [qpcr]) are compared. methods: seventy consecutive patients provided a vascular lesion, a blood sample, and 36 subgingival samples. bacterial dna was extracted, and qpcr was used to determine the prevalence and amounts of the target pathogens in each sample. nested pcr was performed only in the samples from vascular lesions. periodontal examination was performed in 42 patients. mann-whitney u or chi(2) tests were used to compare microbiologic results according to periodontal diagnosis. results: all targeted periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, or c. rectus) were detected in subgingival samples, with a prevalence rate of 72.2%, 47.2%, 74.3%, and 82.9%, respectively. in 7.1% and 11.4% of vascular and blood samples, bacterial dna was detected. one patient  was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans in the three types of samples. no differences were found in the levels of targeted bacteria when comparing patients with and without periodontitis. prevalence rates obtained with nested pcr were significantly higher than those obtained with qpcr. conclusions: the presence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans was demonstrated in vascular, blood, and subgingival samples in one of 36 patients. these results, although with a very low frequency, may support the hypothesis of a translocation of periodontal pathogens from subgingival microbiota to the bloodstream and then to atheromatous plaques in carotid or other peripheral arteries. nested pcr is not an adequate method for identifying dna of periodontal pathogens in low quantities because of the high number of false-negative results.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == in vitro-activity of oily calcium hydroxide suspension on microorganisms as well  as on human alveolar osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  == background: findings from animal and human studies have indicated that an oily calcium hydroxide suspension (ochs) may improve early wound healing in the treatment of periodontitis. calcium hydroxide as the main component is well known for its antimicrobial activity, however at present the effect of ochs on the influence of periodontal wound healing/regeneration is still very limited. the purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of ochs on periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as on the attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. methods: human alveolar osteoblasts (hao) and periodontal ligament (pdl) fibroblasts were cultured on 3 concentrations of ochs (2.5, 5 and 7.5 mg). adhesion and proliferation were counted up to 48 h and mineralization was assayed after 1 and 2 weeks. furthermore potential growth inhibitory activity on microorganisms associated with periodontal disease (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) as well as the influence of periodontopathogens and ochs on the hao and pdl fibroblasts counts were determined. results: more than a 2-fold increase in adherent hao cells was observed at 4 h following application of ochs when compared to the control group  (p = 0.007 for 2.5 mg). proliferation of hao cells at 48 h was stimulated by moderate concentrations (2.5 mg; 5 mg) of ochs (each p < 0.001), whereas a high concentration (7.5 mg) of ochs was inhibitory (p = 0.009). mineralization was observed only for hao cells treated with ochs. ochs did not exert any positive effect on attachment or proliferation of pdl fibroblasts. although ochs did not have an antibacterial effect, it did positively influence attachment and proliferation of hao cells and pdl fibroblasts in the presence of periodontopathogens. conclusions: the present data suggests that ochs promotes osteoblast attachment, proliferation and mineralization in a concentration-dependent manner and results are maintained in the presence of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == biology and pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus in periodontal disease.
AB  == human periodontitis is associated with a wide range of bacteria and viruses and with complex innate and adaptive immune responses. porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses are major suspected pathogens of periodontitis, and a combined herpesvirus-bacterial periodontal infection can potentially explain major clinical features of the disease. cytomegalovirus infects periodontal macrophages and t-cells and elicits a release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. these proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the host defense against the virus, but they  also have the potential to induce alveolar bone resorption and loss of periodontal ligament. gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus also exhibit diminished collagen production and release of an increased level of matrix metalloproteinases. this article reviews innate and adaptive immunity to cytomegalovirus and suggests that immune responses towards cytomegalovirus can play roles in controlling, as well as in exacerbating, destructive periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == molecular microbiological evaluation of subgingival biofilm sampling by paper point and curette.
AB  == the present clinical study aimed to investigate if there are differences in microbiological outcomes dependent on the subgingival biofilm collection method.  subgingival biofilm samples were collected from the four deepest pockets (>5 mm)  of 17 patients with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and 33 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), first by paper point and thereafter by curette. samples obtained with the same method were pooled together from each patient and forwarded for molecular microbiological analysis by a commercially available assay (iai pado test 4.5) that estimates total bacterial load and levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. data analysis included frequency of detection, quantification and correlation of detection levels between the two sampling methods. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola were detected in >90% of the samples, and their detection levels exhibited a strong correlation between sampling methods. the detection consistency of a. actinomycetemcomitans was 56% between the two sampling methods. a. actinomycetemcomitans was more readily detected by paper point compared with curette collection with a stronger  correlation between the two methods in agp. subgingival biofilm sampling by curette or paper point does not yield differences in the detection of the three 'red complex' species. however, a. actinomycetemcomitans was more consistently detected by means of paper point collection, which can be crucial in the decision to administer antibiotics as an adjunctive periodontal treatment.

TI  == quantification of key periodontal pathogens in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic  and non-diabetic patients with generalized chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis is a common problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (dm), however, differences in the putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with dm compared to non-dm subjects are still inconclusive. the red complex, which includes porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, encompasses the most important pathogens in adult periodontal disease. the aim of the present study was to compare cell numbers of p. gingivalis, t. denticola, t.  forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in gingival sulcus of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis sites of non-diabetes mellitus (ndm), controlled and poorly controlled insulin-dependent dm (cdm and pdm) patients with generalized chronic periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were collected from 19 cdm, 19 pdm and 19 ndm patients. taqman real time-pcr was used to determine bacterial cell number. at subject level, the quantity of red complex bacteria was significantly higher in pdm than those of ndm and positively correlated with hba1c. at site level (total 342 sites), cell numbers of t. denticola and t. forsythia in healthy sites of cdm and pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm. in gingivitis sites, the numbers of p. gingivalis in cdm and pdm and t. forsythia in pdm were significantly higher than those of ndm while in periodontitis sites, higher quantity of p. gingivalis in pdm was observed. our study indicated that poor glycemic control is associated with increasing cell numbers of red complex bacteria in subgingival biofilm.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue  (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus  in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence  underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials,  antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI  == association between periodontal disease and plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.
AB  == objective: untreated periodontal disease seems to cause low grade systemic inflammation and blood lipid alteration leading to increased cardiovascular disease risk. to start testing this hypothesis in colombian patients, a multicentre study was conducted including the three main state capitals: bogota,  medellin and cali. methods: in this study 192 (28.4%) advanced and 256 (37.8%) moderate periodontitis patients were investigated for socio-demographic variables, city of precedence, periodontal parameters, smoking, red complex periodontopathic bacteria, serum antibodies against porphyromonas gingivalis and  aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and blood lipids including total cholesterol, hdl, ldl and triglycerides (tg). those parameters were compared to 229 (33.8%) controls having periodontal health or gingivitis. results: advanced periodontitis had worst periodontal indexes, than moderate periodontitis and controls. interestingly, higher hdl and tg levels were present in periodontitis.  bmi <30 and smoking were associated with increased hdl, hdl-35, ldl and tg, while glycemia >100 mg/dl associated with hdl, hdl-35 and tg. tannerella forsythia showed a significant association with hdl-35 in bivariate analysis and serum igg1 against p. gingivalis associated with hdl-35 and serum igg1 against t. forsythia  associated with tg and serum igg2 against a. actinomycetemcomitans correlated with levels of hdl y hdl-35. in logistic regression the periodontitis patients from cali presented reduced hdl levels as compared to bogota and medellin patients. presence of igg1 antibodies against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans correlated with reduced hdl levels. conclusion: this study  confirmed that untreated periodontitis generates alteration in serum lipid levels and systemic bacterial exposure against important periodontopathic bacteria could be the biological link.

TI  == subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans associates with the risk of coronary artery disease.
AB  == aim: we investigated the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. materials and methods: the cross-sectional study population (n = 445) comprised 171 (38.4%) patients with stable cad, 158 (35.5%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs) and 116  (26.1%) with no significant cad (no cad). all patients participated in clinical and radiological oral health examinations. pooled subgingival bacterial samples were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assays. results: in all study groups, the presence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola indicated a  significant (p </= 0.001) linear association with the extent of alveolar bone loss (abl), but a. actinomycetemcomitans did not (p = 0.074). with a threshold level of bacterial cells 1 x 10(5) a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent in the stable cad group (42.1%) compared to the no cad group (30.2%) (p = 0.040). in a multi-adjusted logistic regression analysis using this  threshold, a. actinomycetemcomitans positivity associated with stable cad (or 1.83, 95% ci 1.00-3.35, p = 0.049), but its level or levels of other bacteria did not. conclusions: the presence of subgingival a. actinomycetemcomitans associates with an almost twofold risk of stable cad independently of alveolar bone loss.

TI  == influence of periodontal status and periodontopathogens on levels of oral human beta-defensin-2 in saliva.
AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

TI  == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI  == possible translocation of periodontal pathogens into the lymph nodes draining the oral cavity.
AB  == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were  no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it  appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == modeling susceptibility to periodontitis.
AB  == chronic inflammatory diseases like periodontitis have a complex pathogenesis and  a multifactorial etiology, involving complex interactions between multiple genetic loci and infectious agents. we aimed to investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms and bacteria on chronic periodontitis risk. we determined the prevalence of 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in immune response candidate genes and 7 bacterial species of potential relevance to periodontitis etiology, in chronic periodontitis patients and non-periodontitis control individuals (n = 385). using decision tree analysis, we identified the presence of bacterial species tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and snps tnf -857 and il-1a -889 as discriminators between periodontitis and non-periodontitis. the model reached an  accuracy of 80%, sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 73%, and auc of 73%. this pilot study shows that, on the basis of 3 periodontal pathogens and snps, patterns may be recognized to identify patients at risk for periodontitis. modern bioinformatics tools are valuable in modeling the multifactorial and complex nature of periodontitis.

TI  == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB  == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of  this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in  quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == periodontal pathogen load and increased antibody response to heat shock protein 60 in patients with cardiovascular disease.
AB  == aim: to determine the relationship between periodontal pathogen load and anti-human heat shock protein 60 (hhsp60) antibodies in patients with established cardiovascular disease (cvd). materials and methods: participants were cardiovascular patients (n = 74) with a previous hospital admission for myocardial infarction. concurrent periodontal pathogen load of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was determined using quantitative real-time pcr. serum antibodies to these pathogens, groel and hhsp60 were determined using an elisa. results: there was a trend for increasing anti-hhsp60 antibody as the number of bacterial species increased. the strongest positive correlations were found between anti-hhsp60 levels and numbers of t. forsythia (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and  between anti-hhsp60 and anti-groel levels (r = 0.39; p = 0.001). patients with extensive periodontal pocketing (>/=4 mm) had higher numbers of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (p < 0.05) and a higher subgingival pathogen load (p < 0.05) than patients with minimal pocketing (</=1 site >/= 4 mm). they also had significantly elevated anti-hhsp60 levels (p < 0.05). overall, the highest anti-hhsp60 levels were seen in patients with extensive periodontal pocketing and all four bacterial species. conclusions: in cardiovascular patients, a greater burden of subgingival infection with increased levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia is associated with modestly higher anti-hhsp60 levels.

TI  == clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with self-ligating and conventional brackets during early phase of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of different bracket designs (conventional brackets and self-ligating brackets) on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. material and methods: the following  inclusion criteria were used: requirement of orthodontic treatment plan starting  with alignment and leveling, good general health, healthy periodontium, no antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months before the beginning of the study, and no smoking. the study sample totaled 38 patients (13 male, 25 female; mean age, 14.6 +/- 2.0 years). patients were divided into two groups with random distribution of brackets. recording of clinical parameters was done before the placement of the orthodontic appliance (t0) and at 6 weeks (t1), 12 weeks (t2), and 18 weeks (t3) after full bonding of orthodontic appliances. periodontal pathogens of subgingival microflora were detected at t3 using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test (micro-dent test) that contains probes for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. results: there was a statistically significant higher prevalence of a actinomycetemcomitans in patients with conventional brackets than in patients with self-ligating brackets, but there was no statistically significant difference for other putative periodontal pathogens. the two different types of brackets did not show statistically significant differences in periodontal clinical parameters. conclusion: bracket design does not seem to have a strong influence on periodontal clinical parameters and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque.  the correlation between some periodontal pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters was weak.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens among patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the periodontal pathogens that form the red complex (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in  patients with chronic periodontitis. the sample consisted of 29 patients with a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of chronic periodontitis based on the criteria of the american academy of periodontology (3). samples for microbiological analysis were collected from the four sites of greatest probing depth in each patient, totaling 116 samples. these samples were processed using conventional polymerase chain reaction, which achieved the following positive results: 46.6% for p. gingivalis, 41.4% for t. forsythia, 33.6% for t. denticola  and 27.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more  prevalent (p < 0.05) in periodontal pockets >/= 8 mm. the combinations t. forsythia + p. gingivalis (23.2%) and t. forsythia + p. gingivalis + t. denticola (20.0%) were more frequent in sites with a probing depth >/= 8 mm. associations with the simultaneous presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans + p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans + t. forsythia, p. gingivalis + t. forsythia and t. forsythia + t. denticola were statistically significant (p < 0.05). it was concluded that the red complex pathogens are related to chronic periodontitis, presenting a higher occurrence in deep periodontal pockets. moreover, the simultaneous presence of these bacteria in deep sites suggests a symbiotic relationship between these virulent species, favoring, in this way, a further progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == a common periodontal pathogen has an adverse association with both acute and stable coronary artery disease.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the association between angiographically verified coronary artery disease (cad) and salivary levels of four major periodontal pathogens. methods: the study population (n = 492) was composed of 179 (36.4%) patients with stable cad, 166 (33.7%) with acute coronary syndrome (acs), and 119 (24.2%) showing no pathological findings by coronary angiography. all patients were subjected to a detailed oral health examination. the saliva samples were analyzed for lipopolysaccharide activity as well as for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia by quantitative pcr. serum antibodies levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans were analyzed. results: the level of bacterial burden was linearly associated with alveolar bone loss (p < 0.001) and bleeding on probing (p = 0.015). the median salivary levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans in pathogen-positive patients were significantly higher in the "stable cad" (p = 0.014) and the "acs" (p = 0.044) groups when compared to "no significant cad" patients. in logistic regression models, a 10-fold increase in the salivary a. actinomycetemcomitans levels was associated with a risk for stable cad and acs with odds ratios (ors) of 7.47 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.57-35.5, p = 0.012) and 4.31 (95% ci: 1.06-17.5, p = 0.041), respectively. the or for the association of iga-class antibody levels against a. actinomycetemcomitans with acs risk was 3.13 (95% ci: 1.38-7.12, p = 0.006)/log(10) unit increase. conclusions: high salivary levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and systemic exposure to the bacterium were associated with increased risk for cad. these findings emphasize the importance of oral microbiota in cardiovascular risk assessment and therapeutics.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == effects of systemic sitafloxacin on periodontal infection control in elderly patients.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the microbiological and clinical effects of the systemic administration of sitafloxacin (stfx) on periodontal pockets in elderly patients  receiving supportive periodontal therapy (spt). background: periodontitis is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. better periodontal health contributes to reduce  atherosclerosis-related diseases in elderly population. materials and methods: forty-four patients undergoing spt were randomly assigned to two groups: a test group took 100 mg/day of stfx for five consecutive days, or a control group received scaling and root planing (srp) under local anaesthesia. microbiological  and clinical parameters were examined at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after therapy. results: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia was significantly reduced at 1 month after treatment in  both groups. the median reductions of the bacteria between the baseline and 1 month were 3.08 and 2.54% in the stfx- and srp-treated groups, respectively. both treatments significantly decreased the probing depth at 1 and 3 months compared to the baseline. conclusion: the systemic administration of stfx is effective at  improving periodontal health during spt and could be an alternative to srp for elderly patients who cannot undergo anaesthesia or are at risk of tissue injury.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles as diagnostic markers of destructive periodontal diseases: a clinical epidemiology study.
AB  == aims: to describe the subgingival microbial profiles of the major putative periodontal pathogens and investigate their role as diagnostic markers for destructive periodontal diseases in an untreated and isolated population. materials and methods: the source population consisted of all subjects aged >/= 12 years in an isolated brazilian population. an interview and a full-mouth clinical examination were conducted and subgingival plaque samples were obtained  from four sites per subject. pcr analyses were used to identify the following micro-organisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. results: among the 214 clinically examined subjects (81% response), 170 of the 195 dentate subjects provided plaque samples. two subgingival microbial profiles were identified: absence of all micro-organisms but campylobacter rectus or co-occurrence of tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis. using a combination of microbiological and interview information, the smallest overall misclassification in the diagnosis of extensive clinical attachment loss >/= 5 mm was 8.8% (4.7% of non-cases and 22% of cases), but this was not different from the 7.6% (2.3% non-cases and 24.4% cases) obtained using clinical and interview information (p = 0.292). conclusion: specific microbial profiles could be identified in this isolated population. they did not result in significant superior diagnostic accuracy when compared to traditional clinical markers.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == microbial profiles of patients seeking treatment for periodontitis. influence of  origin, smoking and age?
AB  == purpose: we assessed the potential influence of the origin, the smoking status and the age on subgingival microbial profiles of subjects seeking periodontal care in switzerland today. material and methods: subgingival samples were obtained from 182 subjects originating from 44 countries (56 native swiss, 64 other european, 43 african, 19 others), seeking periodontal treatment at the school of dental medicine at the university of geneva. four periodontal microorganisms were quantified by direct hybridization with specific rna probes.  results: tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were ubiquitous (95.6%, 93.9%), and porphyromonas gingivalis was frequently detected (89%). counts correlated with the size of the microbial sample (total load). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only 70 (38.4%) subjects. counts were highly variable and unrelated to total load. subjects less than 46.8 years old (median age) had a higher risk to be positive than older subjects. detection frequencies and counts of all four organisms were unrelated to the origin or the  smoking status. conclusions: based on a clinical diagnosis of untreated periodontitis, positive outcomes of tests for t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. gingivalis could be predicted with high confidence irrespective of a patient;'s origin, smoking status or age. detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans was less frequent and depended on the age of the subject.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of one-stage, full-mouth, ultrasonic debridement in aggressive periodontitis treatment.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study is to assess clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic benefits of amoxicillin/metronidazole (am) when performing full-mouth ultrasonic debridement (fmud) in generalized aggressive periodontitis  (gagp) treatment. methods: twenty-four gagp patients were divided into two groups: the fmud group (n = 12), which received fmud plus placebo, and the fmud+am group (n = 12), which received fmud and 375 mg amoxicillin plus 250 mg metronidazole for 7 days. the following clinical outcomes were tested: plaque and bleeding on probing indices, pocket probing depth (pd), relative gingival margin  position (gmp), and relative clinical attachment level (cal). total amount of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentration of interleukin (il)-10 and il-1beta were also determined. all clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters were assessed at baseline and at 3 and  6 months post-therapy. the anova/tukey test was used for statistical analysis (alpha = 5%). results: amoxicillin/metronidazole used as an adjunct to the fmud protocol added clinical and microbiologic benefits to gagp treatment (p <0.05). fmud+am groups presented an additional pd reduction in initially deep pds at the  3-month follow-up (3.99 +/- 1.16 mm and 3.09 +/- 0.78 mm for fmud+am and fmud, respectively; p <0.05), a lower number of residual pockets at the 3- and 6-month  follow-ups, and a statistical reduction in amounts of aa (p <0.05). analysis of tf and pg amounts, as well as il-10 and il-1beta gcf concentrations failed to demonstrate a difference between the groups (p >0.05). conclusion: it may be concluded that amoxicillin/metronidazole improves clinical and microbiologic results of fmud in gagp treatment.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == periodontal pathogens affect the level of protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == in periodontitis, an effective host-response is primarily related to neutrophils  loaded with serine proteases, including elastase (ne) and protease 3 (pr3), the extracellular activity of which is tightly controlled by endogenous inhibitors. in vitro these inhibitors are degraded by gingipains, cysteine proteases produced by porphyromonas gingivalis. the purpose of this study was to determine the level of selected protease inhibitors in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in relation to periodontal infection. the gcf collected from 31 subjects (nine healthy controls, seven with gingivitis, five with aggressive periodontitis and 10 with chronic periodontitis) was analyzed for the levels of elafin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), two main tissue-derived inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases. in parallel, activity of ne, pr3 and arginine-specific gingipains (rgps) in gcf was measured. finally loads of p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were determined. the highest values of elafin were found in aggressive  periodontitis and the lowest in controls. the quantity of elafin correlated positively with the load of p. gingivalis, ta. forsythia and tr. denticola, as well as with rgps activity. in addition, ne activity was positively associated with the counts of those bacterial species, but not with the amount of elafin. in contrast, the highest concentrations of slpi were found in periodontally healthy  subjects whereas amounts of this inhibitor were significantly decreased in patients infected with p. gingivalis. periodontopathogenic bacteria stimulate the release of ne and pr3, which activities escape the control through degradation of locally produced inhibitors (slpi and elafin) by host-derived and bacteria-derived proteases.

TI  == full-mouth disinfection and systemic antimicrobial therapy in generalized aggressive periodontitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: the present investigation aimed to analyse clinical and microbiological effects of systemic administration of metronidazole and amoxicillin combined with the one-stage-full-mouth-disinfection protocol (osfmd) in generalized aggressive  periodontitis patients (g-agp). materials and methods: thirty-nine systemically healthy patients with g-agp were consecutively included. the test group (n = 19)  received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination (500 mg of each, three times a day for 7 days) and the osfmd, the control group (n = 20) received the osfmd and a placebo. in addition to clinical parameters subgingival plaque samples from moderate (4-5 mm) and deep (>/= 6 mm) pocket sites were analysed for the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola using polymerase chain  reaction. results: both therapies led to a statistically significant decrease in  clinical and microbiological parameters compared to baseline (p < 0.001). the most beneficial changes were observed in the test group which showed significantly greater improvements in probing depth and clinical attachment level and a lower prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia compared to the control one (p < 0.05). conclusions: systemic administration of metronidazole and amoxicillin as an adjunct to osfmd therapy significantly improved clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients with g-agp over a 6-month period.

TI  == evidence for graft colonization with periodontal pathogens in lung transplant recipients. a pilot study.
AB  == bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (bos) is a major cause of late graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. there is increasing evidence that beside alloimmunologic injury also non-alloimmunologic inflammatory conditions may raise the risk of acute and chronic rejection. the oral cavity represents a possible reservoir for pathogenic bacteria due to its close anatomical proximity. in this pilot study, the presence of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in the oral  cavity as well as in the lungs of lung transplant recipients was investigated for the first time. eight lung transplant recipients underwent broncho-alveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsies, and endobronchial biopsies. in addition to routinely performed examinations, pulmonary as well as plaque samples were assessed for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and treponema denticola (td) with the aid of a hybridization technique. no or only one periodontal pathogen (solitarily pg) was found in the gingival plaques of five of the eight patients (group a). in three patients, two or more periodontal pathogens were detetectable in the gingival samples (group b). whereas group a also had not more than one periodontal pathogen in the lungs, group b had more than one species in the lungs. in group b, all patients suffered from bos, whereas in group a only one patient was affected. this is the first evidence for the presence of periodontal  pathogens in the lungs of lung transplant recipients. further studies with larger cohorts are required to elucidate potential links between periodontal infection,  pulmonary colonization, and rejection.

TI  == trefoil factors in saliva and gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: trefoil factors (tffs) are secreted molecules that are involved in cytoprotection against tissue damage and the immune response. tffs have been detected in saliva and oral tissues, but their clinical significance has never been investigated in patients with chronic periodontitis. the objective of this study is to determine whether tff expression in saliva and gingival tissues is associated with periodontal pathology. methods: saliva and gingival tissue samples were collected from 25 non-periodontitis individuals and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate the expression of tffs (tff1, tff2, and tff3) in saliva and gingival tissues, respectively. periodontopathic bacteria were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: reduced salivary tff1 and tff3 concentrations were observed in patients with cp (p = 0.003 and p <0.001, respectively). decreased tff3 expression in gingival tissues  of patients with cp was demonstrated (p = 0.041). levels of salivary tff3 concentrations were negatively correlated with periodontal pathology and number of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (formerly known as bacteroides forsythus). conclusions: altered expression of tffs in saliva and gingival tissues was detected in patients with cp. the results suggest that tff3  may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

TI  == the subgingival microbiota of papillon-lefevre syndrome.
AB  == background: there is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. this comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with pls used 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) clonal analysis and the 16s rrna-based human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: thirteen patients with pls from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic dna was extracted. the 16s rrna genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the homim. results: the most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lachnospiraceae ot 100 (ei074), parvimonas micra, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. as a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. in the homim analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with pls. of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. the high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., capnocytophaga granulosa, g. morbillorum, p. micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, streptococcus spp., and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the subgingival microbiota in pls is diverse.  periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development  of severe periodontitis in patients with pls.

TI  == associations of periodontal microorganisms with salivary proteins and mmp-8 in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objective: we investigated in subjects with and without periodontitis, the levels of certain salivary proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-8 (mmp-8) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), in relation to the presence of specific periodontal pathogens. methods: clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, in 1985 and in 2009 from 99 subjects; 56 with and 43 without periodontitis (mean age 59.2 +/- sd 2.9). saliva samples collected in 2009 were analysed for salivary albumin, total  protein and immunoglobulins a, g and m. gcf was collected for analysis of mmp-8 levels and for the pcr-analysis of the microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. results: periodontitis patients were more often infected by p. gingivalis (p < 0.05), p. intermedia and t. denticola (p = 0.01) than controls. salivary albumin and protein concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with t. denticola (p < 0.05). mmp-8 levels were  significantly higher in subjects with t. denticola (p < 0.001) and t. forsythia (p < 0.01). no corresponding results were found in salivary immunoglobulin concentrations. conclusion: the presence of t. denticola seemed to increase salivary albumin and total protein concentrations, and gcf levels of mmp-8. both  t. denticola and t. forsythia seemed to induce a cascade of host response with increased mmp-8 in gcf.

TI  == the effect of spiramycin on porphyromonas gingivalis and other "classic" periopathogens.
AB  == in clinical trials, spiramycin has shown additional benefit overscaling and root  planing on pocket depth reduction, but its effect on periodontal microbiota was evaluated only by darkfield microscopy. therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effect of spiramycin administration on porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria using 16s rarn pcr technique. thirty two non-smoker adults with untreated periodontitis and pocket depth > or = 7 mm. were evaluated to participate in this randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. clinical measurements were performed on day -15, 15, 30 and 90 from baseline. subgingival samples were analyzed for detection of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tj), treponema denticola (td) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) on days -15, 30 and 90. on day 0, 25 pg positive subjects were randomly assigned to receive either systemically administered spiramycinfor 7 days (test group sp) or identical placebo tablets (placebo group  pl). after spiramycin administration pg, tf and td were suppressed showingstatistically significant difference (p<0.05) with the placebo group. none of the groups showed changes in aa detection. these data indicate that bacteria currently associated with advanced periodontitis (pg, tf and td) are suppressed after 7 days of systemic administration of spiramycin.

TI  == salivary levels of antibacterial peptide (ll-37/hcap-18) and cotinine in patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between salivary ll-37 levels and clinical severity in patients with chronic periodontitis (cp). the presence/absence of four periodontopathic bacteria and salivary cotinine levels were also examined to assess the impact of these factors on ll-37 production. methods: unstimulated salivary samples were collected from 69 patients with cp. salivary concentrations of ll-37 and cotinine were measured  by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in saliva were detected by polymerase chain reaction. periodontal examination included determination of probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, and plaque control record. results: mean salivary ll-37 concentration was 225.0 +/- 227.2 ng/ml, and a high prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was observed. the stepwise ordinal logistic regression model showed that high salivary ll-37 levels were significantly associated with the presence of t. denticola and higher percentage of teeth with pd >/=5 mm. in addition, higher salivary cotinine levels (>/=8 ng/ml) were negatively associated with salivary ll-37 levels. conclusions: salivary ll-37 level was positively correlated with severe periodontal destruction, and production was apparently associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. the negative correlations between salivary  ll-37 and cotinine levels also suggest that smoking or long-term exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can lead to lower ll-37 levels in the oral cavity and increased risk of periodontitis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == detection of periodontal markers in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim was to compare the detection frequency of periodontopathogens by using the pado test 4.5 and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique in chronic periodontitis patients.thirty patients with chronic periodontitis were tested cross-sectionally with dna/rna oligogenomic probe method (iai pado test 4.5) and  dna/dna whole genomic probe (checkerboard) method. samples were taken by two paper points at the deepest site in each of the four quadrants and pooled into one sample for each of the two methods. the samples were sent to the two laboratories (iai, zuchwil, switzerland, and oral microbiology laboratory, university of gothenburg, sweden) and were analyzed in a routine setting for the  presence and amount of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola.while pado test 4.5 detected the four periodontal pathogens in 11 (36.7%) of the patients, the checkerboard method showed presence in all patients (100%) using the lower score  (score 1 corresponding to 10(4) bacterial cells) and 16 (53.3%) using a higher treshold (score 3 corresponding to between >10(5) and 10(6) cells).the results of the present study showed low agreement for a positive microbiological outcome using the two diagnostic methods. it was also concluded that microbiological analysis in practice should include a larger number of bacterial species to better serve as markers for a diseased associated flora in chronic periodontitis  cases.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic and immunologic factors related to orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement (ge). methods: our study included 12 patients with ge undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and 12 periodontally healthy controls. at baseline, periodontal variables, subgingival plaque samples, and gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) samples were taken from 2 preselected sites in both the ge and the control  groups. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (invitrogen, camarillo, calif). periodontal therapy was given to the ge group, and all parameters were reassessed after 4 weeks. results: at baseline, the ge group showed higher prevalences of the 5 periodontal pathogens than did the control group (p <0.05). il-1beta and tgf-beta1 levels at the ge sites were also significantly higher than those at the control sites (p <0.05). four weeks after periodontal therapy, the ge group showed significant improvements in the clinical parameters associated with significant reductions of p gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, and t denticola. the levels of il-1beta decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p <0.05), whereas there was no significant change in tgf-beta1 levels (p >0.05). conclusions: periodontal pathogens might have a relationship with the initiation  and development of orthodontic treatment-induced ge. inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tgf-beta1) can also be considered as contributing factors.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus contamination affects transplanted bone volume in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: bone microbial contamination can impair osteogenesis. human herpesviruses-associated vasculitis can cause vascular damage within the osseous  graft and host. this study is conducted to substantiate specific contamination and assess the impact 6 months after sinus augmentation. methods: culture- and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were done on harvested bone  particles and unstimulated whole saliva in a group of 30 patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without a history of periodontitis. radiographic evaluation was done to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and 6 months post-transplantation. results: seventeen patients had a history of periodontitis, and 13 did not. ten showed culture- and pcr-negative results and belonged to the  periodontally healthy group. the 17 patients with periodontitis showed culture- or pcr-positive results for the targeted periodontal pathogens. patients with periodontitis were 2.3 times more likely to have positive salivary epstein-barr virus type 1 (ebv-1) than those with no history of periodontitis. the likelihood  of having moderate to pronounced bone volume loss 6 months postaugmentation was 7.5 times greater in those patients presenting contamination with >/=3 specific pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, or prevotella intermedia) versus those with only one (p <0.05). the odds ratio (or) of pronounced volume loss was 16.3 times higher in those contaminated with a combination of salivary ebv-1 and >/=3 of the previously mentioned species versus only ebv-1 (p <0.05). individuals showing positive salivary ebv-1 had bone bacterial contamination associated 57% of the time. the or of having bone microbial contamination in patients with a history of periodontitis was 37.5 times higher than in individuals without periodontitis. conclusions: this study confirms contamination of bone, harvested intraorally, with key periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing sinus augmentation. specific microbial contamination can impair osteogenesis. saliva may act as a vehicle to transport ebv and other pathogens into the sinus. increased bone volume loss seems to be associated with the occurrence of specific periodontal anaerobic species, salivary ebv-1, or the combination of both.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of adjunctive use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse in untreated gingivitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (chx) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in patients with untreated gingivitis. fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to  chx or placebo groups. chx group rinsed with 0.2% chx, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. subgingival plaque samples were collected and plaque index (pi), papilla bleeding index (pbi), calculus index, and probing  pocket depth (ppd) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. the amounts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria were detected by quantitative real-time pcr method. in the chx group the total bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p > 0.05). chx mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.

TI  == effectiveness of ozone against periodontal pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == ozone has been proposed as an adjunct antiseptic in periodontitis therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of gaseous/aqueous ozone, in comparison with that of the established antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), against periodontal microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and parvimonas micra in planktonic or biofilm cultures were exposed, for 1 min, to gaseous ozone, aqueous ozone, chx, or phosphate-buffered saline (control). none of the agents was able to substantially reduce the a. actinomycetemcomitans count in biofilm cultures. in contrast, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. micra could be eliminated by 2% chx or by ozone gas at 53 gm(-3) . significantly greater antimicrobial effects were observed against planktonic cultures than against biofilm-associated bacteria. the rate of killing was influenced by the species of bacteria, and by the type and concentration of agent. there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of aqueous ozone (20 mug ml(-1) ) or gaseous ozone (>/= 4 gm(-3) ) compared with 2% chx but  they were more effective than 0.2% chx. therefore, high-concentrated gaseous and  aqueous ozone merit further investigation as antiseptics in periodontitis therapy. a safe system for applying gaseous ozone into the periodontal pocket that avoids inhalation still needs to be developed.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == periodontal conditions and prevalence of putative periodontopathogens and candida spp. in insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic  periodontitis--a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: the aims of this study were to evaluate periodontal conditions and identify the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and four different species of candida (c. albicans, c. dubliniensis, c. glabrata and c. tropicalis) in periodontal pockets  and furcation sites of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients with generalised chronic periodontitis. design: clinical parameters, including oral status assessed using plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, gingival recession and clinical attachment level and systemic conditions with fasting glucose level or glycosylated haemoglobin were measured in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis. samples of subgingival biofilm  were obtained from the periodontal pockets and furcation sites and submitted to phenol-chloroform dna extraction and pcr analysis using specific primers. results: clinical conditions of diabetic and non-diabetic patients were similar,  without statistical differences in both periodontal indexes and glucose levels (p>0.05). diabetics had a higher prevalence of candida spp., mainly c. albicans and c. dubliniensis, and a lower frequency of t. forsythia, when compared to non-diabetic patients, for both periodontal sites. c. glabrata and c. tropicalis  were not found in periodontal pockets and furcation sites of non-diabetic patients. conclusion: the results demonstrated a strong colonisation of candida spp. in the periodontal sites of diabetic patients that have generalised chronic  periodontitis with a higher prevalence of c. dubliniensis followed by c. albicans.

TI  == clarithromycin, as an adjunct to non surgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis: a double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objective: along with conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy (nspt) systemic antimicrobials may provide more effective treatment for chronic periodontitis by targeting tissue-invasive bacteria. the aim of this randomized,  placebo-controlled, double-masked clinical trial was to evaluate the adjunctive effects of oral clarithromycin (clm) to non-surgical periodontal therapy for chronic periodontitis. methods: 40 patients were categorized into two groups: test group - scaling and root planing (srp) plus clm (500 mg b.i.d. for 3 days) and control group - srp plus placebo. clinical parameters were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. they included gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). also microbial analysis of dental plaque was done at baseline, 3 and 9 months to estimate the levels of periodontopathic organisms using polymerase chain reaction. anova, chi-square and bonferroni tests were used for statistical analysis. results: thirty-seven subjects completed the study and the results demonstrated that both groups displayed clinical improvements. using a subject-based analysis, patients treated with srp+clm showed enhanced reductions in pd and gains in cal (p<0.001) over time, as compared to control group. also significant reductions in periodontopathic organisms were noticed in the test group compared to control group. however, no statistically significant differences were noted for tannerella forsythia levels between the groups during the course of the study. conclusions: the utilisation of clm in combination with srp improves the efficacy of nspt in reducing pd, improving cal and in lessening microbial loads. hence, clm may be beneficial in the non-surgical treatment regimen of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == a novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled-release chlorhexidine delivery in chronic periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: we aimed to analyze clinical, microbiologic, and serologic effects of chlorhexidine (chx) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing (srp). methods: twenty-four patients presenting with >/=12 teeth with probing depth (pd) >/=5 mm  and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups. after prophylaxis, chx chips (test) or placebo chips (control) were placed in pockets with pd >/=5 mm. ten days later, srp was performed in all teeth with pd >/=4 mm in a single appointment. immediately after srp, new chips were inserted in all pockets with pd >/=5 mm. parameters were assessed at baseline; beginning of srp;  and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. subgingival samples were obtained at baseline; beginning of srp; and at 1 month after treatment. periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were analyzed. serum levels of high sensitive c-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were  measured. the changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by mann-whitney u test (p <0.05). results: all clinical and serologic parameters  improved in both groups over time. there was a significant difference in clinical attachment level (cal) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups (1.17 mm in  the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group) (p <0.05). the treatment with chx chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the "red complex" after 1 month (p = 0.02). conclusion: the use of chx chips before and immediately after srp improved cal and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == microbial changes after full-mouth tooth extraction, followed by 2-stage implant  placement.
AB  == background: recent studies showed that qpcr could detect bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis in a low concentration after full-mouth tooth  extraction. this study monitored the microbiota from tooth extraction, over 9 months of full edentulism, up to 1 year after abutment connection. material and methods: ten patients with severe periodontitis were recruited. six months after  tooth extraction, implants were inserted. three to 6 months later, they were connected to abutments. plaque samples were collected from the tongue dorsum, saliva, and subgingival area (teeth/implants) before extraction up to 1 year after abutment connection, and analysed via culture, qpcr, and checkerboard technology. results: a reduction in the total amount of aerobic and anaerobic cfu/ml was observed. the concentration of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (qpcr and checkerboard) in the saliva and, to a lower extent, on the tongue dorsum reduced. for prevotella intermedia, changes were negligible and no  changes could be detected for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the pristine subgingival niches were quickly colonized by key pathogens. their final concentration remained low, while the detection frequencies remained very high over time. conclusion: complete edentulation results in a significant reduction of bacteria related to periodontitis and peri-implantitis, with the exception of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, which might indicate that key pathogens can survive without pockets.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == decreased phosphorylation of platelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in periodontitis--a role of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == introduction: epidemiological studies indicate an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (vasp) in its phosphorylated form represents a regulator of platelet function and an indicator  for the sensitivity of platelets towards physiologically relevant antagonists of  platelet function. as platelets and their activation state play a central role in the development of cardiovascular disease, this study aimed to investigate the influence of periodontal disease and periodontal pathogens on intraplatelet vasp-phosphorylation and platelet function. material and methods: besides several markers of platelet activation, basal and pge(1) induced intracellular vasp-phosphorylation were determined in platelets of periodontitis patients (n =  26) and healthy donors (n = 19). furthermore, platelets from healthy donors were  incubated with distinct periodontal pathogens and basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation was determined. results: compared to controls, platelets of  periodontitis patients showed a significant decrease in basal and pge(1) induced  vasp-phosphorylation. vasp-phosphorylation in platelets from periodontitis patients positive for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis or tannerella forsythia was significantly decreased compared to patients that were negative for these bacteria. furthermore, vasp-phosphorylation in platelets isolated from healthy donors was affected by incubation with these periodontal pathogens. conclusions: our results provide evidence that periodontitis interferes with vasp-phosphorylation in human platelets, presumably as a consequence of a direct effect of periodontitis-associated bacteria. decreased basal and pge(1) induced vasp-phosphorylation might represent a mechanism responsible for enhanced platelet activation in periodontitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == background: a limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, results are inconsistent. the aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with ra. methods: sixty-six patients with ra, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. the periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (psr/psi) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (psr/psi score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 4). pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. results: no patients were  periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. for most patients, fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), eikenella corrodens (91%), and parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis, 78%). statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (p = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (p >0.05). only smoking showed a significant influence (p = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of e. corrodens (p = 0.02). conclusions: most patients with ra in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. no association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess the presence of subgingival pathogens in peripheral blood samples from periodontitis patients before and after scaling and root planing (sc/rp) using nested polymerase chain reaction (nested pcr). materials and methods: peripheral blood samples were obtained from 42 patients with severe generalized chronic or aggressive periodontitis. in each patient, four samples of peripheral blood were drawn at different times: immediately before the sc/rp procedure; immediately after sc/rp; 15 and 30 min. post-sc/rp. blood samples were analysed for bacteraemia with anaerobic culturing and nested pcr, using universal bacterial primers that target the 16s-rrna gene of most bacteria, subsequently re-amplified with specific primers to porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus and prevotella intermedia, using a modified phenol-chloroform method for dna extraction. results: presence of specific periodontal pathogens in peripheral blood after treatment was detected in 54.8% of the patients, in 47.6% with anaerobic culturing and in 19% with nested pcr. in 16.6%, the periodontal pathogens were detected before sc/rp. p. gingivalis and a. actynomicetemcomitans were the pathogens most frequently detected in the bloodstream before and after sc/rp. conclusions: nested pcr demonstrated the presence of dna from periodontal pathogens in blood samples in severe periodontitis patients before, during and after periodontal therapy. the use of these molecular-based techniques may improve the accuracy from the results obtained by haemoculture.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == comparison of the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == comparison of real-time polymerase chain reaction and dna-strip technology in microbiological evaluation of periodontitis treatment.
AB  == the impact of a semiquantitative commercially available test based on dna-strip technology (microident(r), hain lifescience, nehren, germany) on diagnosis and treatment of severe chronic periodontitis of 25 periodontitis patients was evaluated in comparison with a quantitative in-house real-time pcr. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline as well as at 3, 6, and 12 months later. after extracting dna, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and several other periodontopathogens were determined by both methods. the results obtained by dna-strip technology were analyzed semiquantitatively and additionally quantitatively by densitometry. the results for the 4 major periodontopathogenic  bacterial species correlated significantly between the 2 methods. samples detecting a high bacterial load by one method and negative by the other were always found in less than 2% of the total samples. both technologies showed the impact of treatment on microflora. especially the semiquantitative dna-strip technology clearly analyzed the different loads of periodontopathogens after therapy and is useful in microbial diagnostics for patients in dental practices.

TI  == association of three bacterial species and periodontal status in chinese adults:  an epidemiological approach.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are oral pathogens associated with periodontitis. the association between these three bacteria and periodontal disease has been reported in populations of many countries. however, corresponding data in chinese populations are still lacking. the aim of this study was to detect these pathogens in subgingival plaque collected from 468 subjects with chronic periodontitis in a group of chinese adults by using a pcr method and to determine the degree of association between the target bacteria and periodontal status based on logistic  regression analysis. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia were found in 20.5%, 70.7%, and 77.1% of the subjects, respectively. about one-third (36.1%) of subjects had chronic periodontitis. upon univariate analysis, age, male gender, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans or p. gingivalis were positively associated with chronic periodontitis, whereas education and income exhibited inverse associations with chronic periodontitis. upon multivariate analysis, education, current smoking status, diabetes, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis  remained significant. the adjusted odds ratios for having chronic periodontitis were 2.5 and 3.4 in subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, respectively. however, no significant association was observed between the presence of t. forsythia and periodontal status. this study assesses  the prevalence of periodontal pathogens and chronic periodontitis and the associations with sociodemographic characteristics among this group of chinese adults. these findings also suggest that pcr should be considered for field oral  epidemiologic studies and may be necessary in investigations presenting major logistic challenges.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

TI  == clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with crohn's disease with consideration of the card15 genotype.
AB  == background: crohn's disease (cd) was reported to have oral manifestations. however, data on periodontal parameters and oral microbiology in cd are rare. recent studies showed associations of variants in the caspase recruitment domain  (card)15 gene with cd that are involved in the immune response toward bacterial products. our aim is to investigate the periodontal status and prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with cd under consideration of the card15 polymorphism. methods: oral soft tissue alterations and periodontal parameters of 147 patients with cd were assessed. subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for  the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa; previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella  forsythia (tf; previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia (pi), and campylobacter rectus (cr ) using dot-blot hybridization. card15 genotyping was performed with the a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based assay. results: a total of 36.7% of patients had oral manifestations predominated by gingival swellings (27.2%) and hyperplastic lesions of the buccal mucosa (20.4%). the mean probing depth and mean clinical attachment level were 3.6 and 3.8 mm, respectively. a total of 57.8% of the patients had a community periodontal index  of treatment needs (cpitn) score 3, and 31.3% of had a cpitn score 4. the prevalence of aa, pg, pi, tf, and cr was 76.9%, 62.6%, 79.6%, 64.6%, and 94.6%, respectively. pi was significantly less frequent in carriers of card15 mutations  compared to the wild type (69.7% versus 87.7%; p = 0.008). all other pathogens and clinical periodontal parameters did not differ significantly as to the card15 polymorphism. conclusions: our findings suggest that patients with cd have an increased prevalence and moderate severity of periodontitis. the colonization of  periodontal pathogens, in particular cr, might be of particular value for the periodontal manifestation of cd. although a modulating impact on periodontal microbiota can be supposed, our data do not support the role of card15 in oral symptoms and periodontal lesions in patients with cd.

TI  == profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == short-term effects of systemic antibiotics during periodontal healing.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the short-term effects of nonsurgical therapy (scaling and root planing, srp) on the subgingival microbiota in chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontal disease. method and materials: ninety-seven cp and ap subjects underwent full-mouth srp on 2 consecutive days. ap patients were randomly assigned to either receive systemic metronidazole plus amoxicillin (ap+ab) or were treated mechanically alone (ap). pathogens were identified with 16s rrna oligodeoxynucleotide probes and dot-blot hybridization before and at days 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 21 of healing. cp subjects were treated by scaling and root planing along with placebo tablets. results: initially, ap cell counts were  69.9- (porphyromonas gingivalis), 10.2- (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans),  5.7- (tannerella forsythia), and 3.3-fold (prevotella intermedia) enhanced compared to cp cell counts. following srp, immediate elimination occurred in single individuals of all three treatment groups at day 2. after srp plus antibiotic therapy (ap+ab), the prevalence scores dropped beyond the levels of ap and cp, beginning at day 7, and remained low until day 21 (p =or< .05). clinical  healing statistically benefited from srp with no differences among the three treatment groups. conclusion: nonsurgical therapy resulted in both a suppression  and early elimination of single taxa immediately after completion of active treatment. systemic antibiotics significantly accelerate the suppression of the periodontal microflora, but have limited effect on the elimination of target isolates during healing.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == comparison of two different microbiological test kits for detection of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to compare the outcome of two different microbiological tests for detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.) and treponema denticola (t.d.). material and methods: a total of 69 adult patients with severe chronic (scp) or aggressive periodontitis (agp) participated in the study. microbiological samples were examined for a.a., p.g., t.f. and t.d. using  an rna probe test (pado) and a real-time polymerase chain reaction test (meri). results: for all periodontal pathogens under investigation, the median bacterial  counts detected with pado were smaller compared to those detected with meri. p.g., t.f. and t.d. could be found in the majority of all patients with both tests. with meri, a.a. was detected more often (24.6%) than with pado (18.8%). only 10.1% of the patients tested positive for a.a. with both tests. conclusion:  both tests showed a high percentage of agreement for p.g., t.f. and t.d., but exhibited marked differences in the detection of a.a.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of a genius nd:yag laser.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the nd:yag laser (genius, molsgaard dental, copenhagen, denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. methods: suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra) were prepared in small eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a nd:yag laser for five different periods of time. laser settings used: power 6 watt (on a scale of 1-12 w), frequency 50 hz, pulse duration 250 mus. after exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. results: after 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. after 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. conclusion: in this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of nd:yag laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == evaluating clinical periodontal measures as surrogates for bacterial exposure: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest).
AB  == background: epidemiologic studies of periodontal infection as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease often use clinical periodontal measures as a surrogate for the underlying bacterial exposure of interest. there are currently no methodological studies evaluating which clinical periodontal measures best reflect the levels of subgingival bacterial colonization in population-based settings. we investigated the characteristics of clinical periodontal definitions that were most representative of exposure to bacterial species that are believed  to be either markers, or themselves etiologic, of periodontal disease. methods: 706 men and women aged >or= 55 years, residing in northern manhattan were enrolled. using dna-dna checkerboard hybridization in subgingival biofilms, standardized values for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were averaged within mouth and summed to define "bacterial burden". correlations of bacterial burden with clinical periodontal constructs defined by the severity and extent of attachment loss (al), pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed. results: clinical periodontal constructs demonstrating the highest correlations with bacterial burden were: i) percent of sites with bop (r = 0.62); ii) percent of sites with pd >or= 3 mm (r = 0.61); and iii) number of sites with  bop (r = 0.59). increasing pd or al severity thresholds consistently attenuated correlations, i.e., the correlation of bacterial burden with the percent of sites with pd >or= 8 mm was only r = 0.16. conclusions: clinical exposure definitions of periodontal disease should incorporate relatively shallow pockets to best reflect whole mouth exposure to bacterial burden.

TI  == differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors slpi, elafin,  scca1, and scca2.
AB  == objective: secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (slpi), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (scca1 and scca2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. to determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants  of various periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. design: the gene expression and secretion of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were determined using real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. the direct effects of periopathogens and p. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by western blot. the effect on the innate immune response of gecs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hbd2) and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 (ccl20). results: we found that slpi, scca2, elafin, hbd2,  and ccl20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to p. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in  response to stimulation by other bacteria. p. gingivalis reduced the secretion of slpi and elafin significantly in gecs, and degraded recombinant slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2. differential degradation patterns of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were observed with different bacteria as well as p. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by p. gingivalis. in addition, pretreatment of gecs with slpi, scca1, or scca2 partially blocked hbd2  and ccl20 mrna expression in response to p. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. conclusion: our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the  host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. the balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.

TI  == association of human t lymphotropic virus 1 amplification of periodontitis severity with altered cytokine expression in response to a standard periodontopathogen infection.
AB  == background: periodontal diseases (pds) are infectious diseases in which periodontopathogens trigger chronic inflammatory and immune responses that lead to tissue destruction. recently, viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pds. individuals infected with human t lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1) present with abnormal oral health and a marked increased prevalence of periodontal disease. methods: in this study, we investigated the patterns of periodontopathogen infection and local inflammatory immune markers in htlv-1-seropositive individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp/htlv-1 group) compared with htlv-1-seronegative individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp group) and periodontally healthy, htlv-1-seronegative individuals (control group). results: patients in the cp/htlv-1 group had significantly higher values  of bleeding on probing, mean probing depth, and attachment loss than patients in  the cp group. the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (il)  4 was found to be similar in the cp and cp/htlv-1 groups, whereas il-12 and il-17 levels trended toward a higher expression in the cp/htlv-1 group. a significant increase was seen in the levels of il-1beta and interferon gamma in the cp/htlv-1 group compared with the cp group, whereas expression of the regulatory t cell marker foxp3 and il-10 was significantly decreased in the lesions from the cp/htlv-1 group. interestingly, similar frequency and/or load of periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and frequency of viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, human cytomegalovirus, and epstein-barr virus) characteristically associated with pds were found in the cp/htlv and cp groups. conclusions: htlv-1 may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease through the deregulation of the local cytokine network, resulting in an exacerbated response against a standard periodontopathogen infection.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover  of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI  == do periodontopathogens disappear after full-mouth tooth extraction?
AB  == aim: to monitor the intra-oral microbiological changes after full-mouth extraction using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). material and methods: nine patients with severe, aggressive periodontitis, for whom a full-mouth tooth extraction was the only remaining treatment option were recruited. before and 6 months after extraction, microbial samples were obtained  (tongue, saliva and subgingival plaque) and analysed by qpcr. results: the elimination of subgingival niches, by extraction of all natural teeth, resulted in a 3-log reduction of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia, and more modest reductions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia. however, the detection frequencies of these periodontopathogens in saliva and on the tongue remained unchanged after full-mouth tooth extraction. conclusion: in contrast to what has been believed so far, full-mouth tooth extraction does not result in eradication of all periodontopathogens but only in  a significant reduction. the clinical consequences of this observation remain speculative.

TI  == clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == subgingival bacterial colonization profiles correlate with gingival tissue gene expression.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the microbiota of the periodontal pocket. we investigated the association between subgingival bacterial profiles and gene expression patterns in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. a total of 120 patients undergoing periodontal surgery contributed with a minimum of two interproximal gingival papillae (range  2-4) from a maxillary posterior region. prior to tissue harvesting, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial and distal aspects of each tissue sample. gingival tissue rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with whole-genome microarrays (310 in total). plaque samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations with respect to 11 bacterial species. random effects linear regression models considered bacterial levels as exposure and expression profiles as outcome variables. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: wide inter-species variation was noted in the number of differentially expressed gingival tissue genes according to subgingival bacterial levels: using  a bonferroni correction (p < 9.15 x 10(-7)), 9,392 probe sets were differentially associated with levels of tannerella forsythia, 8,537 with porphyromonas gingivalis, 6,460 with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, 506 with eikenella  corrodens and only 8 with actinomyces naeslundii. cluster analysis identified commonalities and differences among tissue gene expression patterns differentially regulated according to bacterial levels. conclusion: our findings  suggest that the microbial content of the periodontal pocket is a determinant of  gene expression in the gingival tissues and provide new insights into the differential ability of periodontal species to elicit a local host response.

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == clinical, histological, and microbiological findings in peri-implant disease: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: this study is intended to verify the correlation among clinical indices of the peri-implant soft tissues, the histological condition and the presence of 3 pathogens commonly associated with peri-implant diseases (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella  forsythia). materials: four clinical indices, gingival index (gi), sulcus bleeding index, gi modified by mombelli, and plaque index modified by mombelli (mpi) were evaluated around 1 dental implant of each subject (n = 10). subgingival plaque was collected for bacterial analysis (polymerase chain reaction) and a biopsy of peri-implant soft tissues for histological analysis was harvested. the clinical indices and detected pathogens correlated with a developed histological index (hi). results: there was no statistically significant relationship between the clinical indices (gi, sulcus bleeding index, and gi modified by mombelli) and the hi, except for the mpi on the central area of lingual aspects (r = 0.85, p = 0.0029). there was a tendency for a positive correlation between the mpi on the central area of buccal aspects and the hi (r = 0.63, p = 0.0544). the counting of lymphocytes and plasmocytes correlated positively with hi, thus suggesting the index reliability. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia did not present a significant relationship with the hi. conclusion: despite the small number of samples and the poor statistical significance, the mpi seems to be useful for evaluation of inflammatory severity on soft tissue around dental implants as demonstrated by its relationship with the hi. further studies are necessary to elucidate this subject.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == full-mouth ultrasonic debridement associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic effects of the systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole in the full-mouth ultrasonic debridement of patients with severe chronic periodontitis. methods: twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with probing depth (pd) > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were selected and randomly assigned to full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + placebo (control group) or full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + amoxicillin and metronidazole (test group). the clinical outcomes evaluated were  visible plaque index, bop, position of the gingival margin, relative attachment level (ral), and pd. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for quantitative analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis). the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) technique permitted the detection of prostaglandin e(2,) interleukin-1beta, and interferon-gamma levels in gingival crevicular fluid. all  parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. results: at 6 months, the test treatment resulted in lower bop and an additional  reduction (0.83 mm) in pd (p <0.05). data also showed ral gain > or =2 mm at 43.52% of sites in control patients compared to 58.03% of sites in test patients  (p <0.05). however, both groups had similar mean ral gain (1.68 and 1.88 mm for the control and test groups, respectively). real-time pcr and elisa failed to identify significant differences between the groups. conclusions: both treatments resulted in significant clinical improvements; however, there was a slight, but significantly greater, improvement in bop and the percentage of sites with pd > or =5 mm exhibiting ral gain > or =2 mm in the test group. nevertheless, no improvement in the microbiologic or immunologic outcome was observed with the adjunctive use of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == systemic immune responses in pregnancy and periodontitis: relationship to pregnancy outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study.
AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == probiotic effects of orally administered lactobacillus salivarius wb21-containing tablets on periodontopathic bacteria: a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: this study was designed to evaluate whether the oral administration of lactobacilli could change the bacterial population in supra/subgingival plaque. material and methods: sixty-six healthy volunteers without severe periodontitis were randomized into two groups to receive lactobacilli or placebo for 8 weeks (8w): the test group (n=34) received 2.01 x 10(9) cfu/day of lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablets; the control group (n=32) received placebo with xylitol. supra/subgingival plaque samples were collected at the baseline and after 4 weeks (4w) and 8w. the bacterial amounts in plaque samples were analysed  by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria in the test group was decreased significantly in subgingival plaque at 4w [odds ratio (or)=3.13, 95% confidence intervals (ci)=1.28-7.65, p=0.012]. multivariate analysis showed that significantly higher odds were obtained for the reduction of tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque of the test group at both 4w (or=6.69, 95% ci=2.51-17.9, p<0.001) and 8w (or=3.67, 95% ci=1.45-9.26, p=0.006). conclusion: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli reduced the numerical sum of five selected periodontopathic bacteria and could contribute to the beneficial effects on periodontal conditions.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == background and objective: inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high between-subject variation in the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha mrna has been verified, which may be a result of genetic polymorphisms and/or the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (called the red complex) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the effect of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfa) -308g/a gene polymorphism and of periodontopathogens on the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking patients with chronic periodontitis (n = 127) and in control subjects  (n = 177). material and methods: the tnfa -308g/a single nucleotide polymorphism  was investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, whereas the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and the periodontopathogen load were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: no statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of the tnfa -308 single nucleotide polymorphism in control and chronic  periodontitis groups, in spite of the higher frequency of the a allele in the chronic periodontitis group. the concomitant analyses of genotypes and periodontopathogens demonstrated that tnfa -308 ga/aa genotypes and the red-complex periodontopathogens were independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in periodontal tissues, and no additive effect was seen when both factors were present. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and t. denticola counts were positively correlated with the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. tnfa -308 genotypes were not associated with the periodontopathogen detection odds or with the bacterial load. conclusion: our results demonstrate that the tnfa -308 a allele and red-complex periodontopathogens are independently associated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in diseased tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis patients and consequently are potentially involved in determining the disease outcome.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

TI  == differences in subgingival microflora of korean and german periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to characterize the microbiological profile in samples of subgingival plaque taken from periodontal patients with different ethnic origin. methods: 178 patients (n=90 from south korea and n=88 from germany; age: 45.4 +/- 10.4 years) were diagnosed with severe generalized periodontitis. in all patients the deepest pocket of each quadrant was sampled for subgingival plaque. the four samples per patient were pooled and subsequently analysed with a 16s-rna-gene probe test. results: prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was significantly higher in german patients (47.7%) compared to korean patients (26.7%) (p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). for tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis, differences between germans and koreans were not as pronounced. a statistically significant difference could also be found for treponema denticola (germans: 95.5%, koreans: 81.1%, p < 0.01, chi(2)-test). after logarithmic transformation, bacterial counts differed for all microorganisms under investigation between germans and koreans, even after using  a general linear model/analysis of covariance (glm/ancova) to adjust for gender,  age, smoking status, pocket probing depths (ppd) of sampled teeth, and gingival bleeding index (gbi). conclusion: depending on their ethnic origin, the microbiological profile of pooled subgingival plaque sample seems to differ significantly between patients of caucasian and asian ethnic origin.

TI  == detection of herpesviruses and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis, or gingivitis.
AB  == background: herpesviruses may be related to the etiology of aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp) by triggering periodontal destruction or by increasing the risk for bacterial infection. this case-control  study evaluated the presence of herpes simplex virus type i (hsv-1), epstein-barr virus type i (ebv-1), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in patients with generalized agp (agp group), cp (cp group), or gingivitis (g group) and in healthy individuals (c group). methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points from 30 patients in each group. the nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect  hsv-1, ebv-1, and hcmv. bacteria were identified by 16s rrna-based pcr. results:  hsv-1, hcmv, and ebv-1 were detected in 86.7%, 46.7%, and 33.3% of the agp group, respectively; in 40.0%, 50.0%, and 46.7% of the cp group, respectively; in 53.3%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of the g group, respectively; and in 20.0%, 56.7%, and 0.0% of the c group, respectively. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected significantly more often in the agp group compared to the other groups (p <0.005). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were identified more frequently in agp and cp groups, and agp, cp, and g groups had higher frequencies of p. intermedia compared to the c group. conclusion: in brazilian patients, hsv-1 and ebv-1, rather than hcmv, were more frequently associated with cp and agp.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI  == influence of the menstrual cycle on the oral microbial flora in women: a case-control study including men as control subjects.
AB  == changes in the levels of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle may cause cyclic differences in subgingival bacterial colonization patterns. the purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle cause changes in the oral microbiota. methods: bacterial plaque samples were collected in 20 systemically and periodontally healthy women using no hormonal contraceptives (test group) over a period of 6 weeks. twenty age-matched systemically and periodontally healthy men were assigned to the control group. samples were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay, and 74 species were analyzed. results: no cyclic pattern of bacterial colonization was identified for any of the 74 species studied in women not using  hormonal contraceptives. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (y4) was common at the beginning of menstruation (mean: 32%) and increased during the following 2 weeks (36%) in women (p <0.05). no cyclic differences in bacterial presence were found among the men (p values varied between 0.14 and 0.98). men presented with significantly higher bacterial counts for 40 of 74 species (p <0.001), including staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.15) or  tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.42). conclusions: during a menstruation period, cyclic variation in the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy women of child-bearing age who were not using oral hormonal contraceptives could not be confirmed. male control subjects presented with higher levels of many species but also without a cyclic pattern.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

AB  == this study used a nested multiplex pcr method to detect three periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque collected before treatment and at 2 and 6 months  posttreatment from 107 patients with severe, generalized periodontitis. the proportions of the patients who harbored these bacteria before periodontal treatment were as follows: tannerella forsythia, 81%; porphyromonas gingivalis, 78%; and aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, 47%. at 2 months posttreatment there was a significant reduction in the numbers of patients harboring p. gingivalis (46%; p < 0.001) or t. forsythia (63%; p = 0.043) but not a. actinomycetemcomitans (50%) compared to pretreatment data. at 6 months posttreatment, significantly fewer patients harbored p. gingivalis (43%; p < 0.001); a. actinomycetemcomitans, (31%; p = 0.025), or t. forsythia (63%; p = 0.030). interestingly, at baseline and at 2 months posttherapy, subjects who harbored only a single pathogen had a greater level of periodontal disease than subjects who harbored two, or all three, of these periodontal pathogens. these data suggest that a reduction in the number of species present may be associated  with an increase in the severity of periodontal diseases.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == periodontal debridement as a therapeutic approach for severe chronic periodontitis: a clinical, microbiological and immunological study.
AB  == aim: to clinically, microbiologically and immunologically characterize periodontal debridement as a therapeutic approach for severe chronic periodontitis. material and methods: twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with a probing pocket depth (ppd) of >or=5 mm and bleeding on probing (bop) were selected and randomly assigned to quadrant-wise scaling and root planing or one session of full-mouth periodontal debridement. the following clinical outcomes were assessed: plaque index, bop, position of gingival margin,  relative attachment level (ral) and ppd. real-time pcr was used for quantitative  analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay permitted the detection of il-1beta, prostaglandin e(2), inf-gamma and il-10 in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). all the parameters were evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. results: both the groups had similar means of ppd reduction and attachment gain over time. besides a significant reduction in the bacterial level after treatment in both groups, microbiological analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences between them. finally, no difference was observed between groups with respect to the levels of inflammatory mediators in gcf. conclusion: periodontal debridement resulted in a similar clinical, microbiological and immunological outcome when compared with standard scaling and root planing and therefore may be a viable approach to deal with severe chronic periodontitis.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. primers were designed from the 16s ribosomal rna gene for each pathogen, and the lamp amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees c.  to simplify the manipulation of lamp examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were tested as templates besides extracted dna template. the detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted dna template. however, lamp methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. lamps for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity  compared with the conventional real-time pcr method. these findings suggest the usefulness of the lamp method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis  of periodontitis, and the possibility of lamp examination without the dna extraction step.

TI  == an interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 and red complex periodontopathogens independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in diseased periodontal tissues.
AB  == inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a high individual variation in the levels of il-1beta mrna has been verified, which is possibly determined by genetic polymorphisms and/or by the presence of periodontopathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. in this study, we investigated the role of an il-1beta promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 3954 [il-1beta(3954) snp] and the presence of the periodontopathogens in the determination of the il-1beta levels in the periodontal tissues of nonsmoking chronic periodontitis (cp) patients (n = 117) and control (c) subjects (n = 175) and the possible correlations with the clinical parameters of the disease. il-1beta(3954) snp was  investigated by restriction fragment length polymorphism, while the il-1beta levels and the presence of the periodontopathogens were determined by real-time pcr. similar frequencies of il-1beta(3954) snp were found in the c and cp groups, in spite of a trend toward a higher incidence of t alleles in the cp group. the il-1beta(3954) snp ct and tt genotypes, as well as p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, were associated with higher il-1beta levels and with higher values of the clinical parameters of disease severity. concomitant analyses demonstrate that il-1beta(3954) and the red complex periodontopathogens were found to independently and additively modulate the levels of il-1beta in periodontal tissues. similarly, the concurrent presence of both factors was associated with increased scores of disease severity. il-1beta(3954) genotypes and red complex periodontopathogens, individually and additively, modulate the levels of il-1beta in the diseased tissues of nonsmoking cp patients and, consequently, are potentially involved in the determination of the disease outcome.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == antibody levels to single bacteria or in combination evaluated against myocardial infarction.
AB  == background: evidence is accumulating that oral bacteria are associated with myocardial infarctions (mi). we were interested in studying the differences in the association between single bacteria or bacteria in combination and the relation to c-reactive protein (crp). material and methods: we examined the levels of antibodies against four major periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia (tf) and treponema denticola (td) and crp in 548 men with a self-reported history of mi to 625 controls who took part in the oslo ii study in 2000. results: the mean levels of bacterial antibodies were higher for the cases than the controls,  but not significant as standard deviations were large. the level of crp was higher in the cases than the controls (p=0.010). logistic regression analyses comparing the upper quartile value with the lower value of one of either four antibodies (anti-aa, anti-tf, anti-td and anti-pg) were significantly associated  (p=0.032) with mi. equivalent analyses of either three bacteria showed significant associations for anti-aa, anti-td and anti-pg (p=0.036) and anti-aa,  anti-pg and anti-tf (p=0.040). crp showed an increased relative risk with increasing quartile value; trend, p=0.016, but not in multivariate analysis including the oral antigens. conclusions: no single bacterium but rather combinations were related to increasing relative risk for mi independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == interleukin-6 polymorphisms are associated with pathogenic bacteria in subjects with periodontitis.
AB  == background: growing evidence suggests that individual genetic susceptibility may  influence the host's response to infections. previously, we showed that a common  variation in the interleukin (il)-6 gene was associated with increased odds of detection of common periodontal pathogens from individuals with aggressive periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between il-6 polymorphisms and periodontopathogenic bacteria in a larger, ethnically mixed population of subjects with periodontitis. methods: genomic dna was extracted from 107 subjects diagnosed with severe forms of periodontitis to study a cluster of polymorphisms in inflammatory genes, including il-6. the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) in their subgingival biofilm was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. serum il-6 and c-reactive protein (crp) concentrations were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the il-6 -6106 polymorphism was associated with the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.009; odds ratio [or] = 3.5; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.38 to 9.16) and the concomitant detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis (p = 0.015; or = 3.6; 95% ci: 1.28 to 10.04). the il-6 -174 polymorphism was associated with increased odds of the concomitant detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis (p = 0.042; or = 2.8; 95% ci: 1.04 to 7.75). haplotype analysis of all five il-6 polymorphisms confirmed an association with the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.046). the il-6 -6106 polymorphism was also associated with crp serum levels at multivariate analysis (p = 0.024). conclusions: these findings confirm the hypothesis that complex interactions between the microbiota and host genome are at the basis of susceptibility to periodontitis. periodontal disease may represent a useful model to study the pathways and mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in inflammatory diseases.

TI  == etiological analysis of initial colonization of periodontal pathogens in oral cavity.
AB  == it is unclear when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity. therefore, we report here the association between specific age groups and the time when the initial colonization by periodontal pathogens occurs in the oral cavity in such groups. findings are based on an epidemiological analysis of the prevalence of five periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of  a wide range of age populations, from newborn to elderly, who were randomly selected in a geographic region of brazil. these periodontal pathogens include campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythia and were analyzed in the bacterial samples isolated from gingival sulcus, the dorsum of the tongue, and cheek mucosa of diverse age groups, using a bacterial dna-specific pcr method. results indicated that there are distinct age-related groups where initial colonization by the five periodontal pathogens examined in this study can be detected and that the presence of teeth is a permissive factor  for colonization by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia. although it remains unclear exactly how or when target pathogens colonize healthy subjects, an understanding of age-related groups does provide a potentially useful tool in  the early detection and prevention of periodontitis in healthy individuals.

TI  == quantitative analysis of association between herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the development of human periodontitis may depend upon  cooperative interactions among herpesviruses, specific pathogenic bacteria and tissue-destructive inflammatory mediators. this study sought to identify associations among human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and six putative periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis lesions. material and methods: fifteen periodontitis patients (nine with aggressive periodontitis and six with chronic periodontitis) and 15 periodontally normal subjects were included in the study. in each study subject, a microbiological sample was collected, using a curette, from the deepest periodontal probing depth of the dentition. a real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was employed to determine the subgingival counts  of human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus. statistical analysis was performed using the student's t-test, the pearson correlation coefficient test and the single variable logistic regression test for odds ratio-based risk calculation. results: human cytomegalovirus was detected in eight periodontitis lesions and in one normal periodontal site, epstein-barr virus was detected in nine periodontitis lesions and in two normal periodontal sites, and the study bacteria were detected in 6-15 periodontitis lesions and in  1-11 normal periodontal sites. correlations were found between counts of human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus, between counts of human cytomegalovirus and p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and c. rectus, and between counts of epstein-barr virus and p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr  virus counts were also positively associated with the level of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and gingival bleeding on probing. conclusion: this study confirmed that periodontal human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus are associated with major periodontopathic bacteria and with the severity of periodontal disease. the finding of abundant herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions redefines the pathogenic paradigm of the disease. understanding the interplay between herpesviruses and specific bacterial species  in the pathogenesis of periodontitis may form the basis for new approaches to preventing, reducing or delaying tissue breakdown from periodontal infections.

TI  == prevalence of fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis and periodontal health status in chinese adults.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae play a key role in colonization of the oral cavity. the fima gene, which encodes fimbrillin (fima),  can be classified into six types (i-v and ib) according to nucleotide sequence. in the present study, we investigated the relationship between the prevalence of  p. gingivalis-specific fima genotypes and periodontal health status in chinese adults. material and methods: one-hundred and fifteen patients with chronic periodontitis and 136 periodontally healthy adults were selected. p. gingivalis detection, determination of fima genotypes, and the co-existence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia with various fima types, were assessed by the polymerase chain reaction. odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for associating the fima-specific genes with periodontitis. results: p. gingivalis was detected in 22.1% of healthy subjects and in 81.7% of the patients. a single fima genotype was detected in most samples. in healthy adults, the most prevalent fima genotype was type i (66.7%).  however, type ii was detected most frequently (43.6%) in the patient group, followed by type iv (30.9%). the frequency of co-existing a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia was highest in type ii fima-positive sites. statistical analysis revealed that periodontitis was associated with occurrences of type i (odds ratio 0.97), ib (odds ratio 13.26), ii (odds ratio 36.62), iii (odds ratio 4.57), iv (odds ratio 22.86) and v (odds ratio 1.19). conclusion: p. gingivalis type ii followed by type iv were considered as disease-associated strains that account for the pathogenesis of chronic periodontitis in chinese adults.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == microbiologic analysis of periodontal pockets and carotid atheromatous plaques in advanced chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless,  a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim  of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for  general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive  for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive  for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

TI  == bacterial colonization immediately after installation on oral titanium implants.
AB  == background: information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited. aims: (1) to assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. results: comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of veillonella parvula (p<0.05) differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. included among these bacteria at implant sites were porphyromonas gingivalis (p<0.05), tannerella forsythia, (p<0.01), and treponema denticola (p<0.001). immediately post-surgery 5.9% of implants, and 26.2% of teeth, and at week 12, 15% of implants, and 39.1% of teeth harbored staphylococcus aureus. comparing tooth and  implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. this difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically. conclusions: bacterial colonization occurred within 30 min after implant placement. early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromatous plaques.
AB  == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna  amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively.  no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == oral bacteria in plaque and invading buccal cells of young orthodontic patients.
AB  == introduction: in this longitudinal study, patients with fixed orthodontic appliances served as models to determine whether actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and total streptococci increased after treatment, and whether treatment affected bacterial invasion into the adjacent buccal epithelial cells (bec). methods: supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, and bec were collected from 27 patients before and at least 4 weeks after placement of orthodontic fixed appliances. total sample dna was determined, and bacteria were assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  the bec were also examined by confocal microscopy after fluorescent in-situ hybridization to visually detect the presence of each species bacteria in bec. results: total dna in supragingival and subgingival plaque increased after appliance placement (p = .005). there was also a significant increase in supragingival streptococci (p = .0002). by confocal microscopy, a trend toward fewer buccal cells recovered was found after appliance placement, and there was a significant increase in the percentage of buccal cells containing a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = .0058). conclusions: appliance placement appeared to increase buccal cell susceptibility to a. actinomycetemcomitans invasion. this might be due to physical trauma or to leaching of metals from the appliances.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongue dorsum of elderly people.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of  teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of  85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue  care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of different antimicrobials on generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: to evaluate and compare the effects of adjunctive metronidazole plus amoxicillin, doxycycline and metronidazole on clinical and microbiological parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: forty-three patients participated in this randomized clinical trial divided into four groups. six weeks after scaling and root planning (srp), groups 1-3 received adjunctive metronidazole, plus amoxicillin, doxycycline and metronidazole respectively, and group 4 acted as controls. clinical recordings concerning probing depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing were performed at baseline, 6 weeks after srp and 6 months from baseline. subgingival  samples were analysed using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization for porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola. results: all treatments resulted in improvement of clinical parameters (anova p > 0.05). systemic administration of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or metronidazole resulted in statistically significant greater reduction of the proportion of sites > 6 mm than srp (z-test, p < 0.05). these antimicrobials yielded a significant effect on levels of important periodontal pathogens for 6 months. conclusion: adjunctive metronidazole plus amoxicillin or metronidazole alone (when a.actinomycetemcomitans is not involved) is effective in deep pockets of aggressive periodontitis patients.

TI  == characterization of patients presenting for treatment to a university refractory  periodontal diseases unit: three case reports.
AB  == background: of the many forms of periodontal disease, refractory periodontal diseases are the least characterized. they are defined as the continued degeneration of the periodontium despite adequate management. this has led to the suggestion that there may be a systemic component that is a contributing factor to the development of this condition. the objectives of this report were to follow the progression of clinical changes associated with periodontal disease over a number of years in this unique population and review various hematologic and microbiologic factors that may be contributing to the disease progression. methods: three subjects were profiled. they were referred to the refractory periodontal disease unit at the university of toronto by periodontists or general practitioners in the southern ontario region. complete medical and dental histories were obtained along with baseline clinical measurements. periodontal examinations were facilitated with the use of a computer-assisted periodontal probe. a microbiologic analysis using immunofluorescence techniques was able to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and spirochetes. a hematologic analysis, including a complete blood count (cbc), immune profile, and glycosylated hemoglobin assay, was also performed. results: the clinical presentation revealed that patients receiving adequate maintenance therapy and with good to excellent oral hygiene demonstrated sites with continual loss of attachment. few periodontal pathogens were detected. however, the most significant finding appeared to be the report elevated levels of cd8+ cells within this group of patients compared to normal laboratory ranges. conclusions: this report is an attempt at characterizing a unique population within the periodontal realm. the long-term monitoring of these patients allowed for an assessment of factors that  may be involved in the continued decline of the periodontal health of these patients. based on the immune profile, it is possible that a hyperresponsive state may be the primary feature of this population. future assessments, including full-mouth interleukin (il)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8 levels, may assist in characterizing this population further, with the goal of producing markers that will assist clinicians in predicting treatment outcome.

TI  == supportive periodontal therapy using mechanical instrumentation or 2% minocycline gel: a 12 month randomized, controlled, single masked pilot study.
AB  == objective: to compare the short-term performance of subgingival local delivery of 2% minocycline gel and conventional subgingival debridement in supportive periodontal therapy (spt) patients. methods: forty adult patients having completed active treatment for moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis were included in a randomized, controlled, single masked maintenance care pilot study. sites with residual pocket probing depths > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing were treated with either minocycline gel (minocycline-group) or scaling and root planing only (debridement-group) at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  results: full-mouth plaque and bleeding scores remained <10% and <20%, respectively, for both groups throughout the study. in both groups there was a persistent reduction in number of teeth and sites with probing pocket depths > or =5 mm (p<0.05) with no significant differences between the groups. the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, remained at levels < or =10(5) in the majority of patients and sites  in both groups. conclusion: this pilot study failed to show a difference between  local delivery of 2% minocycline gel as mono-therapy and traditional subgingival  debridement in patients on spt.

TI  == relationship of periodontal bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis fima variations with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the relationship between phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (go) and the harboring of periodontal bacteria. materials and methods: periodontal conditions and subgingival bacterial profiles were examined in 450 sites of 75 subjects. a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect six bacterial species; porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), and prevotella nigrescens (pn). genetic variations of the pg fima gene were also examined. bacterial occurrence was compared with the severity of go, and alterations in the bacterial occurrence rate and quantities were monitored following periodontal treatment. results: the occurrences of aa, td, pi, pn, and pg with type ii fima (type ii pg) were significantly associated with the severity of go. td occurrence was reduced in association with gingival improvement following ultrasonic scaling, however, no such relationship was observed with aa, pi, pn, and pg. in addition, pg and pi markedly persisted after treatment. clinical improvement of the sites, following an er:yag laser treatment, significantly associated with quantitative reduction of pg in improved sites, however, not that of pi. conclusion: type ii pg and td were each found to  have a significant relationship with the development and deterioration of go.

TI  == detection of periodontopathic bacteria and an oxidative stress marker in saliva from periodontitis patients.
AB  == we assessed the salivary levels of periodontopathic bacteria and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) in patients with periodontitis. the salivary levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus) were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. the 8-ohdg levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the salivary levels of 8-ohdg, p. gingivalis,  and t. forsythia in the periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects. by contrast, the a. actinomycetemcomitans level in healthy subjects was higher than that in periodontitis patients. 8-ohdg was significantly correlated with p. gingivalis. statistically significant decreases  in the levels of p. gingivalis, probing depth, bleeding on probing, and 8-ohdg were observed after initial periodontal treatment. these results suggest that the 8-ohdg levels in saliva reflect the load of periodontal pathogens. 8-ohdg could be a useful biomarker for assessing periodontal status accurately, and for evaluating the efficacy of periodontal treatment.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial interrelationships in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: recent findings have begun to provide a basis for a causal link between herpesviruses and aggressive periodontitis. one theory is that herpesviruses cooperate with specific bacteria in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. this study examined whether the presence of herpesviruses [human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) type 1, herpes simplex virus (hsv) type 1 and 2] is associated with the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia,  campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in aggressive periodontitis lesions. methods: the study included 18 young adults with advanced  periodontitis and 16 periodontally healthy subjects from ankara, turkey. subgingival specimens pooled from two sites in each subject were collected by a periodontal curette. qualitative polymerase chain reaction methodology was used to identify herpesviruses and bacteria. chi-square tests were employed to determine statistical associations among herpesviruses, bacteria and periodontal  disease. results: hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were each detected in 72-78% of the aggressive periodontitis patients. hsv-2 occurred in 17% of the periodontitis patients. ebv-1 was detected in one periodontally healthy subject. the study bacteria occurred in 78-83% (p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, c. rectus) and in 44% (p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the periodontitis samples, and in 0-19% of the samples from healthy periodontal sites. hcmv, ebv-1 and hsv-1 were positively associated with p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and c. rectus, but not with a. actinomycetemcomitans. hsv-2 was not associated with any  test bacteria. conclusions: these results support the notion that the clinical outcome of some types of severe periodontal infection depends on the presence of  specific herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens. our findings open the door to testing a variety of hypotheses regarding the deleterious aspects of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections in periodontal sites.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.
