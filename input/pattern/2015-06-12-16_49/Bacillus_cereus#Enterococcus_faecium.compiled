TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Immunomodulatory effect of non-viable components of probiotic culture stimulated  with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on holoxenic mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Competition of probiotic bacteria with other species from the intestinal microbiota involves different mechanisms that occur regardless of probiotics' viability. The objective of this paper was to assess the cytokine serum levels in holoxenic mice after oral administration of non-viable components (NVC) of Enterococcus faecium probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus in comparison to NVC of unstimulated E. faecium probiotic culture. METHODS: Probiotic E. faecium CMGb 16 culture, grown in the presence of heat-inactivated cultures of E. coli and B. cereus CMGB 102, was subsequently separated into supernatant (SN) and heat-inactivated cellular sediment (CS) fractions by centrifugation. Each NVC was orally administered to holoxenic mice (balb C mouse strain), in three doses, given at 24 hours. Blood samples were collected from the retinal artery, at 7, 14, and 21 days after the first administration of the NVC. The serum concentrations of IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukins were assessed by ELISA method. RESULTS: After the oral administration of SN component obtained from the probiotic culture stimulated with heat-inactivated cultures of B. cereus CMGB 102 and E. coli O28, the serum concentrations of IL-12 were maintained higher in the samples collected at 7 and 14 days post-administration. No specific TNF-alpha profile could be established, depending on stimulated or non-stimulated probiotic culture, NVC fraction, or harvesting time. CONCLUSION: The obtained results demonstrate that non-viable fractions of probiotic bacteria, stimulated by other bacterial species, could induce immunostimulatory effects mediated by cytokines and act, therefore, as immunological adjuvants.
TI  - Inhibition of Bacillus cereus Strains by Antimicrobial Metabolites from Lactobacillus johnsonii CRL1647 and Enterococcus faecium SM21.
AB  - Bacillus cereus is an endospore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium able to cause foodborne diseases. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are known for their ability to synthesize organic acids and bacteriocins, but the potential of these compounds against B. cereus has been scarcely documented in food models. The present study has examined the effect of the metabolites produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii CRL1647 and Enterococcus faecium SM21 on the viability of select B. cereus strains. Furthermore, the effect of E. faecium SM21 metabolites against B. cereus strains has also been investigated on a rice food model. L. johnsonii CRL1647 produced 128 mmol/L of lactic acid, 38 mmol/L of acetic acid and 0.3 mmol/L of phenyl-lactic acid. These organic acids reduced the number of vegetative cells and spores of the B. cereus strains tested. However, the antagonistic effect disappeared at pH 6.5. On the other hand, E. faecium SM21 produced only lactic and acetic acid (24.5 and 12.2 mmol/L, respectively) and was able to inhibit both vegetative cells and spores of the B. cereus strains, at a final fermentation pH of 5.0 and at pH 6.5. This would indicate the action of other metabolites, different from organic acids, present in the cell-free supernatant. On cooked rice grains, the E. faecium SM21 bacteriocin(s) were tested against two B. cereus strains. Both of them were significantly affected within the first 4 h of contact; whereas B. cereus BAC1 cells recovered after 24 h, the effect on B. cereus 1 remained up to the end of the assay. The LAB studied may thus be considered to define future strategies for biological control of B. cereus.
TI  - Genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in Gram positive bacteria from organic foods.
AB  - Bacterial biocide resistance is becoming a matter of concern. In the present study, a collection of biocide-resistant, Gram-positive bacteria from organic foods (including 11 isolates from genus Bacillus, 25 from Enterococcus and 10 from Staphylococcus) were analyzed for genes associated to biocide resistance efflux pumps and antibiotic resistance. The only qac-genes detected were qacA/B (one Bacillus cereus isolate) and smr (one B. cereus and two Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolates). Efflux pump genes efrA and efrB genes were detected in Staphylococcus (60% of isolates), Bacillus (54.54%) and Enterococcus (24%); sugE was detected in Enterococcus (20%) and in one Bacillus licheniformis; mepA was detected in Staphylococcus (60%) and in one Enterococcus isolate (which also carried mdeA), and norE gene was detected only in one Enterococcus faecium and one S. saprophyticus isolate. An amplicon for acrB efflux pump was detected in all but one isolate. When minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined, it was found that the addition of reserpine reduced the MICs by eight fold for most of the biocides and isolates, corroborating the role of efflux pumps in biocide resistance. Erythromycin resistance gene ermB was detected in 90% of Bacillus isolates, and in one Staphylococcus, while ereA was detected only in one Bacillus and one Staphyloccus, and ereB only in one Staphylococcus. The ATP-dependent msrA gene (which confers resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and type B streptogramins) was detected in 60% of Bacillus isolates and in all staphylococci, which in addition carried msrB. The lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance gene lsa was detected in Staphylococcus (40%), Bacillus (27.27%) and Enterococcus (8%) isolates. The aminoglycoside resistance determinant aph (3_)-IIIa was detected in Staphylococcus (40%) and Bacillus (one isolate), aph(2_)-1d in Bacillus (27.27%) and Enterococcus (8%), aph(2_)-Ib in Bacillus (one isolate), and the bifunctional aac(6_)1e-aph(2_)-Ia in Staphylococcus (20%), Enterococcus (8%) and Bacillus (one isolate). Chloramphenicol resistance cat gene was detected in Enterococcus (8%) and Staphylococcus (20%), and blaZ only in Staphylococcus (20%). All other antibiotic or biocide resistance genes investigated were not detected in any isolate. Isolates carrying multiple biocide and antibiotic determinants were frequent among Bacillus (36.36%) and Staphylococcus (50%), but not Enterococcus. These results suggest that biocide and antibiotic determinants may be co-selected.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Analysis of microflora profile in Korean traditional nuruk.
AB  - A variety of nuruk were collected from various provinces in Korea, and their microflora profiles were analyzed at the species level. A total of 42 nuruk samples were collected and when the viable cell numbers in these nuruk were enumerated, the average cell numbers of bacteria, fungi, yeast, and lactic acid bacteria from all nuruk were 7.21, 7.91, 3.49, and 4.88 log CFU/10 g, respectively. There were no significant differences in viable cell numbers of bacteria or fungi according to regions collected. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis were the predominant bacterial strains in most samples. A significant portion, 13 out of 42 nuruk, contained foodborne pathogens such as B. cereus or Cronobacter sakazakii. There were various species of lactic acid bacteria such as Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus in nuruk. It was unexpectedly found that only 13 among the 42 nuruk samples contained Aspergillus oryzae, the representative saccharifying fungi in makgeolli, whereas a fungi Lichtheimia corymbifera was widely distributed in nuruk. It was also found that Pichia jadinii was the predominant yeast strain in most nuruk, but the representative alcohol fermentation strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was isolated from only 18 out of the 42 nuruk. These results suggested that a variety of species of fungi and yeast were distributed in nuruk and involved in the fermentation of makgeolli. In this study, a total of 64 bacterial species, 39 fugal species, and 15 yeast species were identified from nuruk. Among these strains, 37 bacterial species, 20 fungal species, and 8 yeast species were distributed less than 0.1%.
TI  - Technological properties and probiotic potential of Enterococcus faecium strains  isolated from cow milk.
AB  - AIM: To identify enterococci from the fermentation of milk for the production of  nono, an African fermented dairy product, to determine the technological properties for suitability as starter cultures and safety as probiotics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium CM4 and Enterococcus faecium 2CM1 were isolated from raw cow's milk. The strains were phenotypically and genotypically identified. Technological properties, safety investigations, in vitro adherence properties and antimicrobial characteristics were carried out. Strong acidification and tolerance to bile salts were recorded. The strains were bile salts hydrolytic positive and no haemolysis. There was no resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics. The strains exhibited adherence to human collagen type IV, human fibrinogen and fibronectin. The bacteriocins were active against Bacillus cereus DSM 2301, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes. Bacteriocins were stable at pH 4-9 and on treatment with lipase, catalase, alpha-amylase and pepsin, while their activity was lost on treatment with other proteases. The bacteriocins produced were heat stable at 100 degrees C for 10 min. The bacteriocin produced by the strains was identified as enterocin A. CONCLUSIONS: The E. faecium strains in this study exhibited probiotic activity, and the safety investigations indicate their suitability as good candidates for a starter culture fermentation process. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of bacteriocin-producing E. faecium strains as starter cultures in fermented foods is beneficial but, however, their safety investigations as probiotics must be greatly emphasized.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Modulation of virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains by Enterococcus faecium probiotic strain culture fractions.
AB  - The increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance drastically reduced the efficiency of conventional antibiotics and led to the reconsideration of the interspecies interactions in influencing bacterial virulence and response to therapy. The aim of the study was the investigation of the influence of the soluble and cellular fractions of Enterococcus (E.) faecium CMGB16 probiotic culture on the virulence and antibiotic resistance markers expression in clinical enteropathogenic Escherichia (E.) coli strains. The 7 clinical enteropathogenic E. coli strains, one standard E. coli ATCC 25,922 and one Bacillus (B.) cereus strains were cultivated in nutrient broth, aerobically at 37 degrees C, for 24 h. The E. faecium CMGB16 probiotic strain was cultivated in anaerobic conditions, at 37 degrees C in MRS (Man Rogosa Sharpe) broth, and co-cultivated with two pathogenic strains (B. cereus and E. coli O28) culture fractions (supernatant, washed sediment and heat-inactivated culture) for 6 h, at 37 degrees C. After co-cultivation, the soluble and cellular fractions of the probiotic strain cultivated in the presence of two pathogenic strains were separated by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min), heat-inactivated (15 min, 100 degrees C) and co-cultivated with the clinical enteropathogenic E. coli strains in McConkey broth, for 24 h, at 37 degrees C, in order to investigate the influence of the probiotic fractions on the adherence capacity and antibiotic susceptibility. All tested probiotic combinations influenced the adherence pattern of E. coli tested strains. The enteropathogenic E. coli strains susceptibility to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and quinolones was increased by all probiotic combinations and decreased for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This study demonstrates that the plurifactorial anti-infective action of probiotics is also due to the modulation of virulence factors and antibiotic susceptibility expression in E. coli pathogenic strains.
TI  - Bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in Manipur state of India.
AB  - Soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of Schizostachyum capitatum Munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in Manipur state of India. In this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), 16S rDNA sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This acidic starter (pH 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) together. The population distribution of dominant species were Bacillus subtilis 29.3%, Bacillus cereus 35.7%, Bacillus pumilus 2.6%, Lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, Lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, Carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, Enterococcus faecium 1.2% and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. Alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of B. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) region and ITS-RFLP profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in B. subtilis, five subgroups in B. cereus and three subgroups in L. brevis isolates. The most abundant B. subtilis subgroup IB.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during RAPD analysis. The molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of Bacillus and LAB distributed in most of the starter samples. These dominant strains of B. subtilis, L. brevis and L. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.
TI  - Rapid analysis of Gram-positive bacteria in water via membrane filtration coupled with nanoprobe-based MALDI-MS.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) is challenging when it is directly applied to identify bacteria in water. This study demonstrates a rapid, sensitive, and selective technique for detection of Gram-positive bacteria in water. It involves a combination of membrane filtration (MF) and vancomycin-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (VNPs) to selectively separate and concentrate Gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water, followed by rapid analysis of the isolates using whole-cell MALDI-MS. VNPs specifically recognize cells of Gram-positive bacteria, which serves as a basis for affinity capture of target Gram-positive bacteria. A two-step procedure of surface modification of bare magnetite nanoparticles was applied to synthesize VNPs. MF prior to VNP-based magnetic separation can effectively increase the enrichment factor and detection sensitivity and reduce time-consuming culture steps and the matrix effect for analysis of bacteria in MALDI-MS. The enrichment factor for the MF-VNP technique is about 6 x 10(4). A variety of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecium, were successfully analyzed from aqueous solutions and their mixtures with Gram-negative bacteria. The optimal conditions of the VNP/MALDI-MS technique, including selection of the MALDI matrix, the choice of cell-washing solution, and the VNP concentration, were also investigated. The capture efficiencies of Gram-positive bacteria with VNPs were 26.7-33.3%. The mass variations of characteristic peaks of the captured bacteria were within +/-5 Da, which indicated good reproducibility of the proposed technique. The technique was applied to detect Gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water with an analysis time of around 2 h. The detection limit for Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus was 5 x 10(2) cfu/ml for 2.0-l water samples.
TI  - Production, characterization, and antimicrobial activity of a bacteriocin from newly isolated Enterococcus faecium IJ-31.
AB  - This work aimed to isolate and characterize Enterococcus spp. from indigenous dairy products in Islamabad, Pakistan. By classical microbiological techniques, one strain from a butter sample was identified to be Enterococcus faecium, and we designated it E. faecium IJ-31. The precise identity of this strain was then established by determining the sequence of its 16S and 23S rRNA genes. The sequence homology searches revealed matches with a number of previously reported strains, such as E. faecium HN-N3 and HN-N29, both isolated from swine intestines in China. The newly isolated strain was tested for hemolysis and antibiotic sensitivity; it was nonhemolytic on sheep and human blood and sensitive to vancomycin. Consistent with its vancomycin sensitivity, repeated attempts to amplify the vancomycin resistance genes vanA and vanB failed. Similar attempts to amplify the virulence genes gelE, agg, and cyl also failed, suggesting the absence of these genes. In contrast, the enterocin-P gene, entP, readily amplified with primers based on the previously reported sequences, and the deduced sequence showed near identity with a number of reported sequences from E. faecium. Further, the 71-residue enterocin-P sequence from strain IJ-31 is only the second complete sequence reported. The enterocin was partially purified and tested for antibacterial activity. It showed potent inhibitory activity against many bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, a routinely used test strain. Further, the enterocin showed potent activity against Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. The enterocin retained antibacterial activity even following heating to 121 degrees Celsius for 15 min. Further, it also retained activity after exposure to pH values ranging from 4 to 10. However, proteinase K treatment rendered the peptide nonfunctional.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus Faecium Fair-E 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus faecium FAIR-E 198 against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by E. faecium FAIR-E 198 inhibited all L. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 AU mL(-1)). However, none of the B. cereus and S. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. The maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 AU mL(-1)) was observed in MRS broth, while the activity in milk was 100 AU mL(-1). In the co-cultivation test in milk, B. cereus K1-B041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log CFU mL(-1)) after 48 h. E. faecium reduced the initial L. monocytogenes Scott A population by 1 log CFU mL(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees C, However, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log CFU mL(-1) after 48 h. E. faecium did not influence the growth of S. aureus ATCC 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, Therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of E. faecium FAIR-E 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
TI  - Characterization of anti-Listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  - This work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. The two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing, as Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. Growth of Listeria innocua, L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and other LAB species were inhibited, although no inhibition of Gram-negative microorganisms was observed. Proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the inhibitors. The antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with NaCl, SDS, Triton X-100, Tween 20, Tween 80 and EDTA after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of pH and temperatures. Production of bacteriocin by E. faecium (bacALP7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 AU/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by P. pentosaceus ALP57 (bacALP57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 AU/ml. The bacteriocins did not kill L. monocytogenes ESB54 nor L. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. The partially purified bacteriocins, bacALP7 and bacALP57, were below 6.5 kDa in size as determined by Tricine-SDS gel electrophoresis. E. faecium and P. pentosaceus contained DNA fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin B and pediocin PA-1, respectively. Sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. To our knowledge, for the first time two LAB producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin PA-1 and enterocin B, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. The adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of L. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.
TI  - Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (PRPs) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for Qnr-like PRPs in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis in Escherichia coli DH10B. MIC values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and E. coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for PRPs. RESULTS: Amino acid identity of Qnr-like PRPs in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA1, QnrB1 and QnrS1 was in the range of 16% to 22%. Recombinant plasmids coding for Qnr-like PRPs conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/L for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/L), depending on the antimicrobial agent and PRP. The PRP from B. subtilis showed no protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: The PRPs analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in E. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in quinolone resistance of PRPs from different gram-positive species. These gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Impact of the probiotic bacteria Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (SF68) and Bacillus cereus var. toyoi NCIMB 40112 on the development of serum IgG and faecal IgA of sows and their piglets.
AB  - To examine the influence of two different probiotic bacteria on the humoral immune system of swine, two animal studies were carried out with sows and their litters. The sows' feed was supplemented with either Enterococcusfaecium NCIMB 10415 (SF68) or Bacillus cereus var. toyoi NCIMB 40112 beginning early in pregnancy. The total IgA content in the faeces as well as the total IgG concentration in the blood of the sows was recorded before and after weaning. The same parameters were determined in the blood and faeces of the piglets. In sows, only feed supplementation with B. cereus led to a clear increase in faecal IgA. Serum IgG levels were not significantly affected by any probiotic feeding in sows. In piglets, the group that was fed B. cereus showed significantly higher faecal IgA levels shortly before weaning, whereas in the E. faecium group, a significant decrease in IgA levels was observed one week after weaning. In both probiotic fed groups the post-weaning IgG levels were significantly decreased compared to the respective control groups. We conclude that B. cereus var. toyoi feed supplementation led to an increased intestinal IgA secretion both in sows and piglets. This effect could be related to a more successful mucosal defence which in turn led to a lower level in systemic IgG production in piglets after weaning.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Characteristics of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from dochi-isolated Enterococcus faecium D081821 and D081833.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) from two dochi-isolated Enterococcus faecium. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium D081821 and D081833 were isolated from dochi (a traditional fermented food in Taiwan) and found to produce BLIS with inhibitory activities against Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. Strains D081821 and D081833 showed different growth temperatures and their BLIS showed different sensitivities to heat, proteolytic enzymes, and antibacterial spectra. Both BLIS were collected, partially purified, and analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE showed that both partially purified BLIS were approximately 3.0 kDa in size. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that E. faecium D081821 and D081833 produce different BLIS with strong antibacterial actions against the tested pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results of this study suggest that two different BLIS from dochi-isolated lactic acid bacteria have potential for use as food preservatives.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Enterocin AS-48RJ: a variant of enterocin AS-48 chromosomally encoded by Enterococcus faecium RJ16 isolated from food.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenic strain RJ16 isolated from goat cheese has been identified as Enterococcusfaecium by species-specific PCR, DNA-rRNA hybridization and rDNA sequencing. Purified bacteriocin from strain RJ16 is a carboxypeptidase A-resistant peptide with a molecular mass (7125 Da) very close to the cyclic peptide enterocin AS-48. Bacteriocin from strain RJ16 and AS-48 show identical antibacterial spectra, although the former is slightly less active on strains of Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. Producer strains show cross-immunity. PCR amplification of total DNA from strain RJ16 with primers for the AS-48 structural gene and sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed an almost identical sequence (99.5%), except for a single mutation that predicts the change of Glu residue at position 20 of AS-48 to Val. Therefore, bacteriocin produced by E. faecium RJ16 should be considered a variant of AS-48, which we call AS-48RJ. PCR amplification revealed that strain RJ16 contains the complete as-48. gene cluster. Hybridization with probes for as-48 gene cluster revealed a chromosomal location of as-48 genes in strain RJ16, being the first example of a chromosomal location of this bacteriocin trait. Strain RJ16 produced enzymes of interest in food processing (esterase, esterase lipase and phytase activities), and did not decarboxylate amino acids precursors for biogenic amines. Strain RJ16 did not exhibit haemolytic or gelatinase activities, and PCR amplification revealed the lack of genes encoding for known virulence determinants (aggregation substance, collagen adhesin, enterococcal surface protein, endocarditis antigens, as well as haemolysin and gelatinase production). Strain RJ16 was resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC > 2 mgl(-1)) and levofloxacin (MIC > 4 mgl(-1)) and showed intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin and erythromycin, but was sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Altogether, results from this study suggest that this broad-spectrum bacteriocin-producing strain may have a potential use in food preservation.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Spectroscopic quantification of bacteria using artificial neural networks.
AB  - Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, in conjunction with artificial neural networks, has been used for identification and classification of selected foodborne pathogens. Five bacterial species (Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella boydii) and five Escherichia coli strains (O103, O55, O121, O30, O26) suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were enumerated to provide seven different concentrations ranging from 10(9) to 10(3) CFU/ ml. The trained artificial neural networks were then validated with an independent subset of samples and compared with the traditional plate count method. It was found that the concentration-based classification of the species was 100% correct and the strain-based classification was 90 to 100% accurate.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives II.
AB  - A series of new derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantaneethanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride, as well as 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride, appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-phenylalanyl)phthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-leucyl)-phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for these compounds against Bacillus cereus were 15 and 8 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ramoplanin (a novel lipoglycopeptide), vancomycin, and teicoplanin against gram-positive clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of ramoplanin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against Gram-positive organisms isolated from cancer patients were determined. Ramoplanin was the most active agent tested inhibiting all isolates at a concentration of < or = 0.5 mg/L. Although all isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin, their activities were surpassed by that of ramoplanin. The activity of teicoplanin was moderately better than that of vancomycin against Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and most streptococcal isolates, and was comparable to vancomycin for the remainder of the isolates tested.
TI  - Investigation of bacterial resistance to hatchery disinfectants.
AB  - Three commercial chicken hatcheries were sampled for environmental bacteria. Isolated bacteria were tested for resistance to commercial preparations of quaternary ammonia, phenolic, and glutaraldehyde liquid disinfectants. Bacterial isolates were exposed to several disinfectant dilutions bracketing the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer for 5-, 10-, and 15-min exposure periods before subculturing to broth medium. Approximately 8% of the isolates from two of three hatcheries were resistant to disinfectant concentrations at and above the manufacturers recommended dilution and time of exposure. Resistant bacteria included Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus badius, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Enterobacter agglomerans.
TI  - Two investigational glycylcyclines, DMG-DMDOT and DMG-MINO. Antimicrobial activity studies against gram-positive species.
AB  - DMG-DMDOT (CL-331,002 OR CL-331,928) and DMG-MINO (CL-329,998 or CL-344,677) are  two new semisynthetic tetracyclines called glycylcyclines, with a broad spectrum of activity and includes Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-positive cocci, JK diphtheroids, and Bacillus cereus. Potent activity was demonstrated against all Streptococcus spp. strains [minimum inhibitory concentrations] (MIC90S) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml) and staphylococci (oxacillin susceptible ans resistant; MIC90S 0.12-2 micrograms/ml). Both glycylcyclines (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml) were more potent than minocycline (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml) against Enterococcus faecium, many of which were vancomycin resistant (116 strains). Organisms with minocycline MICs at > or = 8 micrograms/ml (Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and pneumococci) had glycylcycline MIC results ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (e.g., apparent use against existing tetracycline-resistance phenotypes). Drugs in this class appear promising for therapy of infections caused by Gram-positive species now testing resistant to contemporary antimicrobial agents, and further development of compounds in this class is encouraged.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of 3 probiotics on experimental Escherichia coli enterotoxaemia in weaned piglets.
AB  - In this report the efficacy of 3 different probiotics (Bacillus cereus "toyoi", Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus faecium) was investigated. They were supplemented in the food of recently weaned piglets that were orally infected with E. coli O141 K85ab. Supplementation could not prevent mortality and clinical symptoms nor reduce the faecal excretion of hemolytic E. coli. The possible explanations for the unsatisfying results are various.
TI  - SURVEY OF THE BACTERIOCINES OF ENTEROCOCCI.
AB  - Brock, Thomas D. (Indiana University, Bloomington), Barbara Peacher, and Deborah  Pierson. A survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci. J. Bacteriol. 86:702-707. 1963.-A survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group D streptococci. On the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. Type 1 is produced by all Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. Type 2 is produced by some S. liquefaciens (S. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. Type 3 is produced by certain strains of both S. faecalis and S. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group D streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except Leuconostoc citrovorum. Type 4 is produced by certain S. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. Type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of S. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. The strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. No strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.
