TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. Oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. While the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. By using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. Staphylococcus aureus and A. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. They localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high numbers, and suppressed the growth of A. oris and S. mutants. Enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas E. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. In conclusion, it is possible for selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. Moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial RTX toxins allow acute ATP release from human erythrocytes directly through the toxin pore.
AB  - ATP is as an extracellular signaling molecule able to amplify the cell lysis inflicted by certain bacterial toxins including the two RTX toxins alpha-hemolysin (HlyA) from Escherichia coli and leukotoxin A (LtxA) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Inhibition of P2X receptors completely blocks the RTX toxin-induced hemolysis over a larger concentration range. It is, however, at present not known how the ATP that provides the amplification is released from the attacked cells. Here we show that both HlyA and LtxA trigger acute release of ATP from human erythrocytes that preceded and were not caused by cell lysis. This early ATP release did not occur via previously described ATP-release pathways in the erythrocyte. Both HlyA and LtxA were capable of triggering ATP release in the presence of the pannexin 1 blockers carbenoxolone and probenecid, and the HlyA-induced ATP release was found to be similar in erythrocytes from pannexin 1 wild type and knock-out mice. Moreover, the voltage-dependent anion channel antagonist TRO19622 had no effect on ATP release by either of the toxins. Finally, we showed that both HlyA and LtxA were able to release ATP from ATP-loaded lipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) vesicles devoid of any erythrocyte channels or transporters. Again we were able to show that this happened in a non-lytic fashion, using calcein-containing vesicles as controls. These data show that both toxins incorporate into lipid vesicles and allow ATP to be released. We suggest that both toxins cause acute ATP release by letting ATP pass the toxin pores in both human erythrocytes and artificial membranes.
TI  - Leukocyte production of inflammatory mediators is inhibited by the antioxidants phloretin, silymarin, hesperetin, and resveratrol.
AB  - Antioxidants possess significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. One such disorder is periodontitis characterised by an antimicrobial immune response, inflammation, and irreversible changes to the supporting structures of the teeth. Recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns is a crucial component of innate immunity to Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, as well as the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. In this study, we investigated the antioxidants Phloretin, Silymarin, Hesperetin, and Resveratrol to ascertain whether they altered the production of inflammatory mediators by innately-activated leukocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide purified from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and the production of cytokines, chemokines, and differentiation factors was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cytometric bead array, and RT-PCR. Significant inhibition of these factors was achieved upon treatment with Phloretin, Silymarin, Hesperetin, and Resveratrol. These data further characterise the potent anti-inflammatory properties of antioxidants. Their ability to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and differentiation factors by a heterogeneous population of leukocytes has clear implications for their therapeutic potential in vivo.
TI  - Sialic acid residues are essential for cell lysis mediated by leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Leukotoxin (LtxA) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is known to target and lyse beta2-integrin-expressing cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. LtxA is an important virulence factor that facilitates chronic inflammation and is strongly associated with a fast-progressing form of periodontitis caused by the JP2 clone of the bacterium. Here, we show that sialic acid residues are important for LtxA-induced cell lysis, regardless of whether the cell express beta2-integrin or not. Clearly, removal of sialic acid groups significantly reduces a beta2-integrin-specific LtxA-induced lysis. Moreover, sialic acid presented on alternative proteins, such as, for instance, on erythrocytes that do not express beta2-integrin, also makes the cells more sensitive to LtxA. The data also illustrate the importance of the negative charge in order for the sialic acid to associate LtxA with the membrane. Removal of sialic acid is in itself sufficient to significantly reduce the negative charge on the erythrocytes. Moreover, we found that on human erythrocytes there is a positive association between the sensitivity to LtxA and the amount of negative charge caused by sialic acid. Interestingly, these features are not shared by all RTX toxins, since alpha-hemolysin from Escherichia coli induced cell lysis of both beta2-integrin-expressing and nonexpressing cells and this lysis is independent of the presence of sialic acid residues. In conclusion, LtxA not only is cytotoxic to beta2-integrin-expressing cells but can potentially initiate cell lysis in all cells that present a sufficient density of sialic acid groups on their plasma membrane.
TI  - Differential transcriptional regulation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  lsrACDBFG and lsrRK operons by integration host factor protein.
AB  - We previously showed that the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lsrACDBFG and lsrRK operons are regulated by LsrR and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) and that proper regulation of the lsr locus is required for optimal biofilm growth by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Here, we identified sequences that reside immediately upstream from both the lsrA and lsrR start codons that closely resemble the consensus recognition sequence of Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) protein. A. actinomycetemcomitans IHFalpha and IHFbeta were expressed and purified as hexahistidine fusion proteins, and using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), the IHFalpha-IHFbeta protein complex was shown to bind to probes containing the putative IHF recognition sequences. In addition, single-copy chromosomal insertions of lsrR promoter-lacZ and lsrA promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusions in wild-type A. actinomycetemcomitans and DeltaihfA and DeltaihfB mutant strains showed that IHF differentially regulates the lsr locus and functions as a negative regulator of lsrRK and a positive regulator of lsrACDBFG. Deletion of ihfA or ihfB also reduced biofilm formation and altered biofilm architecture relative to the wild-type strain, and these phenotypes were partially complemented by a plasmid-borne copy of ihfA or ihfB. Finally, using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), two transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and two putative promoters were identified for lsrRK and three TSSs and putative promoters were identified for lsrACDBFG. The function of the two lsrRK promoters and the positive regulatory role of IHF in regulating lsrACDBFG expression were confirmed with a series of lacZ transcriptional fusion constructs. Together, our results highlight the complex transcriptional regulation of the lsrACDBFG and lsrRK operons and suggest that multiple promoters and the architecture of the lsrACDBFG-lsrRK intergenic region may control the expression of these operons.
TI  - Blue light kills Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans due to its endogenous photosensitizers.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to demonstrate that the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (AA) can be killed by irradiation with blue light derived from a LED light-curing unit due to its endogenous photosensitizers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Planktonic cultures of AA and Escherichia coli were irradiated with blue light from a bluephase(R) C8 light-curing unit with an emission peak at 460 nm, which is usually applied for polymerization of dental resins. A CFU-assay was performed for the analysis of viable bacteria after treatment. Moreover, bacterial cells were lysed and the lysed AA and E. coli were investigated for generation of singlet oxygen. Spectroscopic measurements of lysed AA and E. coli were performed and analyzed for characteristic absorption and emission peaks. RESULTS: A light dose of 150 J/cm(2) induced a reduction of >/=5 log10 steps of viable AA, whereas no effect of blue light was found against E. coli. Spectrally resolved measurements of singlet oxygen luminescence showed clearly that a singlet oxygen signal is generated from lysed AA upon excitation at 460 nm. Spectroscopic measurements of lysed AA exhibited characteristic absorption and emission peaks similar to those of known porphyrins and flavins. CONCLUSIONS: AA can be inactivated by irradiation with blue light only, without application of an exogenous photosensitizer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results encourage further studies on the potential use of these blue light-mediated auto-photosensitization processes in the treatment of periodontitis for the successful inactivation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - Pro-oxidative synergic bactericidal effect of NO: kinetics and inhibition by nitroxides.
AB  - NO plays diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes, occasionally  resulting in opposing effects, particularly in cells subjected to oxidative stress. NO mostly protects eukaryotes against oxidative injury, but was demonstrated to kill prokaryotes synergistically with H2O2. This could be a promising therapeutic avenue. However, recent conflicting findings were reported describing dramatic protective activity of NO. The previous studies of NO effects on prokaryotes applied a transient oxidative stress while arbitrarily checking the residual bacterial viability after 30 or 60min and ignoring the process kinetics. If NO-induced synergy and the oxidative stress are time-dependent, the elucidation of the cell killing kinetics is essential, particularly for survival curves exhibiting a "shoulder" sometimes reflecting sublethal damage as in the linear-quadratic survival models. We studied the kinetics of NO synergic effects on H2O2-induced killing of microbial pathogens. A synergic pro-oxidative activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive cells is demonstrated even at sub-muM/min flux of NO. For certain strains, the synergic effect progressively increased with the duration of cell exposure, and the linear-quadratic survival model best fit the observed survival data. In contrast to the failure of SOD to affect the bactericidal process, nitroxide SOD mimics abrogated the pro-oxidative synergy of NO/H2O2. These cell-permeative antioxidants, which hardly react with diamagnetic species and react neither with NO nor with H2O2, can detoxify redox-active transition metals and catalytically remove intracellular superoxide and nitrogen-derived reactive species such as (*)NO2 or peroxynitrite. The possible mechanism underlying the bactericidal NO synergy under oxidative stress and the potential therapeutic gain are discussed.
TI  - Identification of a novel bacterial outer membrane interleukin-1Beta-binding protein from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a gram-negative opportunistic oral pathogen. It is frequently associated with subgingival biofilms of both chronic and aggressive periodontitis, and the diseased sites of the periodontium exhibit increased levels of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin (IL)-1beta. Some bacterial species can alter their physiological properties as a result of sensing IL-1beta. We have recently shown that this cytokine localizes to the cytoplasm of A. actinomycetemcomitans in co-cultures with organotypic gingival mucosa. However, current knowledge about the mechanism underlying bacterial IL-1beta sensing is still limited. In this study, we characterized the interaction of A. actinomycetemcomitans total membrane protein with IL-1beta through electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The interacting protein, which we have designated bacterial interleukin receptor I (BilRI), was identified through mass spectrometry and was found to be Pasteurellaceae specific. Based on the results obtained using protein function prediction tools, this protein localizes to the outer membrane and contains a typical lipoprotein signal sequence. All six tested biofilm cultures of clinical A. actinomycetemcomitans strains expressed the protein according to phage display-derived antibody detection. Moreover, proteinase K treatment of whole A. actinomycetemcomitans cells eliminated BilRI forms that were outer membrane specific, as determined through immunoblotting. The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli in both the outer membrane-associated form and a soluble cytoplasmic form. When assessed using flow cytometry, the BilRI-overexpressing E. coli cells were observed to bind 2.5 times more biotinylated-IL-1beta than the control cells, as detected with avidin-FITC. Overexpression of BilRI did not cause binding of a biotinylated negative control protein. In a microplate assay, soluble BilRI bound to IL-1beta, but this binding was not specific, as a control protein for IL-1beta also interacted with BilRI. Our findings suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans expresses an IL-1beta-binding surface-exposed lipoprotein that may be part of the bacterial IL-1beta-sensing system.
TI  - A new functional site W115 in CdtA is critical for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a specific pathogen of localized aggressive periodontitis, produces a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that arrests eukaryotic cells irreversibly in G0/G1 or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Although structural studies show that the aromatic patch region of CdtA plays an important role in its biological activity, the functional sites of CdtA have not been firmly established. In this study, site-specific mutagenesis strategy was employed for cdtA point mutations construction so as to examine the contributions of individual amino acids to receptor binding and the biological activity of holotoxin. The binding ability was reduced in CdtA(Y181A)BC holotoxin and the biological function of CDT was not weaken in CdtA(Y105A)BC, CdtA(Y125A)BC, CdtA(F109A)BC and CdtA(S106N)BC holotoxin suggesting that these sites were not critical to CDT. But the binding activity and cell cycle arrest ability of holotoxin complexes were inhibited in CdtA(W115G)BC. And this site did not affect the holotoxin assembly by size exclusion chromatography. Therefore, W115 might be a critical site of CdtA binding ability. These findings suggest that the functional sites of CdtA are not only in the aromatic patch region. W115, the new functional site is critical for receptor binding and cell cycle arrest, which provides potential targets for pharmacological disruption of CDT activity.
TI  - [Different expression of cytokines induced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide in monocytes/macrophages from different organs of rabbits].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of cytokines induced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (Aa-LPS) in monocytes/macrophages from different organs of rabbits. METHODS: The peripheral mononuclear cells (Mo), alveolar macrophages (AM), peritoneal macrophages (PM) and Kupffer cells (KC) from five New Zealand rabbits were isolated respectively. Then the cells from different organs were stimulated with Escherichia coli (Ec)-LPS or Aa-LPS at the dose of 1 mg/L. After culture for 24 hours, the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)6, IL-1beta, IL-8 mRNA and protein were determined by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively. RESULTS: The monocytes/macrophages challenged by Ec-LPS or Aa-LPS expressed more cytokines both in mRNA and protein levels compared with the controls (P < 0.05). Among them, AM displayed the highest respond when encount with Aa-LPS, with the TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-8 mRNA relative levels were (0.4719 +/- 0.0171), (2.7895 +/- 0.0669), (5.1527 +/- 0.1190), (3.6785 +/- 0.1836) and the proteins concentrations were (82.2 +/- 5.4), (40.2 +/- 2.0), (50 308.3 +/- 445.0), (35 305.3 +/- 1480.9) ng/L respectively. And the inducibility of Aa-LPS was stronger than that of Ec-LPS (P < 0.05). Meanwhile the cells from different organs showed discrepant response when exposed to Aa-LPS (P < 0.05). The results showed their abilities to secrete cytokines were in the sequence of AM > Mo > KC > PM. CONCLUSIONS: Aa-LPS influenced the expression of cytokines in monocytes/macrophages from different organs of rabbits.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties and dentin bonding strength of magnesium phosphate cements.
AB  - The main objective of this work was to assess the antimicrobial properties and the dentin-bonding strength of novel magnesium phosphate cements (MPC). Three formulations of MPC, consisting of magnesium oxide and a phosphate salt, NH4H2PO4, NaH2PO4 or a mixture of both, were evaluated. As a result of the setting reaction, MPC transformed into either struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H2O) when NH4H2PO4 was used or an amorphous magnesium sodium phosphate when NaH2PO4 was used. The MPC had appropriate setting times for hard tissue applications, high early compressive strengths and higher strength of bonding to dentin than commercial mineral trioxide aggregate cement. Bacteriological studies were performed with fresh and aged cements against three bacterial strains, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (planktonic and in biofilm) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. These bacteria have been associated with infected implants, as well as other frequent hard tissue related infections. Extracts of different compositions of MPC had bactericidal or bacteriostatic properties against the three bacterial strains tested. This was associated mainly with a synergistic effect between the high osmolarity and alkaline pH of the MPC. These intrinsic antimicrobial properties make MPC preferential candidates for applications in dentistry, such as root fillers, pulp capping agents and cavity liners.
TI  - ygiW and qseBC are co-expressed in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and regulate biofilm growth.
AB  - The quorum-sensing Escherichia coli regulators B and C (QseBC) two-component system were previously shown to regulate biofilm growth of the oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and to be essential for virulence. In this study, we use RT-PCR to show that an open reading frame, ygiW, residing upstream of qseBC and encoding a hypothetical protein is co-expressed with qseBC. In addition, using a series of lacZ transcriptional fusion constructs and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), the promoter that drives expression of the ygiW-qseBC operon and the transcriptional start site was mapped to the 372 bp intergenic region upstream from ygiW. No internal promoters drive qseBC expression independently from ygiW. However, qseBC expression is attenuated by approximately ninefold by a putative attenuator stem-loop (DeltaG = -77.0 KJ/mol) that resides in the 137 bp intergenic region between ygiW and qseB. The QseB response regulator activates expression of the ygiW-qseBC operon and transcription from the ygiW promoter is drastically reduced in DeltaqseB and DeltaqseBC mutants of A. actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, transcriptional activity of the ygiW promoter is significantly reduced in a mutant expressing an in-frame deletion of qseC that lacks the sensor domain of QseC, suggesting that a periplasmic signal is required for QseB activation. Finally, a non-polar in-frame deletion in ygiW had little effect on biofilm depth but caused a significant increase in surface coverage relative to wild-type. Complementation of the mutant with a plasmid-borne copy of ygiW reduced surface coverage back to wild-type levels. Interestingly, deletion of the sensor domain of QseC or of the entire qseC open reading frame resulted in significant reductions in biofilm depth, biomass and surface coverage, indicating that the sensor domain is essential for optimal biofilm formation by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Thus, although ygiW and qseBC are co-expressed, they regulate biofilm growth by distinct mechanisms.
TI  - Mlc is a transcriptional activator with a key role in integrating cyclic AMP receptor protein and integration host factor regulation of leukotoxin RNA synthesis in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a periodontal pathogen, synthesizes leukotoxin (LtxA), a protein that helps the bacterium evade the host immune response. Transcription of the ltxA operon is induced during anaerobic growth. The cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) indirectly increases ltxA expression, but the intermediary regulator is unknown. Integration host factor (IHF) binds to and represses the leukotoxin promoter, but neither CRP nor IHF is responsible for the anaerobic induction of ltxA RNA synthesis. Thus, we have undertaken studies to identify other regulators of leukotoxin transcription and to demonstrate how these proteins work together to modulate leukotoxin synthesis. First, analyses of ltxA RNA expression from defined leukotoxin promoter mutations in the chromosome identify positions -69 to -35 as the key control region and indicate that an activator protein modulates leukotoxin transcription. We show that Mlc, which is a repressor in Escherichia coli, functions as a direct transcriptional activator in A. actinomycetemcomitans; an mlc deletion mutant reduces leukotoxin RNA synthesis, and recombinant Mlc protein binds specifically at the -68 to -40 region of the leukotoxin promoter. Furthermore, we show that CRP activates ltxA expression indirectly by increasing the levels of Mlc. Analyses of Deltamlc, Deltaihf, and Deltaihf Deltamlc strains demonstrate that Mlc can increase RNA polymerase (RNAP) activity directly and that IHF represses ltxA RNA synthesis mainly by blocking Mlc binding. Finally, a Deltaihf Deltamlc mutant still induces ltxA during anaerobic growth, indicating that there are additional factors involved in leukotoxin transcriptional regulation. A model for the coordinated regulation of leukotoxin transcription is presented.
TI  - Construction of new cloning, lacZ reporter and scarless-markerless suicide vectors for genetic studies in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - To elucidate the putative function of a gene, effective tools are required for genetic characterization that facilitate its inactivation, deletion or modification on the bacterial chromosome. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli/Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans shuttle vector pYGK was determined, allowing us to redesign and construct a new shuttle cloning vector, pJT4, and promoterless lacZ transcriptional/translational fusion plasmids, pJT3 and pJT5. Plasmids pJT4 and pJT5 contain the origin of replication necessary to maintain shuttle vector replication. In addition, a new suicide vector, pJT1, was constructed for the generation of scarless and markerless deletion mutations of genes in the oral pathogen A. actinomycetemcomitans. Plasmid pJT1 is a pUC-based suicide vector that is counter-selectable for sucrose sensitivity. This vector does not leave antibiotic markers or scars on the chromosome after gene deletion and thus provides the option to combine several mutations in the same genetic background. The effectiveness of pJT1 was demonstrated by the construction of A. actinomycetemcomitans isogenic qseB single deletion (DeltaqseB) mutant and lsrRK double deletion mutants (DeltalsrRK). These new vectors may offer alternatives for genetic studies in A. actinomycetemcomitans and other members of the HACEK (Haemophilus spp., A. actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae) group of Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - P2X receptor stimulation amplifies complement-induced haemolysis.
AB  - Activation of the complement system evokes cell damage by insertion of membrane attack complexes, which constitute the basis of the pathogenesis of various haemolytic disorders. Recently, we found that haemolysis caused by other types of membrane pore-forming proteins such as alpha-haemolysin (HlyA) from Escherichia coli, alpha-toxin from Staphylococcus aureus and leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans inflict their cytotoxic effects through P2 receptor activation. Here we show that similar to haemolysis induced by HlyA, leukotoxin and alpha-toxin, complement-induced haemolysis is amplified through ATP release and subsequent P2 receptor activation. Similar results were found both in murine, sensitised ovine and human erythrocytes, with either human plasma or guinea pig serum as complement donors. Non-selective P2 antagonists (PPADS and suramin) concentration-dependently inhibited complement-induced haemolysis. More specific P2 receptor antagonists imply that P2X1 and P2X7 are the main receptors involved in this response. Moreover, complement activation produces a sustained increase in [Ca(2+)]i, which initially triggers significant erythrocyte shrinkage, most likely mediated by KCa3.1-dependent K(+) efflux. These results indicate that complement, similar to HlyA and alpha-toxin, requires purinergic signalling for full haemolysis and that activation of erythrocyte volume regulation protracts the process. This finding points to several new pathways to interfere with haemolytic diseases and implies that P2 receptor antagonists potentially can be used to prevent intravascular haemolysis.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lsrACDBFG and lsrRK operons and their role in biofilm formation.
AB  - Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is required for biofilm formation and virulence of the oral  pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and we previously showed that lsrB codes for a receptor for AI-2. The lsrB gene is expressed as part of the lsrACDBFG operon, which is divergently transcribed from an adjacent lsrRK operon. In Escherichia coli, lsrRK encodes a repressor and AI-2 kinase that function to regulate lsrACDBFG. To determine if lsrRK controls lsrACDBFG expression and influences biofilm growth of A. actinomycetemcomitans, we first defined the promoters for each operon. Transcriptional reporter plasmids containing the 255-bp lsrACDBFG-lsrRK intergenic region (IGR) fused to lacZ showed that essential elements of lsrR promoter reside 89 to 255 bp upstream from the lsrR start codon. Two inverted repeat sequences that represent potential binding sites for LsrR and two sequences resembling the consensus cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) binding site were identified in this region. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), purified LsrR and CRP proteins were shown to bind probes containing these sequences. Surprisingly, the 255-bp IGR did not contain the lsrA promoter. Instead, a fragment encompassing nucleotides +1 to +159 of lsrA together with the 255-bp IGR was required to promote lsrA transcription. This suggests that a region within the lsrA coding sequence influences transcription, or alternatively that the start codon of A. actinomycetemcomitans lsrA has been incorrectly annotated. Transformation of DeltalsrR, DeltalsrK, DeltalsrRK, and Deltacrp deletion mutants with lacZ reporters containing the lsrA or lsrR promoter showed that LsrR negatively regulates and CRP positively regulates both lsrACDBFG and lsrRK. However, in contrast to what occurs in E. coli, deletion of lsrK had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the lsrA or lsrR promoters, suggesting that another kinase may be capable of phosphorylating AI-2 in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Finally, biofilm formation of the DeltalsrR, DeltalsrRK, and Deltacrp mutants was significantly reduced relative to that of the wild type, indicating that proper regulation of the lsr locus is required for optimal biofilm growth by A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Characterization of the secretion pathway of the collagen adhesin EmaA of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The extracellular matrix protein adhesin A (EmaA) surface antennae-like structures of the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are composed of three identical protein monomers. Recently, we have demonstrated that the protein is synthesized with an extended signal peptide of 56 amino acids necessary for membrane targeting and protein translocation. In this study, EmaA secretion was demonstrated to be reliant on a chaperone-dependent secretion pathway. Deletion of secB partially reduced but did not abolish the amount of EmaA in the membrane. This observation was attributed to an increase in the synthesis of DnaK in the DeltasecB strain. Overexpression of a DnaK substitution mutant (A174T), with diminished activity, in the DeltasecB strain further reduced the amount of EmaA in the membrane. Expression of dnaK A174T in the wild-type strain did not affect the amount of EmaA in the membrane when grown under optimal growth conditions at 37 degrees C. However, EmaA was found to be reduced when this strain was grown at heat-shock temperature. A chromosomal deletion of amino acids 16-39 of the EmaA extended signal peptide, transformed with either the wild-type or dnaK A174T-expressing plasmid, did not affect the amount of EmaA in the membrane. In addition, the level of EmaA in a DeltasecB/emaA(-) double mutant strain expressing EmaADelta16-39 was unchanged when grown at both temperatures. The data suggest that chaperones are required for the targeting of EmaA to the membrane and a specific region of the signal peptide is necessary for secretion under stress conditions.
TI  - Novel iron-regulated and Fur-regulated small regulatory RNAs in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Iron can regulate biofilm formation via non-coding small RNA (sRNA). To determine if iron-regulated sRNAs are involved in biofilm formation by the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, total RNA was isolated from bacteria cultured with iron supplementation or chelation. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated that the expression of four sRNA molecules (JA01-JA04) identified by bioinformatics was significantly upregulated in iron-limited medium compared with iron-rich medium. A DNA fragment encoding each sRNA promoter was able to titrate Escherichia coli ferric uptake regulator (Fur) from a Fur-repressible reporter fusion in an iron uptake regulator titration assay. Cell lysates containing recombinant AaFur shifted the mobility of sRNA-specific DNAs in a gel shift assay. Potential targets of these sRNAs, determined in silico, included genes involved in biofilm formation. The A. actinomycetemcomitans overexpressing JA03 sRNA maintained a rough phenotype on agar, but no longer adhered to uncoated polystyrene or glass, although biofilm determinant gene expression was only modestly decreased. In summary, these sRNAs have the ability to modulate biofilm formation, but their functional target genes remain to be confirmed.
TI  - Leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans causes shrinkage and P2X receptor-dependent lysis of human erythrocytes.
AB  - Leukotoxin (LtxA) is a virulence factor secreted by the bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which can cause localized aggressive periodontitis and endocarditis. LtxA belongs to the repeat-in-toxin (RTX) family of exotoxins of which other members inflict lysis by formation of membrane pores. Recently, we documented that the haemolytic process induced by another RTX toxin [alpha-haemolysin (HlyA) from Escherichia coli] requires P2X receptor activation and consists of sequential cell shrinkage and swelling. In contrast, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of LtxA-mediated haemolysis are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the effect of LtxA on erythrocyte volume and whether P2 receptors also play a part in LtxA-mediated haemolysis. We observed that LtxA initially decreases the cell size, followed by a gradual rise in volume until the cell finally lyses. Moreover, LtxA triggers phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in the erythrocyte membrane and both the shrinkage and the PS-exposure is preceded by increments in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Interestingly, LtxA-mediated haemolysis is significantly potentiated by ATP release and P2X receptor activation in human erythrocytes. Furthermore, the LtxA-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increase and following volume changes partially depend on P2 receptor activation. Theseobservations imply that intervention against local P2-mediated auto- and paracrine signalling may prevent LtxA-mediated cell damage.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides and nitric oxide production by neutrophils from periodontitis subjects.
AB  - Neutrophils play an important role in periodontitis by producing nitric oxide (NO) and antimicrobial peptides, molecules with microbicidal activity via oxygen-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. It is unknown whether variation in the production of antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37, human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3, and NO by neutrophils influences the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. We compared the production of these peptides and NO by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated neutrophils isolated from healthy subjects and from patients with periodontitis. Peripheral blood neutrophils were cultured with or without Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-LPS (Aa-LPS), Porphyromonas gingivalis-LPS (Pg-LPS) and Escherichia coli-LPS (Ec-LPS). qRT-PCR was used to determine quantities of HNP 1-3 and LL-37 mRNA in neutrophils. Amounts of HNP 1-3 and LL-37 proteins in the cell culture supernatants were also determined by ELISA. In addition, NO levels in neutrophil culture supernatants were quantitated by the Griess reaction. Neutrophils from periodontitis patients cultured with Aa-LPS, Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS expressed higher HNP 1-3 mRNA than neutrophils from healthy subjects. LL-37 mRNA expression was higher in neutrophils from patients stimulated with Aa-LPS. Neutrophils from periodontitis patients produced significantly higher LL-37 protein levels than neutrophils from healthy subjects when stimulated with Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS, but no difference was observed in HNP 1-3 production. Neutrophils from periodontitis patients cultured or not with Pg-LPS and Ec-LPS produced significantly lower NO levels than neutrophils from healthy subjects. The significant differences in the production of LL-37 and NO between neutrophils from healthy and periodontitis subjects indicate that production of these molecules might influence individual susceptibility to important periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Membrane fusion proteins of type I secretion system and tripartite efflux pumps share a binding motif for TolC in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The Hly translocator complex of Escherichia coli catalyzes type I secretion of the toxin hemolysin A (HlyA). In this complex, HlyB is an inner membrane ABC (ATP Binding Cassette)-type transporter, TolC is an outer membrane channel protein, and HlyD is a periplasmic adaptor anchored in the inner membrane that bridges HlyB to TolC. This tripartite organization is reminiscent of that of drug efflux systems such as AcrA-AcrB-TolC and MacA-MacB-TolC of E. coli. We have previously shown the crucial role of conserved residues located at the hairpin tip region of AcrA and MacA adaptors during assembly of their cognate systems. In this study, we investigated the role of the putative tip region of HlyD using HlyD mutants with single amino acid substitutions at the conserved positions. In vivo and in vitro data show that all mutations abolished HlyD binding to TolC and resulted in the absence of HlyA secretion. Together, our results suggest that, similarly to AcrA and MacA, HlyD interacts with TolC in a tip-to-tip manner. A general model in which these conserved interactions induce opening of TolC during drug efflux and type I secretion is discussed.
TI  - Mast cells act as phagocytes against the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence to date shows that mast cells play a critical role in immune defenses against infectious agents, but there have been no reports about involvement of these cells in eliminating periodontopathogens. In this study, the phagocytic ability of mast cells against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans compared with macrophages is evaluated. METHODS: In vitro phagocytic assays were conducted using murine mast cells and macrophages, incubated with A. actinomycetemcomitans, either opsonized or not, with different bacterial load ratios. After 1 hour, cells were stained with acridine orange and assessed by confocal laser-scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Phagocytic ability of murine mast cells against A. actinomycetemcomitans was confirmed. In addition, the percentage of mast cells with internalized bacteria was higher in the absence of opsonization than in the presence of opsonization. Both cell types showed significant phagocytic activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans. However, the percentage of mast cells with non-opsonized bacteria was higher than that of macrophages with opsonized bacteria in one of the ratios (1:10). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report about the participation of murine mast cells as phagocytes against A. actinomycetemcomitans, mainly in the absence of opsonization with human serum. Our results may indicate that mast cells act as professional phagocytes in the pathogenesis of biofilm-associated periodontal disease.
TI  - Production of a novel quercetin glycoside through metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Most flavonoids exist as sugar conjugates. Naturally occurring flavonoid sugar conjugates include glucose, galactose, glucuronide, rhamnose, xylose, and arabinose. These flavonoid glycosides have diverse physiological activities, depending on the type of sugar attached. To synthesize an unnatural flavonoid glycoside, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans gene tll (encoding dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase, which converts the endogenous nucleotide sugar dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-L-mannose to dTDP-6-deoxytalose) was introduced into Escherichia coli. In addition, nucleotide-sugar dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) were screened to find a UGT that could use dTDP-6-deoxytalose. Supplementation of this engineered strain of E. coli with quercetin resulted in the production of quercetin-3-O-(6-deoxytalose). To increase the production of quercetin 3-O-(6-deoxytalose) by increasing the supplement of dTDP-6-deoxytalose in E. coli, we engineered nucleotide biosynthetic genes of E. coli, such as galU (UTP-glucose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase), rffA (dTDP-4-oxo-6-deoxy-d-glucose transaminase), and/or rfbD (dTDP-4-dehydrorahmnose reductase). The engineered E. coli strain produced approximately 98 mg of quercetin 3-O-(6-deoxytalose)/liter, which is 7-fold more than that produced by the wild-type strain, and the by-products, quercetin 3-O-glucose and quercetin 3-O-rhamnose, were also significantly reduced.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide regulates bone sialoprotein gene transcription.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) is believed to be associated with aggressive periodontitis characterized by a rapid bone loss. A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has a similar structure to Escherichia coli LPS, and they are Toll-like receptor 4 agonists. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an early marker of osteoblast differentiation. To investigate the effects of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS on bone formation, we targeted BSP as a marker for osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. BSP mRNA levels were decreased by 0.1 microg/ml and increased by 0.01 microg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS at 6 h in osteoblast-like ROS17/2.8 cells. In transient transfection analyses, 0.1 microg/ml decreased and 0.01 microg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS increased luciferase activities of the construct (-116 to +60). Introduction of 2 bp mutations to the constructs showed that the effects of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS were mediated by a cAMP response element (CRE), a FGF2 response element (FRE), and a homeodomain protein-binding site (HOX). Tyrosine kinase, ERK1/2, and PI3-kinase/Akt participated in the effects of both 0.1 and 0.01 microg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS. The results of gel shift showed that 0.1 microg/ml decreased while 0.01 microg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS increased CRE-, FRE-, and HOX-binding protein complexes formation at 6 h, and revealed that 0.01 microg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS induced BSP transcription through CREB1, JunD, Fra2, c-Fos, Runx2, Dlx5, and Smad1 targeting those response elements. These studies therefore indicated that 0.1 microg/ml suppressed and 0.01 microg/ml A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS increased BSP gene transcription mediated through CRE, FRE, and HOX elements in the rat BSP gene promoter.
TI  - Specificity of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. Because of observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic LPS, the authors hypothesized that LL-37 had specificity to neutralize such LPS activity. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate the LPS-neutralizing activity of LL-37 to various periodontopathogenic LPS in interleukin-8 (IL-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. METHODS: Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) and gingival fibroblasts (GF) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. After cell confluence in 24-well plates, LPS (10 mug/mL) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without LL-37 (10 mug/mL). After 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in IL-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: All periodontopathogenic LPS statistically significantly induced IL-8 production in both PDLF and GF (P <0.01). After neutralization with LL-37, both PDLF and GF showed a statistically significant reduction in IL-8 production compared with LPS-treated groups without LL-37 (P <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in IL-8 production in PDLF appeared to be higher than in GF. In addition, the percentage of reduction in IL-8 production varied considerably according to each periodontopathogenic LPS. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic LPS-induced IL-8 production in both PDLF and GF. Its LPS-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic LPS and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within LPS between different genera.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the lactoperoxidase system combined with edible Laminaria hot-water extract as a source of halide ions.
AB  - Hot-water extracts prepared from nine out of 12 samples of dried edible Laminaria reduced the viable numbers of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Esherichia coli below the detection limit after incubation for 5 min when combined with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase, and glucose. Some extracts showed higher bactericidal activity and a higher OI(-) concentration in the assay mixture after ultrafiltration.
TI  - The extended signal peptide of the trimeric autotransporter EmaA of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans modulates secretion.
AB  - The extracellular matrix protein adhesin A (EmaA) of the Gram-negative bacterium  Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a fibrillar collagen adhesin belonging to the family of trimeric autotransporters. The protein forms antenna-like structures on the bacterial surface required for collagen adhesion. The 202-kDa protein monomers are proposed to be targeted and translocated across the inner membrane by a long signal peptide composed of 56 amino acids. The predicted signal peptide was functionally active in Escherichia coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans using truncated PhoA and Aae chimeric proteins, respectively. Mutations in the signal peptide were generated and characterized for PhoA activity in E. coli. A. actinomycetemcomitans strains expressing EmaA with the identical mutant signal peptides were assessed for cellular localization, surface expression, and collagen binding activity. All of the mutants impaired some aspect of EmaA structure or function. A signal peptide mutant that promoted alkaline phosphatase secretion did not allow any cell surface presentation of EmaA. A second mutant allowed for cell surface exposure but abolished protein function. A third mutant allowed for the normal localization and function of EmaA at 37 degrees C but impaired localization at elevated temperatures. Likewise, replacement of the long EmaA signal peptide with a typical signal peptide also impaired localization above 37 degrees C. The data suggest that the residues of the EmaA signal peptide are required for protein folding or assembly of this collagen adhesin.
TI  - Antigen-presenting cell marker expression and phagocytotic activity in periodontal ligament cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal ligament (PDL) cells are the main cellular constituents of the periodontium, maintain the integrity of the connective tissue, and impact pathology in periodontitis. The aim of this study was to analyze whether PDL cells recognize foreign particles and participate in the immune response to periodontal pathogens. METHODS: Expression of surface proteins characteristic of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (major histocompatibility complex [MHC] class II, CD40, CD80, CD86) was analyzed in PDL cells after challenge with the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-17A, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or with heat-killed Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmitted light microscopy, flow cytometry, and time-lapse microscopy were applied to analyze their phagocytotic capacity of collagen (carboxylate-modified microspheres), non-periodontal (Escherichia coli) and periodontal (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) pathogens. Furthermore, it was examined whether cytokine activation of PDL cells affects the phagocytosis of collagen or bacteria. RESULTS: PDL cells upregulated MHC class II after cytokine stimulation on transcriptional level, whereas co-stimulatory molecules characteristic of professional APCs were not induced. Analyses on protein level revealed that MHC class II was not constitutively expressed in all PDL cell lines used. PDL cells phagocytosed both collagen and bacteria via acidic vesicles, suggesting the formation of phagosomes. Phagocytosis could be partially inhibited by inhibitors of phagocytosis, i.e., dynasore and wortmannin. Pre-incubation with cytokines did not further enhance the phagocytosis rate of collagen or bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that PDL cells do not only represent bystanders in periodontal infections, but display non-professional APC characteristics, suggesting possible participation in immune reactions of the oral cavity.
TI  - RbsB (NTHI_0632) mediates quorum signal uptake in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain 86-028NP.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is a respiratory commensal and opportunistic pathogen, which persists within biofilms on airway mucosal surfaces. For many species, biofilm formation is impacted by quorum signalling. Our prior work shows that production of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) promotes biofilm development and persistence for NTHI 86-028NP. NTHI 86-028NP encodes an ABC transporter annotated as a ribose transport system that includes a protein (RbsB) with similarity to the Escherichia coli LsrB and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans RbsB proteins that bind AI-2. In this study, inactivation of rbsB significantly reduced uptake of AI-2 and the AI-2 precursor dihydroxypentanedione (DPD) by NTHI 86-028NP. Moreover, DPD uptake was not competitively inhibited by ribose or other pentose sugars. Transcript levels of rbsB increased in response to DPD and as bacteria approached stationary-phase growth. The NTHI 86-028NP rbsB mutant also formed biofilms with significantly reduced thickness and total biomass and reduced surface phosphorylcholine, similar to a luxS mutant. Infection studies revealed that loss of rbsB impaired bacterial persistence in the chinchilla middle ear, similar to our previous results with luxS mutants. Based on these data, we conclude that in NTHI 86-028NP, RbsB is a LuxS/AI-2 regulated protein that is required for uptake of and response to AI-2.
TI  - Diode laser activated indocyanine green selectively kills bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Commercially available photodynamic therapy for periodontal diseases utilizes methylene blue as a photosensitizer. Here we propose a novel photosensitizer dye, indocyanine green (ICG), because it can be readily activated by commercially available dental 810 nm diode lasers and has an established safety record as an intravascular agent in cardiac imaging and ophthalmologic photodynamic therapy. Therefore, we aim to characterize ICG uptake and killing of key periodontal pathogens to explore its potential as a periodontal photodynamic therapy agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested ICG uptake by spectroscopy in Porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, in addition to Escherichia coli DH5alpha and a human gingival epithelial cell line, HepG, in relation to ICG dose and exposure time. We then measured killing of bacteria by determining viable bacteria counts before and after exposure to ICG and 810 nm diode laser light (0-0.5 W output settings, 0-5 seconds). ICG was also applied to extracted, restored teeth, and the teeth inspected visually for staining after rinsing with saline. RESULTS: We found rapid and significant uptake of indocyanine green into P. gingivalis 381 and A. actinomycetemcomitans 67, compared to E. coli DH5alpha and HepG gingival cell line. This correlated with significant killing of strains 381 and 67 compared to E.coli, with less than 10% survival. ICG does not appear to stain tooth surfaces and materials except calculus. CONCLUSION: ICG combined with an 810 nm diode laser may be useful as a photodynamic adjunct for reduction of bacterial load in periodontal pockets.
TI  - Oral administration of prostaglandin E(2)-specific receptor 4 antagonist inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced osteoclastogenesis in rat periodontal tissue.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal pathogens is one of the main causes of alveolar bone destruction. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) produced by host cells after LPS stimulation may contribute to the bone destruction. PGE(2) regulates osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis via PGE-specific receptor 4 (EP4). We examined the effects of the PGE(2)-EP4 pathway on the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related factors and studied the inhibitory effect of orally administered EP4-specific antagonist (EP4A) on LPS-induced bone destruction compared to complete inhibition of endogenous PGE(2) by indomethacin (IND). METHODS: ST2 cells were treated with IND or EP4A and stimulated by LPS. The mRNA expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin in ST2 cells were examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. LPS-induced bone destruction was examined using a rat model for the periodontal tissue destruction with topically applied LPS. RESULTS: IND and EP4A inhibited the upregulation of TNF-alpha mRNA expression, and only EP4A inhibited IL-6 and RANKL mRNA expressions in ST2 cells with LPS stimulation. Topically applied LPS induced a two-phase increase in osteoclasts along the alveolar bone margin, peaking after 3 hours and 3 days. Oral administration of EP4A and IND downregulated the later phase increase of osteoclasts. However, the early phase of increase at 3 hours was upregulated in IND-treated rats but not in EP4A-treated rats. CONCLUSION: It appears that the PGE(2)-EP4 pathway has an important role in LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis, and the specific blocking of the PGE(2)-EP4 pathway by EP4A can effectively downregulate bone destruction caused by LPS without an unexpected increased number of osteoclasts.
TI  - A novel gene required for natural competence in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Natural competence is the ability of bacteria to take up extracellular DNA and incorporate it into their genomes. Some strains of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a critical periodontal pathogen, are naturally competent for transformation. However, information on natural competence genes is limited for this species. The aim of this study was to confirm the involvement of a novel gene identified near the fimbriae gene cluster in natural competence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The functions of putative open reading frames (ORFs), designated AA00863-AA00865, in the Oralgen project database for A. actinomycetemcomitans strain HK1651, have not been determined. Using naturally transformable A. actinomycetemcomitans strains D7S-1 and ATCC29523, we created deletion mutants of homologous genes of these ORFs. Natural competence in the study strains was determined using an agar-based transformation frequency assay. RESULTS: Mutation of the AA00865 homolog, which we named urpA in A. actinomycetemcomitans strain D7S-1, resulted in the loss of natural competence, whereas mutations of the AA00864 and AA00863 homologs, located downstream of urpA gene, did not. Similar results were also observed in the mutants of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC29523. Complementation of the deleted sequence in the urpA mutant restored natural competence. CONCLUSION: The urpA gene is a novel gene required for natural competence in A. actinomycetemcomitans and does not exhibit significant homology with any natural competence genes previously identified in other bacterial species.
TI  - [Analysis of the inhibitory capacity against bacterial growth of several materials of dental use. Preliminar].
AB  - Dental plaque is one of the reasons for odontogenic infection. Although multiple  bacteria are involved in these processes, A.actinomycetemcomitans and S.mutans are considered directly responsible for localized aggressive periodontitis and caries respectively. On the other hand, it seems clear that the oral flora utilizes especially not well polished surfaces or without bacteriastatic capacity in order to obtain better adhesion. Based on those facts we expect to prove the inhibitory capacity "in vitro" of some materials used for teeth restoration and for the cementation of accessories against one common bacterium in the human flora and two pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity. We prepared, following the manufacturer's instructions, 18 discs for each one of the materials used in the study (2 composites and 2 ionomeros of glass). 6 discs of each material are incubated with A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. mutans and E. coli. 3 of them are incubated directly on the discs and the other 3 are incubated previously in an artificial saliva for 24 days. From the results, should be highlighted that only one of the materials demonstrated inhibitory capacity against A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. coli. None of them demonstrated inhibitory capacity against S. mutans.
TI  - Modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  - Inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. The present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. In particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.
TI  - Broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition by Kingella kingae exopolysaccharide.
AB  - Cell-free extracts prepared from Kingella kingae colony biofilms were found to inhibit biofilm formation by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and K. kingae. The extracts evidently inhibited biofilm formation by modifying the physicochemical properties of the cell surface, the biofilm matrix, and the substrate. Chemical and biochemical analyses indicated that the biofilm inhibition activity in the K. kingae extract was due to polysaccharide. Structural analyses showed that the extract contained two major polysaccharides. One was a linear polysaccharide with the structure -->6)-alpha-d-GlcNAcp-(1-->5)-beta-d-OclAp-(2-->, which was identical to a capsular polysaccharide produced by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5. The second was a novel linear polysaccharide, designated PAM galactan, with the structure -->3)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->. Purified PAM galactan exhibited broad-spectrum biofilm inhibition activity. A cluster of three K. kingae genes encoding UDP-galactopyranose mutase (ugm) and two putative galactofuranosyl transferases was sufficient for the synthesis of PAM galactan in Escherichia coli. PAM galactan is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit antibiofilm activity. The biological roles and potential technological applications of these molecules remain unknown.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Omp29 is associated with bacterial entry to gingival epithelial cells by F-actin rearrangement.
AB  - The onset and progressive pathogenesis of periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by the entry of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) into periodontal tissue, especially gingival epithelium. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying such bacterial entry remains to be clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible role of Aa outer membrane protein 29 kD (Omp29), a homologue of E. coli OmpA, in promoting bacterial entry into gingival epithelial cells. To accomplish this, Omp29 expression vector was incorporated in an OmpA-deficient mutant of E. coli. Omp29(+)/OmpA(-) E. coli demonstrated 22-fold higher entry into human gingival epithelial line cells (OBA9) than Omp29(-)/OmpA(-) E. coli. While the entry of Aa and Omp29(+)/OmpA(-) E. coli into OBA9 cells were inhibited by anti-Omp29 antibody, their adherence to OBA9 cells was not inhibited. Stimulation of OBA9 cells with purified Omp29 increased the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a pivotal cell-signaling molecule that can up-regulate actin rearrangement. Furthermore, Omp29 increased the formation of F-actin in OBA9 cells. The internalization of Omp29-coated beads and the entry of Aa into OBA9 were partially inhibited by treatment with PI3-kinase inhibitor (Wortmannin) and Rho GTPases inhibitor (EDIN), both known to convey FAK-signaling to actin-rearrangement. These results suggest that Omp29 is associated with the entry of Aa into gingival epithelial cells by up-regulating F-actin rearrangement via the FAK signaling pathway.
TI  - Azithromycin may inhibit interleukin-8 through suppression of Rac1 and a nuclear  factor-kappa B pathway in KB cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that the 15-member macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) not only has antibacterial activity, but also results in the role of immunomodulator. Interleukin (IL)-8 is an important inflammatory mediator in periodontal disease. However, there have been no reports on the effects of AZM on IL-8 production from human oral epithelium. Therefore, we investigated the effects of AZM on IL-8 production in an oral epithelial cell line. METHODS: KB cells were stimulated by Escherichia coli or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without AZM. IL-8 mRNA and protein expression and production in response to LPS were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and Rac1, which is important for IL-8 expression, was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: IL-8 mRNA expression, IL-8 production, and NF-kappaB activation in LPS-stimulated KB cells were inhibited by the addition of AZM. LPS-induced Rac1 activation was also suppressed by AZM. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that AZM inhibits LPS-induced IL-8 production in an oral epithelial cell line, in part caused by the suppression of Rac1 and NF-kappaB activation. The use of AZM might provide possible benefits in periodontal therapy, with respect to both its antibacterial action and apparent anti-inflammatory effect.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Cytokine production by leukocytes of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome patients in whole  blood cultures.
AB  - Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) is characterised by aggressively progressive periodontitis combined with palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis. It is caused by "loss of function" mutations in the cathepsin C gene. The hypothesis behind this study is that PLS patients' polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) produce more proinflammatory cytokines to compensate for their reduced capacity to neutralize leukotoxin and to eliminate Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Production of more interleukin (IL)-8 would result in the attraction of more PMNs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytokine profile in PLS patients' blood cultures. Blood was sampled from eight PLS patients (one female) from six families (antiinfective therapy completed: six; edentulous: two) with confirmed cathepsin C mutations and deficient enzyme activity. Nine healthy males served as controls. Whole blood cultures were stimulated with highly pure lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli R515 and IL-1beta plus tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Thereafter, release of IL-1beta (stimulation: LPS and LPS plus adenosine triphosphate), IL-6, IL-8, interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10, and interferon (IFN)-gamma (stimulation: LPS, IL-1beta/TNFalpha) were detected by ELISA. Medians of cytokine release were, with the exception of IP-10, slightly higher for PLS than for controls' cultures. None of these differences reached statistical significance. Increased production of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, or IFNgamma as a significant means to compensate for diminished activity and stability of polymorphonuclear leukocyte-derived proteases could not be confirmed in this study. Cytokine profiles in blood cultures may not be used to identify PLS patients.
TI  - Topical application of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin induces cell cycle arrest in the rat gingival epithelium in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is one of the etiological pathogens implicated in the onset of periodontal disease. This pathogen produces cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that acts as a genotoxin to induce cell cycle arrest and cellular distension in cultured cell lines. Therefore, CDT is a possible virulence factor; however, the in vivo activity of CDT on periodontal tissue has not been explored. Here, CDT was topically applied into the rat molar gingival sulcus; and the periodontal tissue was histologically and immunohistochemically examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant purified A. actinomycetemcomitans CDT was applied to gingival sulcus of male Wistar rats and tissue samples were immunohistochemmically examined. RESULTS: One day after application, infiltration of neutrophils and dilation of blood vessels in the gingival connective tissue were found. At day three, desquamation and detachment of cells in the junctional epithelium was observed. This abrasion of junctional epithelium was not observed in rats treated with mutated CDT, in which a His274Ala mutation is present in the CdtB subunit. This indicates the tissue abrasion may be caused by the genotoxicity of CdtB. Expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for proliferating cells, was significantly suppressed using CDT treatment in the junctional epithelium and gingival epithelium. CONCLUSION: Using the rat model, these data suggest CDT intoxication induces cell cycle arrest and damage in periodontal epithelial cells in vivo.
TI  - Functional implications of an intermeshing cogwheel-like interaction between TolC and MacA in the action of macrolide-specific efflux pump MacAB-TolC.
AB  - Macrolide-specific efflux pump MacAB-TolC has been identified in diverse gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli. The inner membrane transporter MacB requires the outer membrane factor TolC and the periplasmic adaptor protein MacA to form a functional tripartite complex. In this study, we used a chimeric protein containing the tip region of the TolC alpha-barrel to investigate the role of the TolC alpha-barrel tip region with regard to its interaction with MacA. The chimeric protein formed a stable complex with MacA, and the complex formation was abolished by substitution at the functionally essential residues located at the MacA alpha-helical tip region. Electron microscopic study delineated that this complex was made by tip-to-tip interaction between the tip regions of the alpha-barrels of TolC and MacA, which correlated well with the TolC and MacA complex calculated by molecular dynamics. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the MacA hexamer interacts with TolC in a tip-to-tip manner, and implies the manner by which MacA induces opening of the TolC channel.
TI  - [Gene cloning of cdtB from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bioactivity test of the recombinant protein CdtB in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct the prokayotic expression vector pET-15b-cdtB containing  the cdtB gene from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and to test the bioactivity of this recombinant CdtB in vitro. METHODS: The toxic cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) subunit encoding gene cdtB was amplified by PCR. Through restriction endonuclease digestion, gene cdtB and vector pET-15b were ligated to form pET-15b-cdtB expression system which was transformed into competent cells Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Protein expression was induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside and examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. Supercoiled plasmid pET-32a DNA was incubated with purified recombinant CdtB protein in vitro to view any changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the plasmid pET-32a DNA band. RESULTS: PCR testing results of pET-15b-cdtB transformed cells demonstrated that all strains contained cdtB gene. The DNA sequence was blast with cdtB gene from GenBank and 99% homology was obtained. Both of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting confirmed that recombinant CdtB was obtained. After incubated with the purified recombinant CdtB in vitro, the supercoiled plasmid pET-32a DNA was observed relaxing by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis test. CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant plasmid pET-15b-cdtB was successfully constructed and the recombinant CdtB protein which has the DNaseI-like activity was obtained.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Analysis of immune responses to purified recombinant antigens of periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The accumulating knowledge about host-pathogen interactions in infectious diseases shows how the immune system interfaces with pathogens, and thus, helps us in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases and improving their treatment. Purified antigens are indispensable while investigating the immune response in both innate and acquired immunities. It is ideal to use native antigens purified from the host organisms in native conditions that sustain their biological activity completely. However, purification of native antigens, especially on a large scale, is technically difficult and generally time consuming. Purifying protein as a peptide-tagged fusion protein is an effective approach. Purification of a recombinant protein engineered to incorporate a polyhistidine tag at either the carboxyl or amino terminus is an established method, and it can be easily modified to obtain optimal results under different conditions. Heat-shock proteins were highly conserved during evolution and are highly homologous between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Their molecular mimicry might have roles in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. We successfully generated histidine-tagged recombinant heat-shock proteins from the periodontopathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The recombinant proteins allowed us to evaluate the immune response to these antigens in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Mapping the epithelial-cell-binding domain of the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans autotransporter adhesin Aae.
AB  - The Gram-negative periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) binds selectively to buccal epithelial cells (BECs) of human and Old World primates by means of the outer-membrane autotransporter protein Aae. We speculated that the exposed N-terminal portion of the passenger domain of Aae would mediate binding to BECs. By using a series of plasmids that express full-length or truncated Aae proteins in Escherichia coli, we found that the BEC-binding domain of Aae was located in the N-terminal surface-exposed region of the protein, specifically in the region spanning amino acids 201-284 just upstream of the repeat region within the passenger domain. Peptides corresponding to amino acids 201-221, 222-238 and 201-240 were synthesized and tested for their ability to reduce Aae-mediated binding to BECs based on results obtained with truncated Aae proteins expressed in E. coli. BEC-binding of E. coli expressing Aae was reduced by as much as 50 % by pre-treatment of BECs with a 40-mer peptide (201-240; P40). Aae was also shown to mediate binding to cultured human epithelial keratinocytes (TW2.6), OBA9 and TERT, and endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Pre-treatment of epithelial cells with P40 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in binding and reduced the binding of both full-length and truncated Aae proteins expressed in E. coli, as well as Aae expressed in Aa. Fluorescently labelled P40 peptides reacted in a dose-dependent manner with BEC receptors. We propose that these proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that peptides can be designed to interfere with Aa binding mediated by host-cell receptors specific for Aae adhesins.
TI  - Transcriptional activation of the tad type IVb pilus operon by PypB in Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Type IV pili are virulence factors in various bacteria and mediate, among other functions, the colonization of diverse surfaces. Various subclasses of type IV pili have been identified, but information on pilus expression, biogenesis, and the associated phenotypes is sparse for the genus Yersinia. We recently described the identification of PypB as a transcriptional regulator in Yersinia enterocolitica. Here we show that the pypB gene is associated with the tad locus, a genomic island that is widespread among bacterial and archaeal species. The genetic linkage of pypB with the tad locus is conserved throughout the yersiniae but is not found among other bacteria carrying the tad locus. We show that the genes of the tad locus form an operon in Y. enterocolitica that is controlled by PypB and that pypB is part of this operon. The tad genes encode functions necessary for the biogenesis of the Flp subfamily of type IVb pili initially described for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to mediate a tight-adherence phenotype. In Y. enterocolitica, the Flp pilin protein shows some peculiarities in its amino acid sequence that imply similarities as well as differences compared to typical motifs found in the Flp subtype of type IVb pili. Flp is expressed and processed after PypB overproduction, resulting in microcolony formation but not in increased adherence to biotic or abiotic surfaces. Our data describe the transcriptional regulation of the tad type IVb pilus operon by PypB in Y. enterocolitica but fail to show most previously described phenotypes associated with this type of pilus in other bacteria.
TI  - Communication: Antimicrobial Activity of SMAP28 with a Targeting Domain for Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. However, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. A 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. One such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached PQGPPQ, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the N-terminus of SMAP28 (peptide ZS37-37) or the C-terminus of SMAP28 (peptide ZS37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver SMAP28 to the surface of P. gingivalis. For Escherichia coli and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ZS37-37 was higher than the median of SMAP28 alone, although the median MIC of ZS37-38 was lower than that of SMAP28 alone. For P. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median MIC values. For S. aureus, the median MIC was higher for ZS37-37 and ZS37-38 compared to SMAP28 alone, particularly for ZS37-38. For Fusobacterium nucleatum, the median MIC values were equal for ZS37-37 and ZS37-38 and higher than the median MIC for SMAP28 alone. Attaching PQGPPQ to SMAP28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of ZS37-37 or ZS37-38 for P. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of ZS37-37 or ZS37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. This is an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the Naja atra cathelicidin and related small peptides.
AB  - We have identified an 11-residue pattern (KR(F/A)KKFFKK(L/P)K), which we have named the ATRA motif, within the sequence of the Chinese cobra (Naja atra) cathelicidin. A series of 11-residue peptides (ATRA-1, -2, -1A and -1P) were designed to probe the significance of the conserved residues within the ATRA motif, and their contributions to antimicrobial performance. The antimicrobial activities of the peptides were assessed against Escherichia coli K12 strain and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Y4. ATRA-1 and -1A, demonstrated potencies comparable to that of N. atra cathelicidin. Structural examination by circular dichroism of the four short peptides suggested the significance of specific amino acid positions within the motif by their contribution to helicity. The results of these studies indicate that short peptides derived from the repeated ATRA motif from the N. atra cathelicidin can demonstrate both low toxicity against host cells and high antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative bacteria used in this study. They constitute novel, effective antimicrobial peptides that are much shorter (and thus less expensive to produce) than the natural cathelicidins, and they may represent new templates for therapeutic drug development.
TI  - Autoinducer-2 and QseC control biofilm formation and in vivo virulence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Biofilm formation by the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is dependent upon autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-mediated quorum sensing. However, the components that link the detection of the AI-2 signal to downstream gene expression have not been determined. One potential regulator is the QseBC two-component system, which is part of the AI-2-dependent response pathway that controls biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Here we show that the expression of QseBC in A. actinomycetemcomitans is induced by AI-2 and that induction requires the AI-2 receptors, LsrB and/or RbsB. Additionally, inactivation of qseC resulted in reduced biofilm growth. Since the ability to grow in biofilms is essential for A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence, strains that were deficient in QseC or the AI-2 receptors were examined in an in vivo mouse model of periodontitis. The DeltaqseC mutant induced significantly less alveolar bone resorption than the wild-type strain (P < 0.02). Bone loss in animals infected with the DeltaqseC strain was similar to that in sham-infected animals. The DeltalsrB, DeltarbsB, and DeltalsrB DeltarbsB strains also induced significantly less alveolar bone resorption than the wild type (P < 0.03, P < 0.02, and P < 0.01, respectively). However, bone loss induced by a DeltaluxS strain was indistinguishable from that induced by the wild type, suggesting that AI-2 produced by indigenous microflora in the murine oral cavity may complement the DeltaluxS mutation. Together, these results suggest that the QseBC two-component system is part of the AI-2 regulon and may link the detection of AI-2 to the regulation of downstream cellular processes that are involved in biofilm formation and virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by  a diverse group of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their ability to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, CDTs are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. Despite the widespread distribution of CDTs among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. Here we demonstrate that CDTs from Haemophilus ducreyi, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in CDT binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. The absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four CDTs tested. Surprisingly, fucosylated N-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in CDT-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the CDTs tested. Finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in CDT binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of CDTs tested. The findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of CDT-host interactions.
TI  - Genetic variants associated with neutrophil function in aggressive periodontitis  and healthy controls.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms that influence neutrophil function were proposed as possible risk factors for aggressive periodontitis (AgP). The aim of this study is to test whether a clinical diagnosis and specific genetic variants are associated with neutrophil activity in subjects with AgP and healthy subjects. METHODS: This study describes the results of neutrophil analyses performed in 40 subjects (20 subjects with AgP and 20 healthy control subjects). Neutrophils were extracted from peripheral blood and analyzed in a masked manner for phagocytosis and oxidative burst by flow cytometry in response to Escherichia coli, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped for the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate p22 phagocytic oxidase subunit (p22(phox)) cytochrome b alpha gene (CYBA) C242T, crystallizable gamma fragment (Fcgamma)IIa H/R, and FcgammaIIIb neutrophil antigen (NA)1/NA2 polymorphisms. RESULTS: Analyses in pairs of white subjects (n = 24) revealed that patients with AgP exhibited a higher oxidative burst in response to E. coli (P = 0.002) and P. gingivalis (P = 0.002) compared to healthy control subjects. The p22(phox) CYBA 242 T allele was associated with an oxidative burst in response to the challenge by two strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans (P = 0.018 and P = 0.046). The FcgammaIIa polymorphism was associated with the phagocytic index of E. coli (P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: This study confirms previous reports of a higher oxidative burst associated with AgP and presented preliminary evidence that genetic factors may influence neutrophil function in patients with AgP and healthy individuals.
TI  - N-terminal region of Mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin serves as a mitochondrial  targeting signal in mammalian cells.
AB  - Mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin (LktA) is a member of the RTX toxin family that specifically kills ruminant leukocytes. Previous studies have shown that LktA induces apoptosis in susceptible cells via a caspase-9-dependent pathway that involves binding of LktA to mitochondria. In this study, using the bioinformatics tool MitoProt II we identified an N-terminal amino acid sequence of LktA that represents a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS). We show that expression of this sequence, as a GFP fusion protein within mammalian cells, directs GFP to mitochondria. By immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that LktA interacts with the Tom22 and Tom40 components of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM), which suggests that import of this toxin into mitochondria involves a classical import pathway for endogenous proteins. We also analysed the amino acid sequences of other RTX toxins and found a MTS in the N-terminal region of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae ApxII and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli EhxA, but not in A. pleuropneumoniae ApxI, ApxIII, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans LtxA or the haemolysin (HlyA) from uropathogenic strains of E. coli. These findings provide a new evidence for the importance of the N-terminal region in addressing certain RTX toxins to mitochondria.
TI  - Recombinant expression and redox properties of triheme c membrane-bound quinol peroxidase.
AB  - The qpo gene of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans encodes a triheme c-containing membrane-bound enzyme, quinol peroxidase (QPO) that catalyzes peroxidation reaction in the respiratory chain and uses quinol as the physiological electron donor. The QPO of A. actinomycetemcomitans is the only characterized QPO, but homologues of the qpo gene are widely distributed among many gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophils ducreii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli. One-third of the amino acid sequence of QPO from the N-terminal end is unique, whereas two-thirds of the sequence from the C-terminal end exhibits high homology with the sequence of the diheme bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase. In order to obtain sufficient protein for biophysical studies, the present study aimed to overproduce recombinant QPO (rQPO) from A. actinomycetemcomitans in E. coli. Coexpression of qpo with E. coli cytochrome c maturation (ccm) genes resulted in the expression of an active QPO with a high yield. Using purified rQPO, we determined the midpoint reduction potentials of the three heme molecules.
TI  - Congo red-binding protein in rough-phenotype Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is amyloid-like fiber.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a pathogen associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and extra-oral infections. Fresh isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans are fimbriated, forming small, rough-phenotype colonies on agar plates and also form biofilms. Recently, it has been reported that amyloid fibers are abundant in natural biofilms, and Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. produce amyloid fibers that contribute to biofilm formation. This has yet to be reported, however, in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Amyloid binds the Congo red (CR) dye. In this study, therefore, we investigated amyloid formation in A. actinomycetemcomitans using a detection of CR-binding colonies on CR agar plates and CR-binding assay. All rough-phenotype strains formed dark red colonies and smooth-phenotype strains formed white or opaque red colonies on CR agar plates. Compared with smooth-phenotype strains, rough-phenotype strains showed higher CR-binding activity. CR-binding of rough-phenotype strain AKR was not affected by protease digestion or heating, whereas smooth-phenotype strain 29523 showed a marked reduction in CR-binding after both types of treatment. AKR showed amyloid-positive staining with CR to produce yellow green birefringence under polarized light, whereas 29523 showed amyloid-negative staining. These findings indicate that the CR-binding component of rough-phenotype A. actinomycetemcomitans is an amyloid-like fiber.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of galectin-3 on the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans endotoxin in splenocytes derived from mice.
AB  - Galectins, a family of animal lectins, are involved not only in development and differentiation but also in immunoregulation and host-pathogen interactions. Galectin-3 interacts with lipopolysaccharides in gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella minnesota and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The present study investigated whether galectin-3 inhibited the cytokine-inducing activity of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides using splenocytes derived from mice of different ages. Lipopolysaccharides were extracted from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, and then purified. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis revealed that galectin-3 adhered to A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides, but not to the lipopolysaccharides of P. gingivalis. Splenocytes were prepared from 1- or 7-month-old C57BL/6 mice. Either A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharides (200 ng mL(-1)) alone or lipopolysaccharides and murine galectin-3 (10 microg mL(-1)) were added to culture solutions, and the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) from splenocytes was measured by ELISA after a 17-h incubation. In all mice tested, A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide stimulation significantly increased the production of IL-6 and IFNgamma (P<0.01). Murine galectin-3 suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production in the splenocytes of the 1-month-old mice (P<0.02 for IL-6; P<0.05 for IFNgamma), but not in the splenocytes of the 7-month-old mice. This suggests that responses change with age.
TI  - A quinol peroxidase inhibitor prevents secretion of a leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Quinol peroxidase (QPO) catalyzes peroxidase activity using quinol in the respiratory chain as a substrate. Quinol peroxidase is essential for the secretion of leukotoxin (LtxA), which destroys leukocytes and erythrocytes in humans and is one of the major virulence factors of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis. In the present study, we aimed to find a highly potent QPO inhibitor to attenuate the virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For screening of QPO inhibitors, QPO activity was measured kinetically by SpectraMax Plus with 96-well UV plates. Three hundred compounds in the Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences Chemical Library were screened. Secretion of LtxA in the culture supernatant was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) cells from the culture supernatant was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion test. RESULTS: The present study characterized ascofuranone as a highly potent inhibitor of QPO (K(i) = 9.557 +/- 0.865 nm). Ascofuranone inhibited secretion of LtxA by A. actinomycetemcomitans in a dose-dependent manner, making A. actinomycetemcomitans less pathogenic to HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Quinol peroxidase inhibitors are promising candidates as alternative drugs for the treatment and prevention of the onset of localized aggressive periodontitis. Using ascofuranone as a seed compound, further study of QPO inhibitors could provide novel chemotherapeutic strategies for controlling localized aggressive periodontitis.
TI  - Enhanced expression of engineered ACA-less beta-1, 6-N-acetylglucosaminidase (dispersin B) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - beta-1,6-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (dispersin B), which cleaves poly-ss-(1,6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine, is encoded by dspB of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. To enhance the production of dispersin B, we engineered dspB to transcribe mRNAs devoid of the trinucleotide ACA. Transcription and translation levels of ACA-less and wild-type dspB expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) under T5 and T7 promoters were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and protein quantification, respectively. The ACA-less dspB mRNA level was significantly higher (P < 0.01) and produced 77.6 and 34.9% more dispersin B than wild-type dspB expressed under T7 and T5 promoters, respectively. Dispersin B expression under T7 promoter caused a 98-99.5% drop in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) mRNA level, which was not observed with T5 promoter. Fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with dispersin B allowed rapid quantification of dispersin B production by measuring fluorescence intensity in culture broth. Although the cultures containing 0.1% glucose showed sustained increase in dispersin B-GFP production until 12 h, no significant increase in dispersin B activity was observed beyond 4 and 6 h after induction when expressed under T7 and T5 promoters, respectively. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ACA-less mRNA and the advantage of GFP tagging for enhanced dispersin B production and quantification, which could be adapted for improving the production of other commercially important proteins in E. coli.
TI  - Human gingival fibroblasts release high-mobility group box-1 protein through active and passive pathways.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The nuclear protein high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) acts as a late mediator of inflammation when secreted in the extracellular milieu. In this study, we examined the effect of lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens and apoptotic and necrotic cell death on HMGB1 production in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). METHODS: HGF from healthy periodontal tissue were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Escherichia coli. We also initiated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths in HGF. The HMGB1 released in the supernatants from stimulated or dying cells was measured. Immunocytochemical staining against HMGB1 was performed in LPS-stimulated HGF. RESULTS: A significantly higher amount of HMGB1 was detected from necrotic and apoptotic HGF. LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and E. coli significantly induced the production of HMGB1 in a time-dependent manner. After 6 h of LPS stimulation, HMGB1 was present in the cytoplasm of cells whereas its location was mainly nuclear after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: LPS from two major periodontal pathogens, A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis, induced HMGB1 secretion from HGF. Apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths resulted in the enhancement of HMGB1. Our results suggest that HGF can be a source of HMGB1 by both active secretion and passive release, and that HMGB1 from HGF may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction.
TI  - Role of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione catabolism.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our previous studies demonstrated that three enzymes, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), cysteinylglycinase (CGase) and cystalysin, are required for the catabolism of glutathione to produce hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) in Treponema denticola. In this study, we examined glutathione catabolism in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. METHODS: The GGT and CGase of A. actinomycetemcomitans were determined by biological methods and GGT was characterized using a molecular biological approach. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans showed GGT and CGase activity, but could not produce H(2)S from glutathione. The addition of recombinant T. denticola cystalysin, an l-cysteine desulfhydrase, to whole cells of A. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in the production of H(2)S from glutathione. Subsequently, we cloned A. actinomycetemcomitans GGT gene (ggt) and overexpressed the 63 kDa GGT protein. The recombinant A. actinomycetemcomitans GGT was purified and identified. The K(cat)/K(m) of the recombinant GGT from N-gamma-l-glutamyl-4-nitroaniline as substrate was 31/microm/min. The activity of GGT was optimum at pH 6.9-7.1 and enhanced by thiol-containing compounds. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that A. actinomycetemcomitans had GGT and CGase activities and that the GGT was characterized. The possible role of A. actinomycetemcomitans in glutathione metabolism and H(2)S production from oral bacteria was discussed.
TI  - Ozonated water improves lipopolysaccharide-induced responses of an odontoblast-like cell line.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is important to develop an antimicrobial agent without any damage on dental pulp. In the present study, we examined whether pretreatment of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) with ozonated water (O(3)aq) improves LPS-induced responses of rat odontoblastic cell line, KN-3. METHODS: After the pretreatment of LPS with O(3)aq, effects of LPS and O(3)aq-treated LPS on cell viability; calcification ability; expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha); and activation of p38 of KN-3 cells were examined. RESULTS: The formation of mineralized nodules by KN-3 cells was suppressed by LPS, whereas that suppression was inhibited by the pretreatment of LPS with ozonated water. We also found that LPS-induced expression of COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and p38 activation were markedly suppressed when LPS was pretreated with ozonated water. Furthermore, expression of COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha by LPS were mainly induced through p38 activation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that odontoblastic cells exhibit inflammatory responses against LPS and that ozonated water has the ability to improve LPS-induced inflammatory responses and suppression of odontoblastic properties of KN-3 cells through direct inhibition of LPS.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Crystal structure of the periplasmic component of a tripartite macrolide-specific efflux pump.
AB  - In Gram-negative bacteria, type I protein secretion systems and tripartite drug efflux pumps have a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) as an essential component. MFPs bridge the outer membrane factor and an inner membrane transporter, although the oligomeric state of MFPs remains unclear. The most characterized MFP AcrA connects the outer membrane factor TolC and the resistance-nodulation-division-type efflux transporter AcrB, which is a major multidrug efflux pump in Escherichia coli. MacA is the periplasmic MFP in the MacAB-TolC pump, where MacB was characterized as a macrolide-specific ATP-binding-cassette-type efflux transporter. Here, we report the crystal structure of E. coli MacA and the experimentally phased map of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans MacA, which reveal a domain orientation of MacA different from that of AcrA. Notably, a hexameric assembly of MacA was found in both crystals, exhibiting a funnel-like structure with a central channel and a conical mouth. The hexameric MacA assembly was further confirmed by electron microscopy and functional studies in vitro and in vivo. The hexameric structure of MacA provides insight into the oligomeric state in the functional complex of the drug efflux pump and type I secretion system.
TI  - Modeling and biochemical analysis of the activity of antibiofilm agent Dispersin  B.
AB  - Bacteria in a biofilm are enmeshed in a self-synthesized extracellular polysaccharide matrix (PGA), which is a linear polymer of beta(1,6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. Dispersin B (DspB), a soluble glycoside hydrolase produced by the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans degrades PGA. The enzyme DspB is an alpha/beta TIM-barrel protein and belongs to family 20 glycosyl hydrolases members. The enzyme activity of DspB with regard to its substrate specificity towards beta(1,6)-linked GlcNAc polymers and its endo/exo character was investigated through ligand docking and the hydrolysis of synthetic oligosaccharides. Ligand docking analysis suggested that beta(1,6)-linked GlcNAc oligosaccharide bound to the active site better that beta(1,4)-linked GlcNAc oligosaccharide. Our combined results indicate that DspB is an exo-acting enzyme that hydrolyzes beta(1,6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligomers.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis Biofilms: Functional Molecules, Relation to Virulence, and Vaccine Potential.
AB  - Medical device-associated infections, most frequently caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, are of increasing importance in modern medicine. The formation of adherent, multilayered bacterial biofilms is crucial in the pathogenesis of these infections. Polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), a homoglycan of beta-1,6-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D: -glucopyranosyl residues, of which about 15% are non-N-acetylated, is central to biofilm accumulation in staphylococci. It transpires that polysaccharides - structurally very similar to PIA - are also key to biofilm formation in a number of other organisms including the important human pathogens Escherichia coli, Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Yersinia pestis, and Bordetella spp. Apparently, synthesis of PIA and related polysaccharides is a general feature important for biofilm formation in diverse bacterial genera. Current knowledge about the structure and biosynthesis of PIA and related polysaccharides is reviewed. Additionally, information on their role in pathogenesis of biomaterial-related and other type of infections and the potential use of PIA and related compounds for prevention of infection is evaluated.
TI  - Proinflammatory effect in whole blood by free soluble bacterial components released from planktonic and biofilm cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an oral bacterium associated with aggressive forms of periodontitis. Increasing evidence points to a link between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases, however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigated the pathogenic potential of free-soluble surface material, released from live planktonic and biofilm A. actinomycetemcomitans cells. RESULTS: By employing an ex vivo insert model (filter pore size 20 nm) we demonstrated that the A. actinomycetemcomitans strain D7S and its derivatives, in both planktonic and in biofilm life-form, released free-soluble surface material independent of outer membrane vesicles. This material clearly enhanced the production of several proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1 beta) in human whole blood, as evidenced by using a cytokine antibody array and dissociation-enhanced-lanthanide-fluorescent-immunoassay. In agreement with this, quantitative real-time PCR indicated a concomitant increase in transcription of each of these cytokine genes. Experiments in which the LPS activity was blocked with polymyxin B showed that the stimulatory effect was only partly LPS-dependent, suggesting the involvement of additional free-soluble factors. Consistent with this, MALDI-TOF-MS and immunoblotting revealed release of GroEL-like protein in free-soluble form. Conversely, the immunomodulatory toxins, cytolethal distending toxin and leukotoxin, and peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein, appeared to be less important, as evidenced by studying strain D7S cdt/ltx double, and pal single mutants. In addition to A. actinomycetemcomitans a non-oral species, Escherichia coli strain IHE3034, tested in the same ex vivo model also released free-soluble surface material with proinflammatory activity. CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans, grown in biofilm and planktonic form, releases free-soluble surface material independent of outer membrane vesicles, which induces proinflammatory responses in human whole blood. Our findings therefore suggest that release of surface components from live bacterial cells could constitute a mechanism for systemic stimulation and be of particular importance in chronic localized infections, such as periodontitis.
TI  - Inhibition of interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide production in endotoxin-activated macrophages by cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a DNA-targeting agent produced by certain pathogenic gram-negative bacteria such as the periodontopathogenic organism Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. CDT targets lymphocytes and other cells causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, impairing the host immune response and contributing to the persistence of infections caused by this microorganism. In this study we explored the effects of CDT on the innate immune response, by investigating how it affects production of nitric oxide (NO) by macrophages. METHODS: Murine peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with Escherichia coli sonicates and NO production was measured in the presence or not of active CDT. RESULTS: We observed that CDT promptly and significantly inhibited NO production by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition is directed towards interferon-gamma-dependent pathways and is not mediated by either interleukin-4 or interleukin-10. CONCLUSION: This mechanism may constitute an important aspect of the immunosuppression mediated by CDT and may have potential clinical implications in A. actinomycetemcomitans infections.
TI  - Naringenin has anti-inflammatory properties in macrophage and ex vivo human whole-blood models.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of bacterial etiology, affecting tooth-supporting tissues. The host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens, notably the high and continuous production of cytokines, is considered a major factor causing the local tissue destruction observed in periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of naringenin, a major flavanone in grapefruits and tomatoes, on the lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by host cells, using two different models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effect of naringenin was characterized using macrophages stimulated with the lipopolysaccharide of either Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli and using whole blood stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide, in the presence or absence of naringenin. Lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by macrophages and whole-blood samples treated with naringenin were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Changes in the phosphorylation states of macrophage kinases induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide and naringenin were characterized by immunoblot screening. RESULTS: Our results clearly indicated that naringenin is a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response induced by lipopolysaccharide in both macrophages and in whole blood. Naringenin markedly inhibited the phosphorylation on serines 63 and 73 of Jun proto-oncogene-encoded AP-1 transcription factor in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. CONCLUSION: The results from the present study suggest that naringenin holds promise as a therapeutic agent for treating inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis.
TI  - The anti-endotoxic effects of the KSL-W decapeptide on Escherichia coli O55:B5 and various oral lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the KSL-W decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled KSL-W to detect adsorbed Escherichia coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. A commercially available recombinant Factor C lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after KSL-W exposure to E. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. RESULTS: Lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using E. coli O55:B5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microM) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microM) for the KSL-W peptide when compared with its analog control. Significant inhibition of E-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of KSL-W with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. Recombinant Factor C enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microM. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the KSL-W decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of MacA from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Periplasmic membrane-fusion proteins (MFPs) are an essential component of the multidrug efflux pump in Gram-negative bacteria. They play a crucial role in bridging the outer membrane porin TolC and two distinct types of inner membrane transporters. The MFP MacA bridges the inner membrane ABC-type multidrug transporter MacB and the outer membrane porin TolC. MacA from the pathogenic bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was expressed in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3) and the recombinant protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity, Q anion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. The purified MacA protein was crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. A MAD diffraction data set was collected to a resolution of 3.0 A at 100 K. The crystal belongs to space group P622, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 109.2, c = 255.4 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees , and contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide stimulates collagen phagocytosis by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Collagen phagocytosis by fibroblasts is involved in the intracellular pathway related to collagen breakdown in soft connective tissues. The possible role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in regulating this fibroblast function has not been elucidated so we investigated the effect of LPS from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a periodontopathic bacterium, on collagen phagocytic activity in human gingival fibroblasts and associated regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: LPS pretreatment stimulated binding of collagen-coated beads to cells and, subsequently, their internalization. RESULTS: The LPS-activated collagen phagocytic process was enhanced in the presence of the soluble form of CD14 (sCD14) or LPS-binding protein (LBP), while the LPS/LBP treatment activated Akt and induced actin reorganization. Furthermore, these LPS/LBP-induced effects were partially suppressed by adding phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS disturbs the homeostasis of collagen metabolism within gingival tissue by facilitating collagen phagocytosis by gingival fibroblasts, and serum sCD14 and LBP positively regulate the action of LPS. In addition, the PI3K/Akt signaling is thought to partially mediate the LPS/LBP-stimulated collagen phagocytic pathway, which may be dependent on actin cytoskeletal rearrangement.
TI  - RTX cytotoxins recognize beta2 integrin receptors through N-linked oligosaccharides.
AB  - Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin-hemolysin (Hly) (CyaA, ACT, or  AC-Hly) is a cytotoxin of the RTX (repeat in toxin) family. It delivers into target cells an AC domain that catalyzes uncontrolled conversion of ATP to cAMP, a key signaling molecule subverting phagocyte functions. CyaA utilizes a heavily N-glycosylated beta(2) integrin receptor CD11b/CD18 (alpha(M)beta(2), Mac-1, or CR3). We show that deglycosylation of cell surface proteins by glycosidase treatment, or inhibition of protein N-glycosylation by tunicamycin, ablates CyaA binding and penetration of CD11b-expressing cells. Furthermore, binding of CyaA to cells was strongly inhibited in the presence of free saccharides occurring as building units of integrin oligosaccharide complex, whereas saccharides absent from integrin oligosaccharide chains failed to inhibit CyaA binding to CD11b/CD18-expressing cells. CyaA, hence, selectively recognized sugar residues of N-linked oligosaccharides of integrins. Moreover, glycosylation of CD11a/CD18, another receptor of the beta(2) integrin family, was also essential for cytotoxic action of other RTX cytotoxins, the leukotoxin of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (LtxA) and the Escherichia coli alpha-Hly (HlyA). These results show that binding and killing of target cells by CyaA, LtxA, and HlyA depends on recognition of N-linked oligosaccharide chains of beta(2) integrin receptors. This sets a new paradigm for action of RTX cytotoxins.
TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the tad locus in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: a termination cascade.
AB  - The tad (tight adherence) locus of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans includes genes for the biogenesis of Flp pili, which are necessary for bacterial adhesion to surfaces, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis. Although studies have elucidated the functions of some of the Tad proteins, little is known about the regulation of the tad locus in A. actinomycetemcomitans. A promoter upstream of the tad locus was previously identified and shown to function in Escherichia coli. Using a specially constructed reporter plasmid, we show here that this promoter (tadp) functions in A. actinomycetemcomitans. To study expression of the pilin gene (flp-1) relative to that of tad secretion complex genes, we used Northern hybridization analysis and a lacZ reporter assay. We identified three terminators, two of which (T1 and T2) can explain flp-1 mRNA abundance, while the third (T3) is at the end of the locus. T1 and T3 have the appearance and behavior of intrinsic terminators, while T2 has a different structure and is inhibited by bicyclomycin, indicating that T2 is probably Rho dependent. To help achieve the appropriate stoichiometry of the Tad proteins, we show that a transcriptional-termination cascade is important to the proper expression of the tad genes. These data indicate a previously unreported mechanism of regulation in A. actinomycetemcomitans and lead to a more complete understanding of its Flp pilus biogenesis.
TI  - Enamel matrix derivative exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in monocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) is used clinically to promote periodontal tissue regeneration with variable efficacy. EMD application results in significantly higher frequencies of sites without clinical signs of inflammation; additionally, patients receiving EMD therapy report significantly less post-treatment discomfort. However, there are few reports that focus on defining the biologic mechanisms for the observed anti-inflammatory effects of EMD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of EMD on inflammatory-associated markers using an in vitro monocyte assay. METHODS: Rat monocytes were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml from Escherichia coli or Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) along with EMD (0, 50, 100, or 200 microg/ml). Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in conditioned media were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, the effects of exogenous PGE(2) on TNF-alpha production from LPS-stimulated monocytes were determined. RESULTS: LPS-stimulated monocytes exposed to EMD exhibited a decrease in TNF-alpha production (0.10- to 0.52-fold) and an increase in PGE(2) production (1.31- to 2.71-fold) compared to controls not treated with EMD. Exogenously applied PGE(2) decreased TNF-alpha production by LPS-stimulated monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and EMD treatment enhanced this PGE(2)-mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha production. CONCLUSION: In addition to EMD's published role in inducing proliferation, migration, adhesion, mineralization, and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells, our results indicated that EMD modulates two inflammation-associated factors, TNF-alpha and PGE(2), in monocytes.
TI  - A dominant function of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand expression and osteoclastogenesis induction by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria is one of the microbial-associated molecular patterns that initiate the immune/inflammatory response, leading to the tissue destruction observed in periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in lipopolysaccharide-induced receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) expression by murine periodontal ligament cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Expression of RANKL and osteoprotegerin mRNA was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The biochemical inhibitor SB203580 was used to evaluate the contribution of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to lipopolysaccharide-induced RANKL and osteoprotegerin expression. Stable cell lines expressing dominant-negative forms of MAPK kinase (MKK)-3 and MKK6 were generated to confirm the role of the p38 MAPK pathway. An osteoclastogenesis assay using a coculture model of the murine monocytic cell line RAW 264.7 was used to determine if osteoclast differentiation induced by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated periodontal ligament was correlated with RANKL expression. RESULTS: Inhibiting p38 MAPK prior to lipopolysaccharide stimulation resulted in a significant decrease of RANKL mRNA expression. Osteoprotegerin mRNA expression was not affected by lipopolysaccharide or p38 MAPK. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated periodontal ligament cells increased osteoclast differentiation, an effect that was completely blocked by osteoprotegerin and significantly decreased by inhibition of MKK3 and MKK6, upstream activators of p38 MAPK. Conditioned medium from murine periodontal ligament cultures did not increase osteoclast differentiation, indicating that periodontal ligament cells produced membrane-bound RANKL. CONCLUSION: Lipopolysaccharide resulted in a significant increase of RANKL in periodontal ligament cells. The p38 MAPK pathway is required for lipopolysaccharide-induced membrane-bound RANKL expression in these cells.
TI  - Stimulatory response of neutrophils from periodontitis patients with periodontal  pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neutrophils play a crucial role in the defense of invading bacteria by releasing biologically active molecules. The response of peripheral blood neutrophils was studied in periodontitis-affected patients and in healthy controls towards stimulation to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) extracts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral venous blood was drawn from 23 adult patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis (probing depth >or=5 mm, attachment loss >or=3 mm), and 30 healthy volunteers. Neutrophil response followed by metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion was assayed by zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, on both whole blood and purified neutrophils. In addition to periodontal pathogen extracts, known stimulating agents were tested, such as Escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phytohemagglutinin, and zymosan A. RESULTS: Neutrophil response, expressed as a secretion ratio under stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, measured in whole blood, showed no differences between periodontitis and healthy controls. Instead, in purified neutrophils from patients, MMP-9 exhibited a significantly higher secretion ratio with LPS and Pg (1.5- to 2-fold), whereas IL-8 showed a larger increase in secretion ratio (3- to 7-fold) in the presence of Pg, Aa, LPS, and zymosan A. CONCLUSION: Peripheral neutrophils of periodontitis-affected patients are more reactive as suggested by their significantly higher response toward periodontal pathogen extracts and other stimulating agents.
TI  - A second Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans autotransporter adhesin exhibits specificity for buccal epithelial cells in humans and Old World primates.
AB  - Previous work showed that the Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesin Aae demonstrated species specificity and tissue tropism to buccal epithelial cells (BECs) derived from humans and Old World primates, but a second, lower-affinity adhesin was noted. This study was designed to determine if Omp100 (also known as ApiA), a surface-expressed A. actinomycetemcomitans adhesin, is that second adhesin and if so to investigate its tissue tropism and species specificity. A targeted mutagenesis protocol was used to construct an isogenic apiA mutant and an aae apiA double mutant with wild-type A. actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha was used to express apiA to further assess binding parameters. Results indicated that the apiA mutant strain showed significantly less binding to BECs than its parent strain (P < or = 0.05). Further, binding mediated by ApiA was specific to BECs from humans and Old World primates, as seen in both wild-type A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. coli expressing ApiA (P < or = 0.05). Pretreatment of wild-type A. actinomycetemcomitans cells with anti-ApiA antiserum reduced binding in a dose-dependent manner. The aae apiA double mutant completely abrogated A. actinomycetemcomitans binding to both human and Old World primate BECs. Taken together, these studies indicate that ApiA and Aae, in concert, modulate binding of A. actinomycetemcomitans to human BECs. Since the BEC is a prominent reservoir for A. actinomycetemcomitans, identification of this second adhesin could lead to important therapeutic strategies.
TI  - The effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans LPS on human dendritic cells in vitro, and in a mouse model in vivo.
AB  - Interaction between different bacterial plaque pathogens and dendritic cells may  induce different types of T helper (Th) cell response, which is critical in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. In this study we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) with respect to co-stimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production and Th cell differentiation. Unlike Escherichia coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, P. gingivalis LPS induced only low levels of CD40, CD80, HLA-DR and CD83 expression on Mo-DCs. LPS from both bacteria induced considerably lower TNF-alpha and IL-10 than did E. coli LPS. LPS from all three bacteria induced only negligible IL-12 production. In a human mixed-leukocyte reaction, and in an ovalbumin-specific T cell response assay in mice, both types of LPS suppressed IFN-gamma production. In conclusion, stimulation by P. gingivalis LPS and A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS appears to bias Mo-DCs towards Th2 production.
TI  - [Production of interleukin-11 and interleukin-6 in cultured human gingival fibroblasts with the stimulation of lipopolysaccharides].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Escherichia coli (Ec) lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the production of IL-11 and IL-6 from healthy human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), and the effects of endogenous prostaglandin on HGF IL-11 and IL-6 production stimulated with the above LPS. METHODS: HGF were stimulated with Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS of different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) for 24 h. And HGF were also stimulated with the combinations of 10 mg/L Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS and 10(-6) mol/L indomethacin respectively for 24 h. Levels of IL-11 and IL-6 in the supernatants were quantitated by ELISA. RESULTS: LPS from Aa, Ec, at the concentration of 10 mg/L and from Pg at the concentrations 1, 10 mg/L significantly augmented IL-11 production by HGF. IL-6 production was also significantly increased by stimulation with Aa-LPS at concentrations 1, 10 mg/L and with Ec-, Pg-LPS at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L. In addition, IL-11 production was lower than IL-6 production by HGF stimulated with LPS. Indomethacin significantly inhibited IL-6 and IL-11 production in LPS-stimulated HGF. CONCLUSIONS: Aa-, Pg-, Ec-LPS may significantly increase IL-11 and IL-6 level in the supernatants of HGF, and endogenous prostaglandin may upregulate IL-11 and IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated HGF.
TI  - Neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser irradiation with low pulse energy: a potential tool for the treatment of peri-implant disease.
AB  - Bacterial contamination may seriously compromise successful implant osteointegration in the clinical practice of dental implantology. Several methods for eliminating bacteria from the infected implants have been proposed, but none of them have been shown to be an effective tool in the treatment of peri-implantitis. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of pulsed neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser irradiation (Nd:YAG) in achieving bacterial ablation while preserving the surface properties of titanium implants. For this purpose, suspensions of Escherichia coli or Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans were irradiated with different laser parameters, both streaked on titanium implants, and in broth medium. It was found, by light and atomic force microscopy, that Nd:YAG laser, when used with proper working parameters, was able to bring about a consistent microbial ablation of both aerobic and anaerobic species, without damaging the titanium surface.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide induces interleukin-6 expression through multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in periodontal ligament fibroblasts.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans plays a major role in the pathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from A. actinomycetemcomitans is a key factor in inflammatory cytokine generation within periodontal tissues. In this study, we identify major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, Escherichia coli LPS and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in a murine periodontal ligament (mPDL) fibroblast cell line. Immunoblot analysis was used to assess the phosphorylated forms of p38, extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK following stimulation with A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, E. coli LPS and IL-1beta. IL-6 mRNA induction was detected via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, while protein levels were quantified via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We utilized biochemical inhibitors of p38, ERK and JNK MAPK to identify the MAPK signaling pathways needed for IL-6 expression. Additional use of stable mPDL cell lines containing dominant negative mutant constructs of MAPK kinase-3 and -6 (MKK-3/6) and p38 null mutant mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were used to substantiate the biochemical inhibitor data. Blocking p38 MAPK with SB203580 reduced the induction of IL-6 mRNA by A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, E. coli LPS and IL-1beta by >70%, >95% and approximately 60%, respectively. IL-6 ELISA indicated that blocking p38 MAPK reduced the IL-6 protein levels induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, E. coli LPS and IL-1beta by approximately 60%, approximately 50% and approximately 70%, respectively. All MAPK inhibitors significantly reduced the IL-6 protein levels induced by A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, E. coli LPS and IL-1beta whereas only p38 inhibitors consistently reduced the A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, E. coli LPS and IL-1beta induction of IL-6 mRNA steady-state levels. The contribution of p38 MAPK LPS-induced IL-6 expression was confirmed using MKK-3/6 dominant negative stable mPDL cell lines. Wild-type and p38alpha(-/-) MEF cells provided additional evidence to support the role of p38alpha MAPK in A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS-stimulated IL-6. Our results indicate that induction of IL-6 by E. coli LPS, IL-1beta and A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS requires signaling through MKK-3-p38alpha ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK in mPDL cells.
TI  - Changes of immunoresponse in BALB/c mice neonatally treated with periodontopathic bacterial endotoxin.
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to analyze the effects of early life exposure to periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharides on immunoresponse. Newborn BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 20 ng lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli daily for 2 days, starting within 24 h after birth. The treated mice were given intraperitoneal injections of bovine serum albumin at 180 and 187 days of age. Seventeen hours after each injection, the mice were bled and sera were separated. Their sera were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The mean interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-6 and immunoglobulin E levels in the sera of mice treated neonatally with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide were significantly higher than those of the controls. However, in all cases, no significant difference was noted between mice treated neonatally with A. actinomycetemcomitans- or E. coli lipopolysaccharide and control mice. These data suggest that neonatal exposure to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces changes in immunological responses when the mice reach maturity.
TI  - Inactivation of DNA adenine methyltransferase alters virulence factors in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - DNA adenine methyltransferase (DAM) plays critical roles in diverse biological pathways in gram-negative bacteria, and specifically in regulating the expression of virulence genes in several organisms. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans plays an important role in the pathogenesis of juvenile and adult periodontal disease, yet little is known about its mechanisms of gene regulation. DAM is shown here to directly or indirectly affect well-known A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence factors. A mutant A. actinomycetemcomitans strain lacking the dam gene was created by homologous recombination and shows normal growth phenotypes when grown exponentially. This mutant strain has four sixfold increased levels of extracellular leukotoxin, altered cellular levels of leukotoxin, and significant changes in bacterial invasion of KB oral epithelial cells. These results provide a basis for further characterization of regulatory mechanisms that control A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence.
TI  - Immunoproteomics of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans outer-membrane proteins  reveal a highly immunoreactive peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein.
AB  - In a search for novel bioactive cell surface structures of periodontal pathogens, it was found that sera from two patients with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-associated infections reacted strongly at 17 kDa on immunoblots of A. actinomycetemcomitans outer-membrane protein (OMP) preparations. The 17 kDa antigen was also recognized by anti-CsgA (Escherichia coli curli major subunit) antibody. The 17 kDa A. actinomycetemcomitans protein was identified as peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL; AaPAL) by two-dimensional immunoblotting and subsequent sequence analysis by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. AaPAL was an OMP and a lipoprotein, and it had an OmpA-like domain. In a group of middle-aged subjects (n = 26), serum reactivity to AaPAL was associated with the presence of periodontitis but not with the oral detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Both human sera and rabbit antisera against three different types of antigens, the gel-purified AaPAL, A. actinomycetemcomitans whole-cell antigens, and CsgA, recognized putative PALs of oral haemophili in addition to AaPAL. The results demonstrated that the novel AaPAL is a conserved bacterial lipoprotein. It is expressed in vivo and is strongly immunoreactive. The antigenic cross-reactivity found between AaPAL and oral haemophili may enhance local and systemic immuno-inflammatory reactions in periodontitis.
TI  - Arginase activity in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not lipopolysaccharide from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans could stimulate arginase activity in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7 cells). METHODS: RAW264.7 cells were treated with A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli for 24 h. The effect of polymyxin B, l-norvaline, dl-norvaline, dexamethasone and cytokines (interferon-gamma and interleukin-4) on arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells was also determined. The cells were pretreated with anti-CD14, anti -toll-like receptor 2, or anti-toll-like receptor 4 antibody prior to stimulation with A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide. Arginase activity was determined by a colorimetric assay. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide stimulated arginase activity in RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but was less potent than E. coli-lipopolysaccharide. Polymyxin B and l-norvaline, but not dl-norvaline, blocked the arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Dexamethasone and interleukin-4 but not interferon-gamma augmented arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Treatment of the cells with anti-CD14 and anti-toll-like receptor 4 but not anti-toll-like receptor 2 antibody decreased arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans-lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that lipopolysaccharide from A. actinomycetemcomitans via CD14/toll-like receptor 4 complex molecules and the regulatory control of glucocorticoid and cytokines may stimulate arginase activity in RAW264.7 cells.
TI  - Identification of Fur-regulated genes in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an oral pathogen that causes aggressive periodontitis as well as sometimes life-threatening, extra-oral infections. Iron regulation is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of A. actinomycetemcomitans infections and, consistent with this hypothesis, the fur gene has recently been identified and characterized in A. actinomycetemcomitans. In this study, 14 putatively Fur-regulated genes were identified by Fur titration assay (Furta) in A. actinomycetemcomitans, including afuA, dgt, eno, hemA, tbpA, recO and yfe - some of which are known to be Fur regulated in other species. A fur mutant A. actinomycetemcomitans strain was created by selecting for manganese resistance in order to study the Fur regulon. Comparisons between the fur gene sequences revealed that nucleotide 66 changed from C in the wild-type to T in the mutant strain, changing leucine to isoleucine. The fur mutant strain expressed a nonfunctional Fur protein as determined by Escherichia coli-based ferric uptake assays and Western blotting. It was also more sensitive to acid stress and expressed higher levels of minC than the wild-type strain. minC, which inhibits cell division in other bacterial species and whose regulation by iron has not been previously described, was found to be Fur regulated in A. actinomycetemcomitans by Furta, by gel shift assays, and by RT-qPCR assays for gene expression.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of a super pulsed carbon dioxide laser at low energy density on periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: Previous studies have described the effect of irradiation by a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser at high energy density on oral bacteria, and various side-effects have also been observed. However, no published studies have examined the effect of irradiation by a CO2 laser at low energy density on oral bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of super pulsed CO2 laser irradiation on periodontopathic bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Bacterial suspensions of two species of periodontopathic bacteria received laser irradiation at energy densities of 0-12.5 J/cm2. The suspensions were then spread over agar plates and incubated anaerobically. The bactericidal effects were evaluated based on colony formation. Samples of LPS were laser-irradiated at energy densities of 0-12.5 J/cm2. The biological activity was measured, and LPS was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). RESULTS: The irradiation at low energy densities of 7.5 and 12.5 J/cm2 killed more than 99.9 and 99.999% of Porphyromonas gingivalis and more than 99% of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was sterilized by the irradiation at 7.5 J/cm2. LPS biological activity was significantly decreased by laser irradiation at energy densities of more than 7.5 J/cm2 (p < 0.05), and the components of LPS analyzed by SDS-PAGE was diminished non-specifically. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that CO2 laser irradiation at low power is capable of bactericidal effect on periodontopathic bacteria and decreasing LPS activity.
TI  - Influence of genetic background on transformation and expression of Green Fluorescent Protein in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The development of an electro-transformation system and the construction of shuttle plasmids for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have enhanced the molecular analysis of virulence factors. However, inefficient transformation is frequently encountered. This study investigated the efficiency of electro-transformation and expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in 12 different A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The influence of the plasmid vector, serotype, and phenotype were the major factors taken into consideration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve serotyped A. actinomycetemcomitans strains were independently electro-transformed with two different Escherichia coli-A. actinomycetemcomitans shuttle plasmids (pVT1303 and pVT1304), both containing an identical ltx-GFPmut2 gene construct but a different backbone (pDMG4 and pPK1, respectively). The transformation efficiency, transformation frequency, and electro-transformation survival rate were determined by culture techniques. GFP expression was observed at the colony level by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: All strains could be transformed with both plasmids. However, major differences were observed for the transformation efficiency, transformation frequency, and electro-transformation survival rate between strains. The data demonstrated that plasmid vector, serotype, and phenotype are key players for obtaining a successful transformation. An inverted relationship between the electro-transformation survival rate and tranformation frequency was also observed. GFP expression was also influenced by phenotype, serotype and plasmid vector. CONCLUSIONS: The serotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans has an important influence on its survival after electro-transformation and on transformation frequency. The expression of GFP is strain and plasmid vector dependent.
TI  - Differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hBD) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (HGE) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: Several strains of the periodontopathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli. The induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also tested. RESULTS: In addition to the published observations (PMA induces hBD-2 and -4; TNF-alpha induces hBD-2 and -3), it was found that PMA can upregulate hBD-1 and hBD-3, whereas TNF-alpha can induce hBD-4. The commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hBD-2, hBD-3, and IL-8. The pathogen P. gingivalis induced hBD-1 and hBD-3 at different time points than the commensals, but no induction of IL-8 and hBD-2 could be observed. These data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. A correlation was found between the pathogenicity of different serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and IL-8. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.
TI  - The effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. The purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The outcomes that were studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. STUDY DESIGN: At 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or Escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). Surviving fetuses were delivered abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). RESULTS: When compared with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. Only 6 of 22 fetuses that were exposed to intra-amniotic Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14 fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). Fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. CONCLUSION: Lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. Sources of inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.
TI  - Genetic and functional analyses of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans AfeABCD siderophore-independent iron acquisition system.
AB  - The Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans afeABCD iron transport system, the expression of which is controlled by iron and Fur, was identified in three different isolates. The protein products of this locus are related to bacterial ABC transporters involved in metal transport. Transformation of the Escherichia coli 1017 iron acquisition mutant with a plasmid harboring afeABCD promoted cell growth under iron-chelated conditions. However, insertion disruption of each of the afeABCD coding regions abolished this growth-relieving effect. The replacement of the parental afeA allele with the derivative afeA::EZ::TN<KAN-2> drastically reduced the ability of A. actinomycetemcomitans cells to grow under iron-chelated conditions.
TI  - [Cloning and sequence analysis of recombinant fusion gene of Escherichia coli heat-liable enterotoxin B subunit and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fimbria associative protein].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone the recombinant fusion gene of Escherichia coli heat-liable enterotoxin B subunit (Ltb) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fimbria associative protein (Fap). METHODS: Two couples of primers were designed for PCR according to the known sequence of ltb and fap. The ltb and fap gene were obtained by amplification PCR technique from plasmid EWD299 of Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 310 DNA respectively, and fused them by PCR. The fusion gene ltb-fap were cloning into plasmid pET28a(+). The recombined plasmid pET28a ltb-fap was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5alpha. The recombinant was screened and identified by restriction enzyme and PCR. The cloned gene was sequenced. RESULTS: The ltb-fap about 531bp in size was obtained successfully, and identified by PCR, restrictive enzyme and sequence analysis. CONCLUSION: The vector of pET28a ltb-fap was obtained.
TI  - The Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans autotransporter adhesin Aae exhibits specificity for buccal epithelial cells from humans and old world primates.
AB  - Cells of the gram-negative periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans express a surface-exposed, outer membrane autotransporter protein, designated Aae, which has been implicated in epithelial cell binding. We constructed a mutant strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans that contained a transposon insertion in the Aae structural gene (aae) and tested the mutant to determine its ability to bind to buccal epithelial cells (BECs) isolated from healthy volunteers. Significantly fewer mutant cells than wild-type cells bound to BECs. A broad-host-range plasmid that contained an intact aae gene driven by a heterologous tac promoter restored the ability of the mutant strain to bind to BECs at wild-type levels. This plasmid also conferred upon Escherichia coli the ability to express the Aae protein on its surface and to bind to human BECs. Aae-expressing E. coli also bound to BECs isolated from six Old World primates but not to BECs isolated from four New World primates or nine other nonprimate mammals, as well as to human gingival epithelial cells but not to human pharyngeal, palatal, tongue, bronchial, or cervical epithelial cells. Our findings indicate that Aae mediates binding of A. actinomycetemcomitans to BECs from humans and Old World primates and that this process may contribute to the host range specificity and tissue tropism exhibited by this bacterium.
TI  - Introns in the cytolethal distending toxin gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - In eukaryotic cells, genes are interrupted by intervening sequences called introns. Introns are transcribed as part of a precursor RNA that is subsequently removed by splicing, giving rise to mature mRNA. However, introns are rarely found in bacteria. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a periodontal pathogen implicated in aggressive forms of periodontal disease. This organism has been shown to produce cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), which causes sensitive eukaryotic cells to become irreversibly blocked at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In this study, we report the presence of introns within the cdt gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans. By use of reverse transcription-PCR, cdt transcripts of 2.123, 1.572, and 0.882 kb (RTA1, RTA2, and RTA3, respectively) were detected. In contrast, a single 2.123-kb amplicon was obtained by PCR with the genomic DNA. Similar results were obtained when a plasmid carrying cdt was cloned into Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis of RTA1, RTA2, and RTA3 revealed that RTA1 had undergone splicing, giving rise to RTA2 and RTA3. Two exon-intron boundaries, or splice sites, were identified at positions 863 to 868 and 1553 to 1558 of RTA1. Site-directed and deletion mutation studies of the splice site sequence indicated that sequence conservation was important in order for accurate splicing to occur. The catalytic region of the cdt RNA was located within the cdtC gene. This 0.56-kb RNA behaved independently as a catalytically active RNA molecule (a ribozyme) in vitro, capable of splicing heterologous RNA in both cis and trans configurations.
TI  - Abundant secretion of bioactive interleukin-1beta by human macrophages induced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a leukotoxin that selectively kills human leukocytes. Recently, we reported that macrophages are highly sensitive to leukotoxin and that their lysis involves activation of caspase 1. In this study, we show that leukotoxin also induces the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines from human macrophages. The macrophages were challenged with leukotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from A. actinomycetemcomitans or LPS from Escherichia coli, and the production and secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined at the mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Leukotoxin (1 to 30 ng/ml) induced abundant production and secretion of IL-1beta, while the effects on IL-6 and TNF-alpha production were limited. Leukotoxin (1 ng/ml) caused a 10-times-higher release of IL-1beta than did LPS (100 ng/ml). The secreted IL-1beta was mainly the bioactive 17-kDa protein. At higher concentrations (>30 ng/ml), leukotoxin caused secretion of mainly inactive cytokine, the 31-kDa pro-IL-1beta. The presence of specific antibodies to IL-1beta or of a caspase 1 inhibitor blocked the secretion and production of the cytokine. Supernatants of leukotoxin-challenged macrophages stimulated bone resorption when tested in a mouse calvarial model. The activity could be blocked by an IL-1 receptor antagonist or specific antibodies to IL-1beta. We concluded that A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin can trigger abundant production and secretion of bioactive IL-1beta by human macrophages, which is mediated by activation of caspase 1.
TI  - Depolymerization of beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine disrupts the integrity of diverse bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Polymeric beta-1,6-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (poly-beta-1,6-GlcNAc) has been implicated as an Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm adhesin, the formation of which requires the pgaABCD and icaABCD loci, respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis of poly-beta-1,6-GlcNAc, demonstrated for the first time by chromatography and mass spectrometry, disrupts biofilm formation by these species and by Yersinia pestis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, which possess pgaABCD homologues.
TI  - Genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of matrix polysaccharide in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are composed of bacterial cells embedded in an extracellular polysaccharide matrix. A major component of the Escherichia coli biofilm matrix is PGA, a linear polymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in beta(1,6) linkage. PGA mediates intercellular adhesion and attachment of cells to abiotic surfaces. In this report, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that PGA is also a major matrix component of biofilms produced by the human periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the porcine respiratory pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. We also show that PGA is a substrate for dispersin B, a biofilm-releasing glycosyl hydrolase produced by A. actinomycetemcomitans, and that an orthologous dispersin B enzyme is produced by A. pleuropneumoniae. We further show that A. actinomycetemcomitans PGA cross-reacts with antiserum raised against polysaccharide intercellular adhesin, a staphylococcal biofilm matrix polysaccharide that is genetically and structurally related to PGA. Our findings confirm that PGA functions as a biofilm matrix polysaccharide in phylogenetically diverse bacterial species and suggest that PGA may play a role in intercellular adhesion and cellular detachment and dispersal in A. actinomycetemcomitans and A. pleuropneumoniae biofilms.
TI  - Expression of cytolethal distending toxin genes from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Dendritic cells stimulated with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans elicit rapid gamma interferon responses by natural killer cells.
AB  - Human immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) responses are gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) dependent, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDCs) promote IgG2 production. DCs spontaneously emerge from monocytes in cultures prepared from localized aggressive periodontitis (LagP) patients, and these patients have high levels of IgG2 that is reactive with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. These results prompted the hypothesis that an interaction between mDCs and A. actinomycetemcomitans promotes IFN-gamma production, and IFN-gamma is known to promote both immunopathology and protective IgG2. A. actinomycetemcomitans induced mDCs to produce interleukin-12 (IL-12), and the addition of A. actinomycetemcomitans and DCs to cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes elicited high levels of IFN-gamma within just 24 h. In contrast, IL-4 was not detectable although DC-derived IL-10 production was apparent. A. actinomycetemcomitans-stimulated macrophages prepared from the same monocytes lacked the ability to induce IL-12 or IFN-gamma responses. NK cells of the innate immune system were the primary source of this early IFN-gamma, although CD8 T cells also contributed some. The NK cell-derived IFN-gamma was IL-12 dependent, and A. actinomycetemcomitans-DC interactions were Toll-like receptor 4 dependent. A. actinomycetemcomitans and A. actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were more potent than Escherichia coli and E. coli LPS in the ability to induce DC IL-12 and IFN-gamma. The ability of A. actinomycetemcomitans-stimulated DCs to induce NK cells to rapidly produce IFN-gamma in the absence of detectable IL-4 suggests their potential for skewing responses toward Th1. This may help explain the presence of Th1-associated cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from LagP patients and the high levels of IgG2 in their serum and GCF that is reactive with A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Induction of calprotectin release by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  - Calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. This protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory gingival tissue with periodontal disease. Recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. However, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. Neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P-LPS), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Escherichia coli. Calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by ELISA. Two subunits (10 and 14 kDa) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. P-LPS increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). Lipopolysaccharides from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. These results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.
TI  - Antigenic cross-reactivity and sequence homology between Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans GroEL protein and human fibronectin.
AB  - The immunologic cross-reactivity between human fibronectin and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans GroEL was examined. Analyses by SDS-PAGE/Western immunoblotting and ELISA showed that a polyclonal antibody directed against the purified GroEL protein of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but not against the Escherichia coli GroEL, cross-reacts with human fibronectin. No antigenic cross-reactivity was observed between anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL antibody and type IV collagen, another important constituent of the basement membrane. A comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL and human fibronectin revealed eight instances of four-amino acid sequence homology between the two proteins. Six of these tetrapeptide sequences were also shared with E. coli GroEL, suggesting that the remaining two tetrapeptides, GQLI (Glycine-Glutamine-Leucine-Isoleucine) and TGLE (Threonine-Glycine-Leucine-Glutamic acid), may be associated with the epitope that the anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL antibody specifically recognizes. Reactivity between TGLE, but not GQLI, with anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL antibody was confirmed by a biospecific interaction analysis using a biosensor technology. Although additional investigations are required, the observed phenomenon may lead to an autoimmune response and thus contribute to tissue destruction during periodontitis.
TI  - Implication of responses to bacterial heat shock proteins, chronic microbial infections, and dental metal allergy in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  - Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP) is a chronic relapsing skin disease characterized by sterile intraepidermal pustules and, usually, by scaly erythematous skin on the palm, soles, or both. To determine the primary pathogenic factors involved in the onset of PPP, we analyzed the implications of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are highly conserved immunogenic proteins, chronic microbial infections including marginal and periapical periodontitis, and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) against dental metals examined by patch tests. We found that the titers of IgG against HSPs of Escherichia coli GroEL and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans DnaJ in the sera from PPP patients were higher than those in the control group (GroEL; p < 0.05). Two patients with PPP had more than 1,000 ng/ml serum IgE level. We found that the average serum IgG antibody level against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the PPP patient group was higher than that of the healthy group (p < 0.05). DTH against dental metal was found in eight of 22 PPP patients. Six of eight patients reacted against more than two metals. Replacement of dental metal with resin in these patients resulted in the disappearance or remission of PPP. These findings suggest that the immune responses to HSPs produced by oral bacteria, HCMV infection, dental metal allergy, and their combinations are etiological factors for PPP. We concluded that various kinds of examinations, including oral cavity conditions and chronic infections, are essential to determine the major etiologic factors of PPP.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt): evidence  that the holotoxin is composed of three subunits: CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC.
AB  - We have shown the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor encoded by the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt)B gene, which is homologous to a family of Cdts expressed by several Gram-negative bacteria. We now report that the capacity for CdtB to induce G(2) arrest in Jurkat cells is greater in the presence of the other Cdt peptides: CdtA and CdtC. Plasmids containing the cdt operon were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli; each plasmid contained a modified cdt gene that expressed a Cdt peptide containing a C-terminal His tag. All three Cdt peptides copurified with the His-tagged Cdt peptide. Each of the peptides associated with the complex was truncated; N-terminal amino acid analysis of CdtB and CdtC indicated that the truncation corresponds to cleavage of a previously described signal sequence. CdtA was present in two forms in crude extracts, 25 and 18 kDa; only the 18-kDa fragment copurified with the Cdt complexes. Cdt complexes were also immunoprecipitated from A. actinomycetemcomitans extracts using anti-CdtC mAb. Exposure of Jurkat cells to 40 pg resulted in >50% accumulation of G(2) cells. CdtB and CdtC were detected by immunofluorescence on the cell surface after 2-h exposure to the holotoxin. CdtA was not detected by immunofluorescence, but all three peptides were associated with Jurkat cells when analyzed by Western blot. These studies suggest that the active Cdt holotoxin is a heterotrimer composed of truncated CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC, and all three peptides appear to associate with lymphocytes.
TI  - Expression of CD14, CD16 and CD45RA on monocytes from periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population, with phenotypes that change on activation or differentiation. Most of the monocytes express lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, CD14 intensely, and do not express Fc gamma receptor III, CD16 (CD14++CD16- monocytes). But monocytes expressing CD16 with reduced CD14 (CD14+CD16+ monocytes) increase in inflammatory diseases as well as sepsis and bacteremia in hemodialysis patients. CD45RA is expressed on activated monocytes, and is regarded as an activation marker of peripheral blood monocytes. The purpose of this study was to determine the phenotypic and functional alteration of monocytes in periodontitis patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood was collected from 33 aggressive periodontitis patients (22 females, 11 males), 55 chronic periodontitis patients (35 females, 20 males) and 30 healthy subjects (16 females, 14 males), and the expression of CD14, CD16 and CD45RA on monocytes was determined using flow cytometry. The production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by CD16+ and CD16- monocytes stimulated with LPS from Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was also examined using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of CD14+CD16+ monocytes was significantly increased in chronic periodontitis patients. Percentage of monocytes expressing CD45RA was significantly increased in aggressive periodontitis patients compared to healthy subjects. CD16+ and CD16- monocytes produced IL-6 in response to LPS from E. coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans, and the percentage of IL-6 producing cells was higher in CD16+ monocytes than CD16- monocytes, suggesting that CD14+CD16+ monocytes represent a hyper-reactive phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that CD14+CD16+ monocytes and CD45RA+ monocytes were increased in chronic and aggressive periodontitis, respectively. These findings suggest that alteration of monocytes in periodontitis patients could be evaluated by monitoring the surface expression of CD14, CD16 and CD45RA on monocytes.
TI  - Detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. We thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. METHODS: Autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel, subgingival calculus, and root caries. Periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. RESULTS: Subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. The calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655 nm. The autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. However, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or blood clots. For clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. CONCLUSION: The autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting subgingival calculus and root caries.
TI  - Two epithelial cell invasion-related loci of the oral pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Two invasion-related loci, apiA and the two-gene operon apiBC, were isolated from the oral pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans UT32. apiA encodes a 32.5 kDa protein that migrates on SDS-PAGE as a 101 kDa protein as detected by Western blot analysis or silver staining of an outer membrane-enriched fraction of Escherichia coli transformants. E. coli expressing ApiA have a different phenotype than the host vector, in broth and on solid media, and a colony morphology that resembles that of fresh A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates. These E. coli transformants bound to chicken collagen type II, human collagen type II, III, V and fibronectin. apiB and apiC encode proteins of 130.1 and 70.6 kDa, respectively. ApiBC conferred on E. coli a slightly enhanced ability to bind to collagen type III. ApiA- and ApiB-deficient mutants were constructed in A. actinomycetemcomitans. The ApiB-mutant had 4-fold diminished invasion of KB cells; the ApiA-mutant had increased invasion. Both loci were found in all A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, although polymorphism was detected only for apiBC. The deduced sequences of these invasion-related proteins are homologous to members of the YadA adhesin/invasin family.
TI  - Outer membrane protein 100, a versatile virulence factor of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is one of the pathogenic bacteria involved in periodontal diseases. We have previously identified six major outer membrane proteins (Omps) of Aa Y4. Among them is an Omp with high molecular mass, designated Omp100, which has homology to a variety of virulence factors. Electron microscopic observation indicated that Omp100 is randomly localized on the cell surface of Aa. Aa Y4 has been shown to adhere and invade KB or normal human gingival keratinocytes. Anti-Omp100 antibody inhibited 50% of adhesion and 70% of invasion of Aa Y4 to KB cells. An Omp100 knock-out mutant had a decreased adhesion and invasion efficiency of 60%, compared with that of the wild type. Escherichia coli HB101 expressing Omp100 adhered twofold and invaded 10-fold more than the wild-type E. coli HB101. HB101 expressing Omp100 showed resistance to serum by trapping factor H, an inhibitor for C3b, with Omp100. Omp100 induced inflammatory cytokine responses of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha in epithelial cells, and induced IL-1beta and TNFalpha production in mouse macrophages. These results indicate that Omp100 is a versatile virulence factor that may demonstrate potential significance in the onset of periodontal diseases related to Aa.
TI  - The production of 6-deoxy-L-talan from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans via bacterial coupling in vitro.
AB  - A method of producing 6-deoxy-L-talan, the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen (SPA) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,was established using a whole-cell reaction with two recombinant Escherichia coli strains. The production of serotype c-SPA was investigated using the dot blot assay with anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 serum after an 18-h reaction, starting with a solution containing the recombinant E. coli cells, alpha-d-glucose-1-phosphate, and dTTP. Moreover, examination of the time course for 6-deoxy-L-talan production proved that this system ran satisfactorily. This paper is the first report of a convenient method to readily produce the exopolysaccharide from A. actinomycetemcomitans in vitro.
TI  - Induction of T-cell apoptosis by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans mutants with deletion of ltxA and cdtABC genes: possible activity of GroEL-like molecule.
AB  - The pathogenic bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a leukotoxin (Ltx) and cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) with cytolytic properties. CDT also has cytostatic properties, inducing a G2 cell cycle block. The extent of the contribution of these, as well as other toxins, to the cytolytic and cytostatic activities of this microorganism have not been defined and the aim of this study was to determine their contribution. To that end, a naturally transformable A. actinomycetemcomitans clinical strain (D7S-smooth) was used to construct a series of deletion mutants (DeltacdtA, DeltacdtB, DeltacdtC, DeltacdtABC, DeltaltxA, DeltaltxA/DeltacdtABC). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with cell-associated and extracellular bacterial preparations. The ability of wild type and isogenic mutants to induce T-cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest was compared. The expression of ltxA and each of the cdt gene loci partially contributed to A. actinomycetemcomitans apoptosis, since each of the isogenic mutants exhibited reduced ability to induce T-cell apoptosis. Conversely, the ability to induce cell cycle block was abolished in each of the cdt isogenic mutants. A mutant with simultaneous deletion of ltxA and cdtABC genes retained potent ability to induce apoptosis in its cell-associated, but not extracellular, preparation. Neutralization with Escherichia coli anti-GroEL monoclonal antibody, lead to significant diminution of apoptosis-inducing activity of the DeltaltxA/DeltacdtABC cell-associated preparation. These data provide evidence for the expression of other A. actinomycetemcomitans cytolytic molecule(s) distinct from CDT and leukotoxin, with a possible role for GroEL-like molecule in T-cell apoptosis.
TI  - Detachment of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells by an endogenous beta-hexosaminidase activity.
AB  - When cultured in broth, fresh clinical isolates of the gram-negative periodontal  pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans form tenaciously adherent biofilm colonies on surfaces such as plastic and glass. These biofilm colonies release adherent cells into the medium, and the released cells can attach to the surface of the culture vessel and form new colonies, enabling the biofilm to spread. We mutagenized A. actinomycetemcomitans clinical strain CU1000 with transposon IS903phikan and isolated a transposon insertion mutant that formed biofilm colonies which were tightly adherent to surfaces but which lacked the ability to release cells into the medium and disperse. The transposon insertion in the mutant strain mapped to a gene, designated dspB, that was predicted to encode a secreted protein homologous to the catalytic domain of the family 20 glycosyl hydrolases. A plasmid carrying a wild-type dspB gene restored the ability of biofilm colonies of the mutant strain to disperse. We expressed A. actinomycetemcomitans DspB protein engineered to contain a hexahistidine metal-binding site at its C terminus in Escherichia coli and purified the protein by using Ni affinity chromatography. Substrate specificity studies performed with monosaccharides labeled with 4-nitrophenyl groups showed that DspB hydrolyzed the 1-->4 glycosidic bond of beta-substituted N-acetylglucosamine, which is consistent with the known functions of other family 20 glycosyl hydrolases. When added to culture medium, purified DspB protein, but not heat-inactivated DspB, restored the ability of the mutant strain to release cells and disperse. DspB protein also caused the detachment of cells from preformed biofilm colonies of strain CU1000 grown attached to plastic and the disaggregation of highly autoaggregated clumps of CU1000 cells in solution. We concluded that dspB encodes a soluble beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase that causes detachment and dispersion of A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic human B defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. Human B Defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. This peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Therefore, it is thought that hBD-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. However, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. The aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. The antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 was tested against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Escherichia coli. Antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were performed in vitro. The antibacterial activity of hBD-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, the activity of hBD-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. Our results suggest the possibility that synthetic hBD-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of cytolethal distending toxin production in periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a newly identified virulence factor produced by several pathogenic bacteria implicated in chronic infection. Seventy three strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria were examined for the production of CDT by a HeLa cell bioassay and for the presence of the cdt gene by PCR with degenerative oligonucleotide primers, which were designed based on various regions of the Escherichia coli and Campylobacter cdtB genes, which have been successfully used for the identification and cloning of cdtABC genes from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (M. Sugai et al., Infect. Immun. 66:5008-5019, 1998). CDT activity was found in culture supernatants of 40 of 45 tested A. actinomycetemcomintans strains, but the titer of the toxin varied considerably among these strains. PCR experiments indicated the presence of Y4-type cdt sequences in these strains, but the rest of A. actinomycetemcomitans were negative by PCR amplification and also by Southern blot analysis for the cdtABC gene. In the 40 CDT-positive strains, Southern hybridization with HindIII-digested genomic DNA revealed that there are at least 6 restriction fragment length polymorphism types. This suggests that the cdtABC flanking region is highly polymorphic, which may partly explain the variability of the CDT activity in the culture supernatants. The rest of tested strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria did not have detectable CDT production by the HeLa cell assay and for cdtB sequences by PCR analysis under our experimental conditions. These results strongly suggested that CDT is a unique toxin predominantly produced by A. actinomycetemcomitans among periodontopathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Cloning and functional expression of a novel GDP-6-deoxy-D-talose synthetase from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that can cause various forms of severe periodontitis and other nonoral infections in human patients. The serotype a-specific polysaccharide antigen of A. actinomycetemcomitans contains solely 6-deoxy-D-talose and its O-2 acetylated modification. This polysaccharide is synthesized from the donor GDP-6-deoxy-D-talose with the relevant talosylation enzyme(s). In the synthesis of GDP-6- deoxy-D-talose, GDP-D-mannose is first converted by GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMD) to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose and then reduced to GDP-6-deoxy-D-talose by GDP-6-deoxy-D-talose synthetase (GTS). In this study, we cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli the A. actinomycetemcomitans GTS enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GDP-6-deoxy-D-talose. The recombinant A. actinomycetemcomitans GTS enzyme expressed in E. coli converted the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-intermediate to a novel GDP-deoxyhexose. The synthesized GDP-deoxyhexose was shown to be GDP-6-deoxy-D-talose by HPLC, MALDI-TOF MS, and NMR spectroscopy. The functional expression of gts provides another enzymatically defined pathway for the synthesis of GDP-deoxyhexoses, which can be used as donors for the corresponding glycosyltransferases.
TI  - Effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils.
AB  - The effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils were examined. At the concentrations employed in this study, safrole did not significantly affect the viability of peripheral blood neutrophils as verified by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. However, exposure of neutrophils to safrole inhibited their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans, in a dose dependent manner. In addition, safrole inhibited the production of bactericidal superoxide anion by neutrophils as measured by cytochrome c reduction. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that safrole reduced the antibacterial activity and the superoxide anion production of neutrophils. Inhibition of the defensive functions of neutrophils may be one possible mechanism by which safrole compromises the oral health.
TI  - Transcriptional analysis of the 5' terminus of the flp fimbrial gene cluster from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Fresh isolates of the oral bacterial pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans exhibit a fimbriated, rough colony phenotype. Evidence suggests that the fimbrial subunit gene flp is part of a cluster of 14 genes (flp to tadG) thought to encode proteins involved in the synthesis, assembly and export of these fimbriae. To determine the transcriptional organization of the 5' terminus of this gene cluster, total RNA from rough and smooth phenotype variants of A. actinomycetemcomitans strain 283 were analysed by RT-PCR. Primers designed to amplify regions spanning gene junctions or multiple genes yielded amplicons at each individual gene junction from flp to tadD for both the rough and smooth variants. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of the rcpA to tadZ amplicon revealed that significantly more mRNA was transcribed from the rough than the smooth variant. Longer amplicons encompassing flp to tadZ (3.9 kb) and tadA to tadD (2.1 kb) were also detected, but only from the rough variant. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to identify the 5' end of the mRNA containing flp. Antisense primers located within rcpC, orfB and flp-2 enabled amplification of a RACE product that was subsequently isolated and subcloned into pGEM-T. DNA sequencing indicated that the 5' end of the mRNA was located at a G or T nucleotide -102 to -101 nt upstream of flp. Corresponding sigma(70) consensus sequences were located at -10 (TATAAT) and -35 (TTGCAT) relative to the transcription start site. These data confirm that the flp gene cluster is an operon transcribed as a polycistronic message commencing from a G or T nucleotide located in the intergenic region upstream of flp. Promoter function of the flp upstream region was confirmed using a lacZ reporter gene construct transformed into Escherichia coli. RT-PCR analysis further suggests that although transcription does occur in both the rough and smooth variants, full-length transcripts are rapidly degraded or are significantly downregulated in the smooth variant.
TI  - luxS and arcB control aerobic growth of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans under iron limitation.
AB  - LuxS is responsible for the production of autoinducer 2 (AI-2), which functions in Vibrio harveyi as a quorum-sensing signal that controls the cell density-dependent expression of the lux operon. In nonluminescent organisms, the physiologic role of AI-2 is not clear. We report that inactivation of luxS in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans JP2 results in reduced growth of the mutant, but not the wild-type organism, under aerobic, iron-limited conditions. Stunted cultures of the luxS mutant A. actinomycetemcomitans JP2-12 grew to high cell density when subcultured under iron-replete conditions. In addition, the mutant strain grew to high cell density under iron limitation after transformation with a plasmid containing a functional copy of luxS. Results of real-time PCR showed that A. actinomycetemcomitans JP2-12 exhibited significantly reduced expression of afuA (eightfold), fecBCDE (10-fold), and ftnAB (>50-fold), which encode a periplasmic ferric transport protein, a putative ferric citrate transporter, and ferritin, respectively. The expressions of putative receptors for transferrin, hemoglobin, and hemophore binding protein were also reduced at more modest levels (two- to threefold). In contrast, expressions of sidD and frpB (encoding putative siderophore receptors) were increased 10- and 3-fold, respectively, in the luxS mutant. To better understand the mechanism of the AI-2 response, the A. actinomycetemcomitans genome was searched for homologs of the V. harveyi signal transduction proteins, LuxP, LuxQ, LuxU, and LuxO. Interestingly, ArcB was found to be most similar to LuxQ sensor/kinase. To determine whether arcB plays a role in the response of A. actinomycetemcomitans to AI-2, an arcB-deficient mutant was constructed. The isogenic arcB mutant grew poorly under anaerobic conditions but grew normally under aerobic iron-replete conditions. However, the arcB mutant failed to grow aerobically under iron limitation, and reverse transcriptase PCR showed that inactivation of arcB resulted in decreased expression of afuA and ftnAB. Thus, isogenic luxS and arcB mutants of A. actinomycetemcomitans exhibit similar phenotypes when cultured aerobically under iron limitation, and both mutants exhibit reduced expression of a common set of genes involved in the transport and storage of iron. These results suggest that LuxS and ArcB may act in concert to control the adaptation of A. actinomycetemcomitans to iron-limiting conditions and its growth under such conditions.
TI  - Molecular cloning of the fur gene from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - In several bacterial species, iron availability in host tissues is coordinated with the expression of virulence determinants through the fur gene product. Initial experiments showed that a cloned Escherichia coli fur gene probe hybridized to Southern blots of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain JP2 (serotype b) chromosomal DNA. The A. actinomycetemcomitans fur gene was then cloned utilizing partial functional complementation of the fur mutant in E. coli strain H1780. Analysis of the cloned DNA sequence revealed a 438-bp open reading frame with a deduced 146-amino-acid sequence exhibiting 80% identity to Haemophilus influenzae Fur and 62% identity to E. coli Fur. The pUC Aafur gene probe (generated from JP2 serotype b) hybridized to representatives from all five A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes as well as to two strains derived from monkeys, suggesting that fur is widely distributed in A. actinomycetemcomitans. Open reading frames having >70% identity with the E. coli and H. influenzae flavodoxin and gyrase A genes, respectively, were found. Expression of the A. actinomycetemcomitans fur gene product repressed fiu expression and siderophore production in E. coli. A gel shift assay demonstrated that the expressed A. actinomycetemcomitans Fur protein bound the bacterial fur consensus sequence. Further characterization of the fur gene product in A. actinomycetemcomitans may improve our understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and may lead to specific therapeutic modalities.
TI  - Parameters associated with cloning in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Characterization of virulence traits in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans requires the application of recombinant DNA techniques. To develop appropriate genetic tools it is necessary to identify suitable host-vector systems. The current study assessed cloning parameters in A. actinomycetemcomitans for two previously described vectors, pDMG4 and pMMB67. It was determined that the maximum size of recombinant molecules that could be transferred to A. actinomycetemcomitans strain ATCC29522 via electroporation was 33 kb. The size limit for transformation of the same strain with ligation mixtures (direct cloning), however, was limited to 23-24 kb. Additional experiments included electroporation of various A. actinomycetemcomitans strains with plasmid DNA isolated from Escherichia coli and different A. actinomycetemcomitans sources. Differences in transformation efficiencies suggested the presence of a restriction modification system for pDMG4 in some strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Cloning of portions of the enterococcal plasmid pJH1 into A. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in the insertion of the intact vector into the chromosome.
TI  - Nitric oxide production by a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS-A. actinomycetemcomitans) could stimulate a murine macrophage cell line (RAW264.7 cells) to produce nitric oxide (NO). The cells were treated with LPS-A. actinomycetemcomitans or Escherichia coli LPS (LPS-Ec) for 24 h. The effects of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), polymyxin B and cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-12) on the production of NO were also determined. The role of protein tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C and microtubulin organization on NO production were assessed by incubating RAW264.7 cells with genistein, bisindolylmaleide and colchicine prior to LPS-A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulation, respectively. NO levels from the culture supernatants were determined by the Griess reaction. The results showed that LPS-A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated NO production by RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but was slightly less potent than LPS-Ec. NMMA and polymyxin B blocked the production of NO. IFN-gamma and IL-12 potentiated but IL-4 depressed NO production by LPS-A. actinomycetemcomitans-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. TNF-alpha had no effects on NO production. Genistein and bisindolylmalemaide, but not colchicine, reduced the production of NO in a dose-dependent mechanism. The results of the present study suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS, via the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C and the regulatory control of cytokines, stimulates NO production by murine macrophages.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation on root surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (A, B) of 40 teeth and 3 groups of 15 teeth (C, D, E). A defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 43719), Eikenella corrodens (ATCC 51724), or Peptostreptococcus micros (ATCC 33270). Subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group A, B) or 55 and 75 (group C, D, E) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. The source of laser radiation was an Er:YAG laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. The number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by the Scheffe-test. RESULTS: Depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the E. coli group was reduced by the Er:YAG laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the Staph. aureus group to 15.1%. The number of bacteria in case of A. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in case of E. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of P. micros to 22.0% after application of 75 laser pulses. CONCLUSION: Besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on root surfaces.

TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Characterization of two genes encoding ferritin-like protein in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Two genes encoding ferritin-like protein, designated afnA and afnB, were identified in the upstream region of actX on the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. The actX has been reported to be a regulatory gene homologous to the Escherichia coli fnr, which controls the growth and virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans under anaerobic conditions. The afnB located 340 bp-upstream from the actX, and the afnA located just 15 bp-upstream from afnB. The afnA and afnB encoded 161 and 165 amino acid residues, respectively, which were similar to ferritin-like proteins of other microorganisms. Western immunoblotting using rabbit antiserum against E. coli ferritin showed these two proteins, which are reactive with the serum with 19-kDa molecular masses, are produced from A. actinomycetemcomitans. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two proteins were consequent with those deduced from afnA and afnB. Northern hybridization revealed that the afnA and afnB constituted a bicistronic operon and the accumulation of afnA and afnB mRNA was upregulated under aerobic conditions. These findings suggested that the operon was regulated by the presence of oxygen. The two ferritin-like proteins may have important roles in the adaptation of A. actinomycetemcomitans to oxidative environmental changes.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis and Capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. To investigate the roles of TLRs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both TLR2- and TLR4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human CD14 and TLRs. When the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, Escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced NF-kappaB-dependent CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR2 cells. Although freeze-dried A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli also induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, freeze-dried P. gingivalis did not. Similarly, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, and E. coli induced CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells, but LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea did not. Furthermore, LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea attenuated CD25 expression in 7.7/huTLR4 cells induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from U373 cells, the secretion of IL-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and ICAM-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified LPS from E. coli. These findings indicated that LPS from P. gingivalis and C. ochracea worked as antagonists for human TLR4. The antagonistic activity of LPS from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans LuxS.
AB  - The cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. Although periodontal organisms do not appear to secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer II (AI-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in Vibrio harveyi. Here, we report that the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of V. harveyi luxS and secretes an AI-2-like signal. Cell-free conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain (E. coli AIS) expressing A. actinomycetemcomitans luxS induced luminescence in V. harveyi BB170 >200-fold over controls. AI-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. Incubation of early-log-phase A. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from A. actinomycetemcomitans or from E. coli AIS resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. In contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from E. coli AIS(-), a recombinant strain in which luxS was insertionally inactivated. A. actinomycetemcomitans AI-2 also induced expression of afuA, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that LuxS-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Finally, A. actinomycetemcomitans AI-2 added in trans complemented a luxS knockout mutation in P. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxS-regulated genes uvrB and hasF in this organism. Together, these results suggest that LuxS-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by A. actinomycetemcomitans and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.
TI  - Mechanisms of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans-induced expression of interleukin-8 in gingival epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gingival epithelial cells (GEC) are the first cells of the periodontium to encounter known periodontal pathogens, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) and, therefore, the role of this pathogen in the initiation of the inflammatory response is critical. However, little is known about the interactions of A.a. with GEC. In the present study, the mechanisms by which extracts from A.a. induced expression of the chemotactic cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in GEC, in vitro, were examined. METHODS: An established GEC line, PP, was co-cultured with sonicated extracts of A.a. under various in vitro experimental conditions, and the IL-8 secretion was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A.a. extracts induced a time- and dose-dependent expression of IL-8 from the cells. Dose-response studies indicated that the highest IL-8 secretion (7-fold, P < 0.01) was at the level of 50 micrograms/ml of A.a. extract. Time-course studies revealed a dramatic increase of IL-8 expression after 12 hours of continuous stimulation. Pretreatment with polymyxin B (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] inhibitor) did not reduce the IL-8 expression induced by A.a. extracts (P > 0.10). The introduction of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB 203580 markedly inhibited (> 75%, P < 0.01) A.a.-induced expression of IL-8. It is concluded that A.a. extracts upregulated the basal IL-8 expression in GEC. CONCLUSIONS: The effect was LPS-independent and involved a p38 MAPK signal transducing pathway. Understanding mechanisms of proinflammatory cytokine induction is important in periodontal pathology as it may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for periodontitis, thus controlling host inflammatory responses.
TI  - Characterization of serum antibody to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans GroEL-like protein in periodontitis patients and healthy subjects.
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that molecular mimicry between bacterial and human heat  shock protein 60 (hsp60) is involved in various conditions of autoimmune and infectious diseases. Many periodontopathic bacteria have been reported to express GroEL-like protein that is homologous to human hsp60. In this study, the presence of antibodies to the hsp60 of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in the sera of periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy control subjects was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a recombinant A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL as an antigen. Furthermore, their cross-reactivity with Escherichia coli GroEL and Mycobacterium bovis BCG hsp65 was examined. The mean values of antibody were 0.624 (range 0.088-1.113) and 0.728 (range 0.217-1.296) in control subjects and periodontitis patients, respectively. The antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans after absorption with E. coli GroEL and M. bovis BCG clearly decreased in both control subjects and periodontitis patients. The remaining antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans GroEL after absorption with M. bovis BCG hsp65 were higher than those with E. coli GroEL, indicating higher cross-reactivity with E. coli GroEL. These results suggest that not only periodontitis patients but also periodontally healthy subjects may be infected with A. actinomycetemcomitans but that the part of the antibody could be derived from the cross-reactivity with E. coli GroEL. Any relationship of the antibody to the disease, however, remains to be determined.
TI  - Recombinant Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin proteins are required to interact to inhibit human cell cycle progression and to stimulate human leukocyte cytokine synthesis.
AB  - It has recently been discovered that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, an oral bacterium causing periodontitis, produces cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), a cell cycle-modulating toxin that has three protein subunits: CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. In this study, we have cloned and expressed each toxin gene from A. actinomycetemcomitans in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant Cdt proteins to homogeneity. Individual Cdt proteins failed to induce cell cycle arrest of the human epithelial cell line HEp-2. The only combinations of toxin proteins causing cell cycle arrest were the presence of all three Cdt proteins and the combination of CdtB and CdtC. A similar experimental protocol was used to determine if recombinant Cdt proteins were able to induce human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to produce cytokines. The individual Cdt proteins were able to induce the synthesis by PBMCs of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and IL-8 but not of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-12, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, with CdtC being the most potent and CdtB being the least potent cytokine inducer. There was evidence of synergism between these Cdt proteins in the stimulation of cytokine production, most markedly with gamma interferon, which required the minimum interaction of CdtB and -C to stimulate production.
TI  - Reconstitution and purification of cytolethal distending toxin of Actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) has been found in various pathogenic bacterial  species and causes a cell distending and a G2 arrest against eukaryotic cells. All the cdtABC genes, which encode CDT, are known to be required for the CDT activities although the CDT holotoxin structure has not been elucidated. We cloned the cdtABC genes of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and constructed an Escherichia coli expression system for them. We found that crude extracts from six deletion mutants (delta cdtA, delta cdtB, delta cdtC, delta cdtBC, delta cdtAC, and delta cdtAB) of recombinant E. coli, which showed very weak or no detectable CDT activities, restored the CDT activities when pre-mixing and pre-incubation of them were performed in combinations to contain all the CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins. These results indicate that all the Cdt proteins are required for the CDT activities. We also found that the chimera CdtB protein, CdtB-intein-CBD (chitin binding domain) like CdtB protein itself assembled with CdtA and CdtC. The reconstituted CDT containing the chimera CdtB protein was specifically extracted by chitin beads and the only CDT portion was isolated from the chitin beads by a cleavage reaction of the intein. The purified reconstituted-CDT was found to consist of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins, and showed appreciable CDT activities, indicating that the CDT holotoxin structure is the CdtABC complex. To our knowledge, this is the first report succeeded in complete purification of an active CDT and may offer useful tools for elucidation of the toxic mechanism of CDT.
TI  - Elevated mRNA expression for supervillin and vascular endothelial growth factor in human neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Differential gene expression was examined in human neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis-LPS) using RNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR). LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli-LPS) was used as control. More than 200 differently expressed transcripts were found in 8 subjects showing differential regulation at the transcriptional level. Densitometric analyses revealed that 42-100 genes were upregulated, while 53-116 genes were downregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS compared with E. coli-LPS. The results of sequencing identification showed the presence of supervillin (SVIL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) genes in the clones which were upregulated by P. gingivalis-LPS. Consequently, semiquantitative analyses proved that the level of mRNA for SVIL and VEGF were significantly higher in P. gingivalis-LPS-stimulated neutrophils than in other bacterial (E. coli, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia) LPS- or synthetic lipid A-stimulated neutrophils. Our findings suggest that an elevated mRNA expression for SVIL could be associated with impaired function of neutrophils when stimulated by P. gingivalis-LPS. Further, the VEGF mRNA over-expression might be related to the pathogenesis of P. gingivalis-associated periodontitis. The RAP-PCR technique used in this study enabled us to identify a number of P. gingivalis-LPS regulated genes which hitherto have not been reported.
TI  - Induction of apoptosis in human T cells by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin is a consequence of G2 arrest of the cell cycle.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtB gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt) expressed by several Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, we have shown that CdtB impairs lymphocyte function by inducing G(2) arrest of the cell cycle. We now report that both CdtB as well as an extract prepared from an Escherichia coli strain that expresses all three of the A. actinomycetemcomitans cdt genes (rCdtABC) induce apoptosis. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with either CdtB or rCdtABC leads to DNA fragmentation in activated lymphocytes at 72 and 96 h. No DNA fragmentation was induced in nonactivated cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the Cdt-treated lymphocytes demonstrates a reduction in cell size and an increase in nuclear condensation. Mitochondrial function was also perturbed in cells pretreated with either CdtB or rCdtABC. An increase in the expression of the mitochondria Ag, Apo 2.7, was observed along with evidence of the development of a mitochondrial permeability transition state; this includes a decrease in the transmembrane potential and elevated generation of reactive oxygen species. Activation of the caspase cascade, which is an important biochemical feature of the apoptotic process, was also observed in Cdt-treated lymphocytes. Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene in the human B lymphoblastoid cell line, JY, led to a decrease in Cdt-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, Bcl-2 overexpression did not block Cdt-induced G(2) arrest. The implications of our results with respect to the immunosuppressive functions of Cdt proteins are discussed.
TI  - Downregulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression via EP2/EP4 receptors by prostaglandin E2 in human fibroblasts.
AB  - In the present study, the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was investigated. LPS were isolated from periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), by the phenol-water method and Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS was used as a control. PGE2 significantly inhibited A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression. Next, of four PGE2 receptor subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4), we examined which subtype(s) was involved in inhibition of LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression by PGE2. Eleven-deoxy-PGE1, a selective EP2/EP4 agonist, and butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, attenuated A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression, although butaprost was less potent than PGE2 and 11-deoxy-PGE1. Sulprostone, an EP1/EP3 agonist, and ONO-AP-324, an EP3 agonist, was inert to the LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP, a cAMP analogue, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, downregulated A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression in HGF. Our data suggest that PGE2 downregulates A. actinomycetemcomitans- and P. gingivalis-LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression in HGF, via EP2/EP4 receptors by cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. The cAMP-elevating agents such as EP2/EP4 receptor activators may serve to control inflammatory and immune responses in periodontal disease.
TI  - Immunodominant region of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 40-kilodalton heat  shock protein in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - Bacterial heat shock proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, and the immunological relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Escherichia coli DnaJ has been reported. Since there are similarities in the tissue destruction process of RA and periodontitis, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in sera from RA patients to the DnaJ protein from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that IgG titers to the N-terminal conservative region of the DnaJ are significantly higher in RA patients compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we examined IgG titers of disease controls to determine the specificity of the immune responses to this region in RA patients. The difference between RA and infectious disease patients was also significant (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of DnaJ from A. actinomycetemcomitans may contribute to the etiologic analysis of RA.
TI  - Effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  - Both tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the synthesis of t-PA and PAI-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). LPS from different periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. The levels of t-PA and PAI-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The mRNA for t-PA and PAI-2 were measured by RT-PCR. The results showed t-PA synthesis was increased in response to all types of LPS studied and PAI-2 level was increased by LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum, but not P. gingivalis. When comparing the effects of LPS from non-periodontal bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) with the LPS from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-PA to PAI-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to LPS from periodontal pathogens. The highest ratio of t-PA to PAI-2 was found in those cells exposed to LPS from P. gingivalis. These results indicate that LPS derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by HGF and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis and heterologous expression of the DNA adenine-(N(6))  methyltransferase from the human pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - We cloned and sequenced the DNA adenine-N(6) methyltransferase gene of the human  pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (M.AacDAM). Restriction digestion shows that the enzyme methylates adenine in the sequence GATC. Expression of the enzyme in a DAM(-) background shows in vivo activity. A PSI-BLAST search revealed that M.AacDAM is most related to M.HindIV, M.EcoDAM, M.StyDAM, and M.SmaII. The ClustalW alignment shows highly conserved regions in the enzyme characteristic for type a MTases. Phylogenetic tree analysis shows a cluster of enzymes recognizing the sequence GATC, within a branch of orphan MTases harboring M.AacDAM. The cloning and sequencing of this first methyltransferase gene described for A. actinomycetemcomitans open the path for studies on the potential regulatory impact of DNA methylation on gene regulation and virulence in this organism.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of conjugative plasmid pVT745.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence and genetic map of pVT745 are presented. The 25-kb plasmid was isolated from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a periodontal pathogen. Two-thirds of the plasmid encode functions related to conjugation, replication, and replicon stability. Among potential gene products with a high degree of similarity to known proteins are those associated with plasmid conjugation. It was shown that pVT745 derivatives not only mobilized a coresident nontransmissible plasmid, pMMB67, but also mediated their own conjugative transfer to different A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. However, transfer of pVT745 derivatives from A. actinomycetemcomitans to Escherichia coli JM109 by conjugation was successful only when an E. coli origin of replication was present on the pVT745 construct. Surprisingly, 16 open reading frames encode products of unknown function. The plasmid contains a conserved replication region which belongs to the HAP (Haemophilus-Actinobacillus-Pasteurella) theta replicon family. However, its host range appears to be rather narrow compared to other members of this family. Sequences homologous to pVT745 have previously been detected in the chromosomes of numerous A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The nature and origin of these homologs are discussed based on information derived from the nucleotide sequence.
TI  - Relationships between the onset of pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, periodontitis and bacterial heat shock proteins.
AB  - Relationships between the onset of pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, periodontitis and heat shock proteins were studied by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to examine levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against Escherichia coli GroEL, a recombinant DnaJ of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans heat shock protein, a synthetic peptide made from the 180th to the 188th amino acids of Mycobacterium bovis BCG Hsp65, and a recombinant human Hsp60, in sera obtained from 43 pustulosis palmaris et plantaris patients judged to have chronic infectious diseases of the oral cavity. We found that the titers of IgG against E. coli GroEL and A. actinomycetemcomitans DnaJ in the sera from pustulosis palmaris et plantaris patients were significantly higher than those in the control group, whereas the titers of IgG against the synthetic M. bovis Hsp65 and the recombinant Hsp60 did not differ significantly. Periodontal therapy and extraction of teeth with periapical infectious resulted in remission of pustulosis palmaris et plantaris and a statistically significant reduction in the levels of IgG against E. coli GroEL in 9 of the 22 patients (41%) examined. We also found that the IgG levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans DnaJ in 6 serum samples of 16 (37%) were reduced, but not significantly, after the treatment. These results suggest that the IgG responses to heat shock proteins partially induced by oral bacteria may be related to the onset of pustulosis palmaris et plantaris in some patients.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans thioredoxin (trx) gene and assessment of cytokine inhibitory activity.
AB  - Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous redox control and cell stress protein. Unexpectedly,  in recent years, thioredoxins have been found to exhibit both cytokine and chemokine activities, and there is increasing evidence that this class of protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In spite of this evidence, it has been reported that the oral bacterium and periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans secretes an immunosuppressive factor (termed suppressive factor 1 [SF1] [T. Kurita-Ochiai and K. Ochiai, Infect. Immun. 64:50-54, 1996]) whose N-terminal sequence, we have determined, identifies it as thioredoxin. We have cloned and expressed the gene encoding the thioredoxin of A. actinomycetemcomitans and have purified the protein to homogeneity. The A. actinomycetemcomitans trx gene has 52 and 76% identities, respectively, to the trx genes of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. Enzymatic analysis revealed that the recombinant protein had the expected redox activity. When the recombinant thioredoxin was tested for its capacity to inhibit the production of cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, it showed no significant inhibitory capacity. We therefore conclude that the thioredoxin of A. actinomycetemcomitans does not act as an immunosuppressive factor, at least with human leukocytes in cultures, and that the identity of SF1 remains to be elucidated.
TI  - impA, a gene coding for an inner membrane protein, influences colonial morphology of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Directed mutagenesis of a gene coding for a membrane protein of the periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was achieved by conjugation. The gene was disrupted by insertion of an antibiotic cassette into a unique endonuclease restriction sequence engineered by inverse PCR. The disrupted gene was cloned into a conjugative plasmid and transferred from Escherichia coli to A. actinomycetemcomitans. The allelic replacement mutation resulted in the loss of a 22-kDa inner membrane protein. The loss of this protein (ImpA) resulted in changes in the outer membrane protein composition of the bacterium. Concurrent with the mutation in impA was a change in the pattern of growth of the mutant bacteria in broth cultures. The progenitor bacteria grew as a homogeneous suspension of cells compared to a granular, autoaggregating adherent cell population described for the mutant bacteria. These data suggest that ImpA may play a regulatory role or be directly involved in protein(s) that are exported and associated with colony variations in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Th1 and Th2 cytokine profile in patients with early onset periodontitis and their healthy siblings.
AB  - Early onset periodontitis (EOP) is a chronic inflammatory periodontal disease with a strong genetic link affecting individuals aged 17 to 25. In the familial studies we tested the hypothesis about the role of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the pathogenesis of EOP disease. The study involved 6 individuals with EOP disease and their 6 siblings with healthy periodontium. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. a), a bacterium typical for EOP, was detected in all people studied. Th1 and Th2 cytokine production was measured after in vitro stimulation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and cultivated for 24 h and 7 days with PWM, A. a. or Escherichia coli. The levels of IL-4, IFN-gamma, IgA, IgG and IgM were measured by ELISA methods. After in vitro stimulation of PBMC, a significantly higher production of IL-4 and significantly lower production of IFN-gamma were found in the group of patients compared with their healthy siblings. The increased level of IL-4 in patients was in good agreement with an increased level of IgM after stimulation of lymphocytes with E. coli. These results support Seymour's hypothesis according to which patients with progressive disease primarily activate Th2 lymphocytes while non-susceptible individuals activate Th1 lymphocytes.
TI  - Expression of the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) operon in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: evidence that the CdtB protein is responsible for G2 arrest of the cell cycle in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtB gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt) expressed by several gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we report that the cdt locus in A. actinomycetemcomitans is composed of five open reading frames, designated orf1, orf2, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five open reading frames are highly conserved among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains 652, Y4, 29522, and HK1651. There is also strong homology with the Cdt proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi (87-91%), but only partial homology with that of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (29-48%). Analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans mRNA by RT-PCR suggests that the two small open reading frames upstream of cdtA are coexpressed with cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. We next utilized a series of plasmids that express various combinations of the cdt genes to determine their requirement for expression of immunoinhibitory activity. Cell extracts of E. coli transformed with each of the plasmids were tested for their capacity to induce G2 arrest in the cell cycle of PHA-activated human T cells. These experiments suggest that expression of cdtB alone is sufficient to induce G2 arrest in human T cells, but do not exclude the possibility that cdtC also contributes to cell cycle arrest. The implications of our results with respect to the function of the individual Cdt proteins are discussed.
TI  - Molecular characterization and functional analysis of a secA gene homolog in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Results of Southern blot analyses and polymerase chain reaction revealed that the Gram-negative pathogen, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, harbored DNA homologous to the secA gene of Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the secA gene product is essential for translocation of proteins across the inner membrane via the Sec system. This A. actinomycetemcomitans secA homolog was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Amino acid sequence analysis of the cloned gene revealed significant homology to the SecA proteins of Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, Caulobacter crescentus and Bacillus subtilis. Although the cloned gene did not complement a temperature sensitive mutation in the E. coli secA gene, strains harboring the cloned gene did produce a protein that cross-reacted with anti-SecA antibody. In addition, the cloned gene did restore sensitivity to sodium azide in an E. coli azide mutant. These data support the hypothesis that A. actinomycetemcomitans may use a system similar to the Sec system of E. coli to transport proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane, but suggest that the A. actinomycetemcomitans gene product may require genera-specific Sec proteins to complement some Sec mutations in E. coli.
TI  - Thymidine diphosphate-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase synthesizing dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 contains an unusual sugar, 6-deoxy-L-talose, which has been identified as a constituent of cell wall components in some bacteria. Two genes coding for thymidine diphosphate (dTDP)-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases were identified in the gene cluster required for biosynthesis of serotype c-specific polysaccharide. Both dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductases were overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmids containing these genes. The sugar nucleotides converted by both reductases were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and identified by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and gas-liquid chromatography. The results indicated that one of two reductases produced dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose and the other produced dTDP-L-rhamnose (dTDP-6-deoxy-L-mannose). The amino acid sequence of the dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose reductase forming dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose shared only weak homology with that forming dTDP-L-rhamnose, despite the fact that these two enzymes catalyze the reduction of the same substrate and the products are determined by the stereospecificity of the reductase activity. Neither the gene for dTDP-6-deoxy-L-talose biosynthesis nor its corresponding protein product has been found in other bacteria; this biosynthetic pathway is identified here for the first time.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the gene cluster responsible for synthesis of serotype e-specific polysaccharide antigen in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - A gene cluster associated with the biosynthesis of the serotype e-specific polysaccharide antigen (SPA) of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans IDH1705 belonging to serotype e was cloned and sequenced. This cluster consisted of 18 open reading frames. Escherichia coli produced the polysaccharide that reacts with the serotype e-specific antiserum when transformed with a plasmid containing the cluster. Comparing the structure of the gene cluster with similar clusters from A. actinomycetemcomitans strains Y4 (serotype b) and NCTC9710 (serotype c) revealed that a 5.3-kb region containing the distal half of one gene and two entire genes in the cluster from strain IDH1705 replaced a 6.2-kb region containing eight genes in the cluster from strain Y4, and a 4.7-kb region containing four genes in the cluster from strain NCTC9710. These results suggest that this region is essential to the antigenic specificity of serotype e A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Conformational studies of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin: partial denaturation enhances toxicity.
AB  - A 114 kDa, water-soluble, cytotoxin secreted by the Gram-negative bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is similar in sequence to Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin, but is non-hemolytic, killing leukocytes of select species, including humans. In this work, we investigated aspects of the water-soluble conformation of Aa toxin which relate to its biological, pore-forming activity. The toxin has five native tryptophans and fluorescence spectra were monitored in aqueous solutions in the presence of varying denaturants. Significant changes in the fluorescence spectra, without significant wavelength shifts, were induced by small additions of denaturants and changes in the temperature or pH. The fluorescence changes suggested that small perturbations in the aqueous environment resulted in structural changes in the toxin related not to a large unfolding but to more subtle conformational changes. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed the toxin to be a globular monomer in dilute aqueous solution. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed about 25% alpha-helical structure which is largely maintained up to a temperature (65 degrees C) known to deactivate toxin activity. Changes in the cytotoxic properties of the toxin were monitored with flow cytometric analysis following preincubation of the toxin under mild conditions similar to those used in the fluorescence studies. These experiments showed that the pretreated toxin exhibited enhanced cell-killing potency on toxin-sensitive cells. The correlation of cytotoxicity with the changes in Trp fluorescence is consistent with the idea that partial unfolding of Aa toxin is an early, obligate step in toxin-induced cell kill.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the hlyX-like gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4.
AB  - We isolated and characterized a possible regulatory gene, designated actX gene, from Actinobacillus actinomyctemcomitans Y4, which defined the Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae hlyX-like regulatory gene. DNA sequence analysis for plasmid clone pKM317 containing a 1.6-kb DNA insert indicated an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 257 amino acid residues. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence showed the presence of five characteristic cysteine residues in the N-terminal region and a putative DNA binding residue in the C-terminal region, indicating that actX might belong to a regulatory gene family. Escherichia coli DH5alpha and a mutant strain JRG1728 transformed by plasmid carrying actX manifested apparent hemolytic activity on sheep blood agar and grew anaerobically, although the original strains did not.
TI  - Localization of heat shock proteins in clinical Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains and their effects on epithelial cell proliferation.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an important pathogen in periodontitis. In the present study we localized the GroEL- and DnaK-like heat shock proteins (Hsp) in subcellular fractions of 12 A. actinomycetemcomitans strains of various clinical origin and compared their effects on periodontal epithelial cell proliferation and viability. In all strains, GroEL-like protein was found in the membrane, cytoplasm, and periplasm, whereas DnaK-like protein was present in the cytoplasm and periplasm. No correlation was observed between the Hsp expression and the serotype or origin of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The bacterial membrane fractions that expressed the GroEL-like protein moderately or strongly induced epithelial cell proliferation more strongly than strains that expressed the protein weakly. The results suggest that GroEL-like Hsp may play a role in the virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans by increasing epithelial proliferation.
TI  - Specific primer for AP-PCR identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - We used arbitrarily-primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) to design and construct a specific primer pair for the identification of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. We analyzed 25 DNA samples of A. actinomycetemcomitans isolated from patients with localized-juvenile periodontitis. From 90 AP-PCR primers screened, one amplification product was selected, cloned in pCR II vector, and sequenced. The sequence was used to design a single pair of specific primers. The sequence was compared with GenBank entries using BLAST and showed no significant matches. PCR amplification using the new primer pair AA1416 produced a characteristic 3.5-Kb band in all A. actinomycetemcomitans DNAs tested. Primer pair AA16S produced no or different amplicon profiles using DNA samples from bacterial species other than A. actinomycetemcomitans. Our results show that this single primer pair AA1416 can be used in PCR to identify A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates and differentiate them from other periodontal bacteria. These approaches appear promising in facilitating laboratory identification and taxonomy of putative periodontopathogens.
TI  - Direct selection of IS903 transposon insertions by use of a broad-host-range vector: isolation of catalase-deficient mutants of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Transposon mutagenesis in bacteria generally requires efficient delivery of a transposon suicide vector to allow the selection of relatively infrequent transposition events. We have developed an IS903-based transposon mutagenesis system for diverse gram-negative bacteria that is not limited by transfer efficiency. The transposon, IS903phikan, carries a cryptic kan gene, which can be expressed only after successful transposition. This allows the stable introduction of the transposon delivery vector into the host. Generation of insertion mutants is then limited only by the frequency of transposition. IS903phikan was placed on an IncQ plasmid vector with the transposase gene located outside the transposon and expressed from isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoters. After transposase induction, IS903phikan insertion mutants were readily selected in Escherichia coli by their resistance to kanamycin. We used IS903phikan to isolate three catalase-deficient mutants of the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans from a library of random insertions. The mutants display increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and all have IS903phikan insertions within an open reading frame whose predicted product is closely related to other bacterial catalases. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the catalase gene (designated katA) and flanking intergenic regions also revealed several occurrences of an 11-bp sequence that is closely related to the core DNA uptake signal sequence for natural transformation of Haemophilus influenzae. Our results demonstrate the utility of the IS903phikan mutagenesis system for the study of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Because IS903phikan is carried on a mobilizable, broad-host-range IncQ plasmid, this system is potentially useful in a variety of bacterial species.
TI  - Use of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin promoter to drive expression of the green fluorescent protein in an oral pathogen.
AB  - The gene for the green fluorescent protein, gfp, was cloned, under the control of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin (ltx) promoter, in the A. actinomycetemcomitans shuttle vector, pSU20. A actinomycetemcomitans containing the ltx-gfp construct emitted bright green fluorescence in the standard invasion assay using epifluorescence microscopy. These data demonstrate that the green fluorescent protein will be a useful tool for the live analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans interactions with host cells, and that the ltx promoter can be used to drive the expression of non-A. actinomycetemcomitans genes.
TI  - Identification of genes coding for exported proteins of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Random fusions of genomic DNA fragments to a partial gene encoding a signal sequence-deficient bacterial alkaline phosphatase were utilized to screen for exported proteins of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in Escherichia coli. Twenty-four PhoA(+) clones were isolated and sequenced. Membrane localization signals in the form of signal sequences were deduced from most of these sequences. Several of the deduced amino acid sequences were found to be homologous to known exported or membrane-associated proteins. The complete genes corresponding to two of these sequences were isolated from an A. actinomycetemcomitans lambda phage library. One gene was found to be homologous to the outer membrane lipoprotein LolB. The second gene product had homology with a Haemophilus influenzae protein and was localized to the inner membrane of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Induction of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - We examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/T lymphocyte autoantibody (ATA) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from periodontopathic bacteria; Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral Escherichia coli. All of the LPS induced IgM-ATA. Among these, LPS from C. ochracea induced the highest level of IgM-ATA, whereas that of P. gingivalis induced the lowest. The peritoneal T lymphocytes of mice injected with LPS were bound by IgM-ATA. Peritoneal B-1 (CD5+B) cells stimulated by each LPS produced much more IgM-ATA than splenic B-2 (CD5-B) cells, suggesting that B-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. Serum of mice injected with C. ochracea and F. nucleatum LPS showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. Binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by IgM purified from serum of the mice injected with C. ochracea LPS. Furthermore, serum of mice treated with C. ochracea, F. nucleatum or A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. However, purified IgM from the serum of mice treated with C. ochracea LPS failed to produce the same inhibition. Our results suggest that LPS from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce IgM-ATA in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans immunosuppressive protein is a member of the family of cytolethal distending toxins capable of causing a G2 arrest in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor (ISF) capable of impairing human lymphocyte function by perturbing cell cycle progression. We now report that ISF is the product of the cdtB gene, one of three genes encoding the family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt). The ISF polypeptide exhibits >/=95% identity with Hemophilus ducreyi CdtB protein and </=60% homology with Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni CdtB. Pretreatment of PHA-activated lymphocytes with 5-25 ng ISF results in G2 arrest of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Similarly, treatment of HeLa cells results in G2 arrest and cell elongation and distension. However, lymphocytes are at least 5 times more sensitive to ISF than HeLa cells and do not undergo the elongation and distension that characterizes interactions of Cdts with cell lines. ISF-treated lymphocytes express normal cyclin A and B1 levels, but contain reduced levels of cell cycle-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1). Additionally, the majority of Cdk1 is in the hyperphosphorylated, inactive, form. In contrast, PHA-induced G2 cells contain elevated levels of the hypophosphorylated, active Cdk1. Failure of ISF-treated cells to dephosphorylate Cdk1 is not associated with decreased availability of Cdc25. These studies suggest that the CdtB protein alone is capable of inducing G2 arrest in lymphocytes and cell cycle arrest, elongation, and distension of HeLa cells. Our studies also suggest that lymphocytes may be primary targets for A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB (ISF) and possibly for other Cdt family members as well. Thus, Cdts may function to impair host immunity and contribute to the pathogenesis of disease associated with Cdt-producing organisms.
TI  - LPS from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the expression of beta2 integrins and L-selectin in an ex vivo human whole blood system.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is assumed to be an important etiological agent in localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) and to have the ability to invade periodontal tissues. This bacterium has also been noted for its potential to cause serious extraoral infections. In this study, the effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans on the expression of the leukocyte adhesion molecules CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, CD11c/CD18 and L-selectin (CD 62L) were measured in an ex vivo whole blood system by use of fluorescent antibodies followed by flow cytometry. LPS from Escherichia coli, which is known to elicit a strong inflammatory response was used as a reference. The expression of the beta2 integrins CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, and CD11c/CD18 were significantly upregulated in granulocytes and monocytes. This expression was dose-dependent. The baseline levels of L-selectin was high on all three types of leukocytes, but on granulocytes and monocytes it decreased dramatically after stimulation with LPS. The LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans was equally potent as LPS from E. coli in its ability to affect the expression of the leukocyte integrins and L-selectin.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharide from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans stimulates production of interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in human whole blood.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) is supposed to be an important etiological agent in localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP). We have studied the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from these periodontopathogenic bacteria on synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in human whole blood. LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans in concentrations > or =1 ng/ml induced a significant production of all these proinflammatory cytokines, whereas LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli), strain 026:B6 had to be added in concentrations > or =1 microg/ml to obtain a similar effect. Similarly, LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans > or =0.1 ng/ml resulted in production of IL-1ra, while LPS from E. coli 026:B6 had to be added at > or =10 ng/ml to obtain similar effects. It has been suggested that the ratio between production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines may influence the outcome of periodontal diseases. Other in vitro and in vivo studies have, however, indicated that very large excesses (100-1000 times) of IL-1ra compared to IL-1beta are required to shift the IL-1ra:IL-1beta ratio in favor of an inhibition of IL-1 bioactivity. In our ex vivo system, we found that stimulation with extremely low doses of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS (0.1-1 ng/ml) resulted in IL-1ra production solely, without concomitant production of IL-1beta, the excess of IL-1ra over IL-1beta peaking at 1 ng/ml, which accordingly should suggest that LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans primarily has proinflammatory effects.
TI  - Identification of a cytolethal distending toxin gene locus and features of a virulence-associated region in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - A genetic locus for a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) was identified in a polymorphic region of the chromosome of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a predominant oral pathogen. The locus was comprised of three open reading frames (ORFs) that had significant amino acid sequence similarity and more than 90% sequence identity to the cdtABC genes of some pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and Haemophilus ducreyi, respectively. Sonic extracts from recombinant E. coli, containing the A. actinomycetemcomitans ORFs, caused the distension and killing of Chinese hamster ovary cells characteristic of a CDT. Monoclonal antibodies made reactive with the CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins of H. ducreyi recognized the corresponding gene products from the recombinant strain. CDT-like activities were no longer expressed by the recombinant strain when an OmegaKan-2 interposon was inserted into the cdtA and cdtB genes. Expression of the CDT-like activities in A. actinomycetemcomitans was strain specific. Naturally occurring expression-negative strains had large deletions within the region of the cdt locus. The cdtABC genes were flanked by an ORF (virulence plasmid protein), a partial ORF (integrase), and DNA sequences (bacteriophage integration site) characteristic of virulence-associated regions. These results provide evidence for a functional CDT in a human oral pathogen.
TI  - Cloning of the gene encoding the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b  OmpA-like outer membrane protein.
AB  - The gene encoding an outer membrane protein A (OmpA)-like, heat-modifiable Omp of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 (strain Y4, serotype b) was cloned by a PCR cloning procedure. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes a protein of 346 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 36.9 kDa. The protein expressed by the cloned gene reacted with a monoclonal antibody to the previously described 29-kDa Omp (Omp29) of strain Y4. This monoclonal antibody reacted specifically with Omp29 of A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype b), but not with any Omp of Escherichia coli, including OmpA. This protein exhibited characteristic heat modifiability on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, showing an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa when unheated and a mass of 34 kDa when heated. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein expressed in E. coli perfectly matched those deduced from the purified Omp29 of strain Y4. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene coding for Omp29 from serotype b matched completely (except for valine at position 321) that of a recently reported omp34 gene described for A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c (NCTC 9710). Because of the conserved nature of the gene within these serotypes, we designated the gene described herein from serotype b as omp34.
TI  - Differential expression of interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by human gingival epithelial cells in response to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  - Little is known regarding the molecules expressed by gingival epithelial cells that are involved in initiating and maintaining inflammation following the interaction with periodontal pathogens. Thus, we investigated the effect of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis infection on the expression of neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin 8 (IL-8) and the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells. The data revealed that both IL-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression increased after infection with A. actinomycetemcomitans (IL-8: 2- to 7-fold; intercellular adhesion molecule-1: 2.5- to 3.7-fold). IL-8 secretion reached a maximal level 6 h after the infection and the expression subsequently decreased to basal level. The increased cell surface intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression started at 4 h after infection and reached a maximal level 14 h after the infection. In contrast, the expression of both molecules rapidly decreased 2 h after challenge with P. gingivalis. This opposite influence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis infection on the expression of IL-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by gingival epithelial cells suggests that A. actinomycetemcomitans infection may initiate the recruitment of neutrophils, whereas the P. gingivalis infection may retard this process and therefore demonstrate a distinct perspective of virulence.
TI  - A gene cluster for 6-deoxy-L-talan synthesis in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The serotype c antigen of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans consists of 6-deoxy-l-talose. A gene cluster involved in the synthesis of serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen was cloned from the chromosomal DNA of A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 (serotype c). This cluster consisted of 17 open reading frames. Escherichia coli produced the polysaccharide that reacts with the serotype c-specific antibody when transformed with a plasmid containing the cluster. Comparing the structure of the gene cluster with a similar cluster from A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (serotype b), which produces a polysaccharide consisting of l-rhamnose and d-fucose, revealed that a 5.7 kb region containing seven genes in the cluster from strain Y4 was replaced by a 3.8 kb region containing three genes in strain NCTC 9710. The results suggest that these region, as well as dTDP-6-deoxy-l-talose-forming dTDP-4-keto-l-rhamnose reductase, is essential to the production of extracellular polysaccharide specific to serotype c.
TI  - The cell cycle-specific growth-inhibitory factor produced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been shown to produce a soluble cytotoxic factor(s) distinct from leukotoxin. We have identified in A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 a cluster of genes encoding a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). This new member of the CDT family is similar to the CDT produced by Haemophilus ducreyi. The CDT from A. actinomycetemcomitans was produced in Escherichia coli and was able to induce cell distension, growth arrest in G2/M phase, nucleus swelling, and chromatin fragmentation in HeLa cells. The three proteins, CDTA, -B and -C, encoded by the cdt locus were all required for toxin activity. Antiserum raised against recombinant CDTC completely inhibited the cytotoxic activity of culture supernatant and cell homogenate fractions of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. These results strongly suggest that the CDT is responsible for the cytotoxic activity present in the culture supernatant and cell homogenate fractions of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. This CDT is a new putative virulence factor of A. actinomycetemcomitans and may play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Interleukin-6 in neutrophils from peripheral blood and inflammatory periradicular tissues.
AB  - Periradicular tissue samples were recovered from patients undergoing endodontic surgery. Immunohistochemical procedures were used to identify interleukin-6 (IL-6) present in the neutrophils associated with these lesions. Using specific polyclonal antibody, 15 to 20% of the neutrophils associated with the periradicular tissue lesions were positive for IL-6. IL-6-positive plasma cells and histiocytes were also abundant. Cytokine production by neutrophils from the peripheral blood of nondiseased individuals was also evaluated. The cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and bacterial extracts of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Significant levels of IL-6 were produced by cells stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide B5 (933 pg/ml/10(7) neutrophils) and E. coli lipopolysaccharide B12 (791 pg/ml/10(7) neutrophils) when compared with unstimulated cells (39.31 pg/ml/10(7) cells). There was a dose-dependent increase in IL-6 production when cells were stimulated for 24 h with 6 and 12 micrograms/ml of A. actinomycetemcomitans extract. Less stimulation occurred with P. gingivalis, but it was also dose-dependent. Neutrophils resident in periradicular lesions may, therefore, provide a source of IL-6 in addition to that produced by tissue histiocytes and plasma cells.
TI  - Expression of iron binding proteins and hemin binding activity in the dental pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to express a polypeptide immunologically related to the Neisseria gonorrhoeae FbpA iron binding protein. In addition, the expression of hitB and hitC homologs was detected by Northern blot analysis. This periodontal pathogen also expresses a polypeptide homologous to the 31-kDa Haemophilus influenzae protein, which shows amino acid sequence homology with the FimA and YfeA proteins from Streptococcus parasanguis and Yersinia pestis, respectively. Both A. actinomycetemcomitans protein homologs were located within the periplasmic space, and their synthesis was regulated by the iron and hemin concentration of the culture medium. Southern and Western blot analysis together with molecular cloning revealed the presence of a Fur-like repressor, which may control the iron regulation of gene expression in this bacterium. Cultivation in the presence of hemin or Congo red revealed the ability of this organism to bind hemin. This binding activity was further confirmed by isolating Escherichia coli DH5 alpha clones that produced red and brown colonies on agar plates containing Congo red and hemin, respectively, after transformation with an A. actinomycetemcomitans gene library.
TI  - Aberrant expression and potential function for parotid secretory protein (PSP) in the NOD (non-obese diabetic) mouse.
AB  
TI  - LPS from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and production of nitric oxide in murine macrophages J774.
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) plays a complex role in the modulation of the inflammatory response, having either a pro-inflammatory or a protective role. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered an important etiological agent in localized juvenile periodontitis. We have studied the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from this periodontopathogenic bacterium on NO synthesis in an in vitro murine macrophage system. LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans induced a significant production of NO even at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, whereas LPS from E. coli had to be added in concentrations of 100 ng/ml to obtain similar effects. Production of NO was blocked by NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester, and pre-treatment of LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans with polymyxin B abolished the production of NO, while prostaglandin E2 enhanced the synthesis of NO.
TI  - Molecular characterization of an outer membrane protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans belonging to the OmpA family.
AB  - The major outer membrane protein (OMP) of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an OmpA homolog that demonstrates electrophoretic heat modifiability. The gene encoding this protein was isolated from a genomic library of A. actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 by immunoscreening with serum from a patient with localized juvenile periodontitis. Expression of the cloned gene in Escherichia coli and subsequent Western blot analysis revealed a protein with an approximate molecular mass of 34 kDa. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cloned gene demonstrated that the mature protein had a molecular mass of 34,911 Da and significant identity to members of the OmpA family of proteins. We have named the major OMP of A. actinomycetemcomitans Omp34, and its corresponding gene has been named omp34.
TI  - Identification of a genetic locus essential for serotype b-specific antigen synthesis in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - A large gene cluster associated with the biosynthesis of the serotype-specific polysaccharide antigen (SPA) of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (serotype b) was cloned and characterized. Western blot analysis showed that Escherichia coli DH5alpha, containing a plasmid carrying this cluster, produced a polysaccharide which reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed against the SPA of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis indicated that the polysaccharide produced by an E. coli transformant, as well as A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 SPA, was composed of rhamnose and fucose. Furthermore, using various derivatives of the plasmid, we demonstrated that the cloned 13-kb BssHII-BspHI fragment was indispensable for SPA synthesis in E. coli DH5alpha. The 24,909-bp nucleotide sequence, which included this fragment and its flanking regions, was determined. In the sequenced area, 24 open reading frames (ORFs) with the same orientation were found. Most of these were located sequentially within a short distance of each other. Many of the deduced amino acid sequences were similar to the gene products of the polysaccharide synthetic genes of other bacteria. The average G+C content (37.7%) of all 24 ORFs in the sequenced area was lower than that (45.6%) of the whole chromosome of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. It is noteworthy the average G+C content of the nine ORFs in the 8.5-kb central region of the 13-kb BssHII-BspHI fragment indispensable for SPA synthesis in E. coli was found to be especially low (27.0%).
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of part of the S10 operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the 5.2 kb EcoRI fragment that contained part of the S10 operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDC Y4. The order of the ribosomal protein genes was identical to that of the S10 operon of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins in this operon displayed significant homologies (65.3%-100%) to those of H. influenzae, E. coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Phylogenetic trees obtained for these ribosomal proteins were similar to that obtained for 16S rRNA.
TI  - Extracts of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as Escherichia coli on bone formation, clone MC3T3-E1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. The addition of the sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. By contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis, and Escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. The addition of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. Polymyxin B did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kDa eluted from Sephadex G-200 column. The inhibitory substances of Prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
TI  - Secretion of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. It was recently demonstrated that PMN have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. We therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-8 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) secreted by PMN from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium Escherichia coli. A actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. coli LPS stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 than the control unstimulated PMN (p < 0.01). The levels of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 released from cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans or E. coli LPS (p < 0.05). On the other hand, substantially greater amounts of IL-1ra were released from PMN stimulated with each LPS and from control unstimulated PMN during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of IL-1ra were secreted by PMN stimulated with A. actinomycetemcomitans and E.coli LPS during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). The inhibitory effects of IL-1ra on the biological activity of IL-1 in the supernatants of PMN were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. The supernatants of PMN stimulated with each LPS showed less biological IL-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human IL-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of PMN stimulated with P. gingivalis or C. ochracea LPS. These findings demonstrated that LPS from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating PMN to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as IL-1ra. Different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various LPS might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the dnaKJ operon from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The dnaKJ operon of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 was cloned by the DNA-probing method using synthetic oligonucleotides designed on the basis of two conserved regions in DnaK/hsp70 proteins and sequenced by inverse PCR. The sequenced region was shown to contain two open reading frames coding for proteins analogous to DnaK and DnaJ.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans gene encoding a heat-shock protein 90 homologue.
AB  - In a search for clones from a lambda gt11 expression library of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) genomic DNA that expressed epitopes from a 70-kDa iron-repressible membrane protein, we inadvertently identified clones that encoded a member of the 90-kDa heat-shock protein (HSP 90) family. The gene appears to encode a homologue of HtpG, as the nucleotide sequence has approximately 70% identity with the Escherichia coli (Ec) and Vibrio fischeri htpG. Growth of an Aa htpG insertion mutant at 42 degrees C was reduced to 50% of the parent strain, similar to an Ec htpG deletion mutant. These data suggest that Aa HtpG performs a function similar to Ec HtpG.
TI  - Extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine T cells.
AB  - Products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. It has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (SAg) activity. SAg bind simultaneously to the V beta chain of T cell receptors and to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. In order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic T cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old Balb/c (H-2d), C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C3H/HeJ (H-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. Laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. Unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to SEB, Con A and Escherichia coli LPS. Thymocytes responded to Con A and SEB, but not to LPS or to any sonic extract. Spleen cells depleted of B cells by panning responded to SEB and Con A, but not to LPS and showed a reduced response to sonicates. The residual response of B cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 + C'. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not limiting. These results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine T cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.
TI  - Prostaglandin production via induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the involvement of cyclooxygenase-1(COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in PGE2 production by human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from periodondopathogenic bacteria. LPS were isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans) and Eschericia coli (E coli) by the phenol-water procedure. The three LPS preparations produced PCE2 up to 48 h in a time-dependent manner in human gingival fibroblasts. P. gingivalis-LPS was the most potent stimulator of PGE2 production and, to a lesser extent, A actinomycetemcomitans- and E coli-LPS. Treatment of the cells with indomethacin, a non selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor and NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, completely depressed PGE2 production. Treatment of dexamethasone, known to inhibit COX-2 expression, also significantly prevented PGE2 production. Immunohistochemical staining of COX-2 protein demonstrated that expression of COX-2 protein was increased at 24 h after P gingivalis-LPS stimulation, while expression of COX-1 protein was not affected by P. gingivalis-LPS. In order to investigate the regulation of PGE2 production. P. gingivalis-LPS-stimulated cells were treated with herbimycin A and genistein, both inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. Both the inhibitors significantly inhibited PGE2 production. Herbimycin A treatment depressed expression of COX-2 protein. These data suggest that human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with LPS from periodontopathogenic bacteria mainly produce PGE2 not by COX-1, but by COX-2, induction of which may be regulated by tyrosine kinase and that the produced PGE2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of hemolytic genes from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Periodontopathic Actinobacillus actinomyceremcomitans produces hemolysin and other leukotoxins. In the present study, two distinct clones which lysed horse erythrocytes were isolated by screening genomic DNA libraries of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 on blood agar plates. DNA hybridization analysis indicates that there were two distinct hemolytic genes present. Sonicated extracts from both Escherichia coli clones possessed hemolytic activities on horse, sheep and human erythrocytes, but not those of rabbit. Rabbit antiserum to A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 whole cells inhibited the hemolytic activities of these clones.
TI  - Host responses induced by co-infection with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a murine model.
AB  - In this study, evidence is presented that mixed infection with the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans results in a synergistic effect in their pathogenicity and in their ability to induce humoral and cellular host responses. BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously on the back with P. gingivalis ATCC 53977, A. actinomycetemocomitans 75 or a mixture of both bacteria. Samples of blood and fluid from abscesses formed at the site of injection (first degree) or distant from the injection site were collected for microbiologic analysis. Serum and spleens were obtained for evaluation of humoral and cellular responses to P. gingivalis and A actinomycetemocomitans. Mice injected with A. actinomycetemcomitans had first-degree lesions only, whereas mice injected with P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans had lesions at first- and second-degree sites from which both bacterial species were isolated. A serum anti-P. gingivalis response was induced in P. gingivalis-injected mice, which was higher in mice injected with P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. This pattern was not seen in the anti-A, actinomycetemcomitans response. Lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and P. gingivalis of spleen cells from infected mice were decreased, especially following co-infection. Furthermore, co-infection of mice resulted in the greatest decrease in the number of CD5+, especially CD4+ lymphocytes.
TI  - The role of endotoxin and cytokines in the pathogenesis of odontogenic cysts.
AB  - Odontogenic cysts arise from tooth-forming epithelial residues. The stimulus for  the formation of radicular cysts is thought to be endotoxin released from the infected necrotic tooth pulp. However, in keratocysts and follicular cysts, such a stimulus is not present. In order to investigate what drives the cyst epithelium to proliferate, explant media and fluids from 16 radicular cysts, eight keratocysts and seven follicular cysts and explant media from four specimens of non-inflamed gingival tissue were examined for the presence of endotoxin and cytokines. Cyst fluids were also cultured for 72 h in anaerobic and aerobic conditions to detect micro-organisms. Endotoxin from three different bacteria, cytokines [interleukin-(IL) 1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6] as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were tested in an epithelial cell-proliferation assay. As the cyst epithelium is supported by a connective tissue capsule, the effect of fibroblast culture media on epithelial cell proliferation was also investigated. The results showed significantly higher concentrations of endotoxin in radicular cyst fluid than in the keratocyst or the follicular cyst. None of the cyst fluids contained micro-organisms. Immunoassays demonstrated the presence of IL-1 alpha and -6 in all fluids and explants tested; IL-1 beta was only found in the inflammatory radicular cysts. However, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNAs for IL-1 alpha, -1 beta and -6 were present in all cyst types. Proliferation studies indicated that endotoxin and the cytokines had a mitogenic effect on epithelia at low concentrations; PGE2 had very little effect at low concentrations, and had an inhibitory effect at high concentrations. Cyst fibroblast culture media had a mitogenic effect on the epithelia that was enhanced by the presence of endotoxin.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans promote osteoclastic differentiation in vitro.
AB  - Bacterial lipopolysaccharides possess bone-resorbing activity. Here, lipopolysaccharides from three putative periodontopathic bacteria were examined for effects on osteoclast-like cell formation of bone marrow cells from lipopolysaccharide-responsive C3H-HeN and non-responsive C3H/HeJ mice. The bone marrow cells were cultured with or without various doses of lipopolysaccharide in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone. These lipopolysaccharide preparations significantly increased the number of osteoclast-like cells formed in the culture of C3H/HeN marrow cells; the same as lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli and a synthetic lipid A with E. coli-type structure (LA-15-PP), at doses from 0.1 to 1 microgram/ml. This stimulating effect of each lipopolysaccharides was uniformly abrogated by the addition of polymyxin B at 5 micrograms/ml. All the lipopolysaccharide and the synthetic lipid A had no effect on osteoclast formation of the C3H/HeJ marrow cells, whereas lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia showed significant mitogenic activity on C3H/HeJ spleen cells. It seems likely that the activity of lipopolysaccharides to augment osteoclast-like cell formation in the bone marrow cell cultures is derived from a common structure of the lipid A portion.
TI  - Novel FNR homologues identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Based upon DNA sequence data and positive immunochemical reactivity of expressed  protein, novel homologues of the FNR family were identified in four representative oral facultative anaerobes: Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The similarity to E. coli FNR and to HlyX (itself 71% similar to E. coli FNR, while regulating expression of hemolysin operon in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae) was estimated from the deduced partial amino acid sequence to be, in the above order of tested species, 98, 98, 86, and 85%, and 75, 75, 88, and 88%, respectively. The phylogenetic relatedness indicates a rather closer link of HlyX to the FNR homologues from both pathogens, H. aphrophilus and A. actinomycetemcomitans. The possibility that the A. actinomycetemcomitans FNR homologue functions as a redox-sensing transcriptional factor to regulate, in addition to anaerobic respiration, microaerobic expression of the leukotoxin operon (ltx gene) is suggested.
TI  - Surface-associated material from the bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans contains a peptide which, in contrast to lipopolysaccharide, directly stimulates fibroblast interleukin-6 gene transcription.
AB  - The oral commensal Gram-negative bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is believed to be the causative organism of localized juvenile periodontitis, a disease in which there is rapid loss of alveolar bone supporting the teeth. Previously, we have reported that gentle saline extraction of this bacterium removed a loosely adherent proteinaceous fraction from the cell surface of the bacterium, which we have termed surface-associated material. This material contained potent bone-resorbing activity. We now report that surface-associated material is also a potent stimulator of cytokines, and in particular, interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis, while the lipopolysaccharide from this bacterium is only a weak stimulator of IL-6 synthesis by fibroblasts and monocytes. In contrast to enteric lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which induces fibroblast IL-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha synthesis, surface-associated material stimulated gingival fibroblasts to synthesize only IL-6, with no induction of IL-1 or TNF (the normal inducers of IL-6 synthesis). Reverse transcriptase PCR also failed to detect mRNA for IL-1 or TNF in surface-associated-material-stimulated fibroblasts, although both mRNAs were present in Escherichia coli LPS-stimulated cells. Neutralizing antibodies to IL-1 and/or TNF or the natural IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) inhibited enteric LPS-induced IL-6 synthesis, but did not inhibit surface-associated-material-induced synthesis. In addition, dexamethasone, which completely suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 synthesis, only inhibited surface-associated-material-induced IL-6 synthesis by 50%. This suggests that the active constituent in the surface-associated material stimulates IL-6 gene transcription by a transcriptional control mechanism distinct to that of E. coli LPS. The IL-6 stimulating activity of the surface-associated material is inhibited by both heat and trypsin, suggesting that it is proteinaceous. The activity has been isolated using anion-exchange, reverse-phase and size-exclusion HPLC. The active moiety is a peptide of molecular mass 2kDa which may be the product of a bacterial short open reading frame.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. In the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt A gene of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp A gene of Treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. These gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the PCR assays. Primers for P. gingivalis detected P. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of Capnocytophaga, 3 species of Prevotella, 2 species of Porphyromonas other than P. gingivalis, Bacteroides levii, Escherichia coli, 3 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of T. denticola. PCR analysis using primers for the lkt A gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Primers selected from the tdp A gene of T. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except T. denticola serovars a, b, and c. Thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either P. gingivalis (33277), A. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717 and 43718) or T. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). The PCR assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.
TI  - Comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (SAM), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated bone and on various mammalian cell populations. In this study, the relative ability of the SAM from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha has been investigated. The bacteria investigated were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus. Human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the SAM, or of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each SAM. All SAMs demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - Mono-Mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. Activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. However, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each SAM when compared on a concentration basis (w/v). The most active SAM was from A. actinomycetemcomitans with those from E. corrodens and P. gingivalis being slightly less active. The least active cytokine-stimulating SAMs were from C. rectus and Pr. intermedia. One major difference between the SAMs and E. coli LPS was the inability of the former to stimulate HGFs to release IL-1 beta or TNF alpha although they could stimulate PBMCs to release these cytokines. This may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.
TI  - Viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium VMGA III.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the survival in VMGA III of Porphyromonas  gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. Laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and Escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. Also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in VMGA III. Each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. One portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). The results of the clinical part indicate that the detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. Enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. However, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. Similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for E. coli. P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum survived better in the presence of E. coli than alone, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with E. coli. VMGA III appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. After 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.
TI  - Synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines by human gingival fibroblasts in response  to lipopolysaccharides and interleukin-1 beta.
AB  - We have examined the ability of gingival fibroblasts (GF) to participate in inflammatory response and function as accessory immune cells. The accessory immune function of GF cells was evaluated by their ability to elaborate proinflammatory cytokines following stimulation with lipopolysaccharides and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Using three separate clonally derived and characterized human gingival fibroblast (GF) cell lines, we demonstrate that LPS from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Escherichia coli (Ec) induce mRNA and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8. IL-1 beta activation of GF cells showed that IL-1 beta non only induces the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, but also acts in an autocrine manner of GF cells and induces IL-1 beta expression. Furthermore, the continuous presence of IL-1 beta in GF cell cultures did not down regulate the response of GF cells to IL-1 beta. Pretreatment of GF cells with IL-1 beta resulted in the enhanced synthesis of TNF-alpha in response to additional IL-1 beta. These findings indicate that GF cells, in addition to providing structural support, may also function as accessory immune cells and play an important role in the initial inflammatory reaction as well as in the amplification of immune response.
TI  - The potent bone-resorbing mediator of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is homologous to the molecular chaperone GroEL.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative bacterium implicated in the pathology of localized juvenile periodontitis, a condition involving rapid destruction of alveolar bone. We have established that gentle extraction of this bacterium in saline releases a proteinaceous fraction (which we have termed surface-associated material [SAM] which has potent osteolytic activity in the murine calvarial bone resorption assay. Fractionation of the SAM has now revealed that activity is associated with a 62-kD protein. This bone-resorbing activity can be blocked by a monoclonal antibody (raised to the whole bacterium) that is claimed to recognize a protein homologous to the Escherichia coli molecular chaperone GroEL. Purification of this bone-resorbing protein to homogeneity has been achieved by a combination of anion exchange, gel filtration, and ATP-affinity chromatography and the NH2-terminal sequence shows > 95% homology to E. coli GroEL. This GroEL homologue is found in the SAM of A. actinomycetemcomitans but is not found in the osteolytically active SAM from other Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. The GroEL protein from E. coli, but not from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, also showed activity in the bone resorption assay. We believe this to be the first observation that a molecular chaperone has the capacity to stimulate the breakdown of connective tissue.
TI  - Molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kDa protein of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The 64-kDa protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4. Determination of the N-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a GroEL-like protein. The DNA fragment containing the groEL gene of A. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the groESL operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from A. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the 64-kDa protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kDa proteins of Haemophilus aphrophilus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus paraphrophilus, Escherichia coli and Eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. It is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kDa protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.
TI  - Mutational analysis of the putative leukotoxin transport genes in Actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The periodontal pathogen, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, produces leukotoxin, a protein that specifically lyses host defense cells. The leukotoxin is similar in sequence and operon organization to the Escherichia coli alpha-hemolysin and other members of the RTX family of toxins. However, unlike the other RTX toxins, the A. actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin is not secreted from the cell and instead remains associated with the outer membrane. Nonetheless, the A. actinomycetemcomitans Ikt operon contains two genes, IktB and IktD, that appear analagous to the toxin localization genes found in the other Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, to determine the roles of these putative transport genes in A. actinomycetemcomitans, we have used insertional mutagenesis to generate mutant strains lacking functional LktB and/or LktD. When either IktD or both IktB and IktD were inactivated, the level of detectable leukotoxin protein in the cell decreased significantly. However, the IktB and IktD mutations had no effect on the levels of leukotoxin RNA. Thus, the lack of LktB and LktD proteins must affect LktA synthesis post-transcriptionally. It is proposed that this is an indirect effect of leukotoxin mislocalization in IktB- and IktD- mutants. Finally, analysis of the mutants revealed that LktB and LktD are not essential for the formation of extracellular membrane vesicles in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Differential expression of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 in human monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from different microbes.
AB  - Macrophages respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and activate several host defense functions through production of mediators. However, it is not clear whether the degree of macrophage responsiveness to different sources of LPS is equivalent to or varies with the source of LPS. Therefore, in this report, we examined the extent of the human monocyte response to LPS derived from two oral pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). Additionally, due to its well-established ability to activate monocytes, we used LPS from Escherichia coli (Ec). Human monocytes, when activated with a specific source of LPS, exhibited rapid expression of mRNA for IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-8, which was followed by IL-6, as measured by RNA-PCR. Moreover, the expression of mRNA for these cytokines was followed by cytokine synthesis. Monocytes from the same subject, when activated with LPS from Pg, Aa, or Ec expressed quantitatively different levels of mRNA and proteins for all four cytokines. A given LPS induced either high or low expression of the battery of cytokines tested, indicating that the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines may be regulated by a single or a cluster of gene(s). However, no apparent differences in the time course of mRNA expression for these cytokines were observed in response to any of the LPS tested. Furthermore, the relative ability of the different sources of LPS to induce mRNA for cytokines varied throughout a wide range of LPS concentrations. This suggests that differences exist in the sensitivity of monocytes to a specific LPS, rather than in the kinetics of the secretory process itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens prime neutrophils for enhanced respiratory burst: differential effect of a synthetic lipid a precursor IVA (LA-14-PP).
AB  - When neutrophils are incubated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), they become primed for enhanced release of superoxide anion (O2-) in response to stimulation by FMLP. We investigated the human neutrophil-priming activity of LPS from the periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) in comparison with that of LPS from Escherichia coli (E. coli). The optimum conditions for LPS to prime neutrophils were assessed for every LPS and found to be as follows: Neutrophils were incubated with LPS in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated plasma and 1 mM EDTA at 37 degrees C for 30 min and then stimulated with 1 microM FMLP at 37 degrees C for 7 min. Under these conditions, half-maximum priming was observed at 6.2 ng/ml Pg-LPS, 45 ng/ml Pi-LPS, 1.5 ng/ml Aa-LPS and 1.5 ng/ml E. coli-LPS. The priming activity of each LPS was neutralized by polymyxin B. Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody inhibited priming by all LPS. The priming by Aa-LPS and E. coli-LPS was inhibited by LA-14-PP, a synthetic lipid A precursor IVA, but that by Pg-LPS and Pi-LPS was not. Priming by tumor necrosis factor alpha was not affected by polymyxin B, anti-CD14 antibody or LA-14-PP. Gelation of Limulus amebocyte lysate occurred at 10 pg/ml Pg-LPS, 30 pg/ml Pi-LPS, 3 pg/ml Aa-LPS and 3 pg/ml E. coli-LPS. Thus LPS from different periodontal pathogens primed neutrophils with different efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of an immunoglobulin Fc receptor of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses proteins that bind to the Fc portion of immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin Fc receptors on the surface of A. actinomycetemcomitans were detected by the binding of biotinylated human or murine Fc molecules to strain SUNY 465 adsorbed to the bottom of microtiter wells. Biotinylated Fc binding was inhibited by unlabeled Fc molecules and human plasma. Fc receptors were identified by the binding of biotinylated Fc molecules to bacterial membrane proteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Multiple bands were identified, and the major Fc-binding protein was determined to be a heat-modifiable protein. This protein migrated with approximate molecular weights of 25,000 and 32,000 (unheated and heated, respectively). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of this protein revealed a sequence identical to the heat-modifiable protein described for A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718. This protein sequence exhibits significant homology with the N termini of outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia coli and related OmpA-like proteins from other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Regulation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin expression: analysis of the promoter regions of leukotoxic and minimally leukotoxic strains.
AB  - The leukotoxin of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been implicated as a virulence determinant in various human infections and is encoded by a multigene operon consisting of four known genes, designated ltxC, ltxA, ltxB, and ltxD. The ltx operon appears to be present in all A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, but levels of toxin expression vary greatly among strains. Thus, to gain a better understanding of the expression and regulation of the ltx operon, we have analyzed the ltx promoters of a highly toxic (JP2) and a minimally toxic (652) strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans. The nucleotide sequence of the JP2 ltx promoter contains -10 and -35 elements situated 350 bases upstream of ltxC, and primer extension of JP2 RNA confirmed that they are functional in vivo. However, a second primer extension product of 40 bases was present, and analysis of a series of truncated JP2 promoters fused to lacZ suggested that the region immediately upstream of ltxC also promotes transcription in Escherichia coli. These results suggest that two promoters may direct ltx expression in JP2. In addition, a small open reading frame capable of encoding a peptide of 78 amino acids was identified upstream of ltxC. Northern blots showed that this open reading frame is transcribed as part of a 4.2-kb mRNA, a transcript not previously identified as being derived from the ltx operon. In contrast, strain 652 expresses low steady-state levels of ltx mRNA, and its intact ltx promoter was inefficient in transcribing lacZ in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of the 652 promoter is similar to that of the JP2 promoter but contains a region of 530 bp that is not present in JP2. Of 15 additional strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans that were analyzed, 13 contained promoters resembling the 652 sequence and 2 possessed JP2-like promoters. Both strains possessing the JP2-like promoter expressed 10- to 20-fold-higher levels of leukotoxin than did the strains possessing promoters resembling the 652 promoter. These results suggest that high levels of leukotoxin expression may correlate with the presence of the JP2-like promoter.
TI  - Characterization of plasmid pVT745 isolated from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - A 25.1-kb plasmid, pVT745, was isolated from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain VT745. This plasmid hybridized under stringent conditions to chromosomal DNA from 15 A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates obtained from geographically diverse regions of the United States. Southern blot analyses of HincII-digested A. actinomycetemcomitans genomic DNA revealed five strain-specific patterns of hybridization, which clearly indicated that intact pVT745 was not inserted into any of the genomes. Plasmid pVT745 was digested with BamHI and PstI into three, non-overlapping fragments of approximately 7.0, 8.0, and 10.0 kb. The fragments were cloned in Escherichia coli on the low copy number vector pGB2. Although these three fragments exhibited no cross-hybridization, genomic DNA from isolates representing each of the strain-specific patterns hybridized with two or three of the cloned fragments. The results suggest that two or more unique sequences within pVT745 also may be present in genomic DNA obtained from various strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of broad-host-range incompatibility group P and Q plasmids from Escherichia coli to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The first example of conjugal transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli to the periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is presented. Derivatives of the incompatibility group P (IncP) plasmid RK2 successfully transferred from an E. coli donor to an A. actinomycetemcomitans recipient. The resulting A. actinomycetemcomitans transconjugants transferred the plasmids back to E. coli recipients. The IncP transfer functions were also used in trans to mobilize the IncQ plasmid pBK1 from E. coli to A. actinomycetemcomitans. The IncP and IncQ plasmids both transferred into A. actinomycetemcomitans at high frequencies (0.3 to 0.5 transconjugants per donor) and showed no gross deletions, insertions, or rearrangements. Determinations of MICs of various antibiotics for the A. actinomycetemcomitans transconjugant strains demonstrated the expression of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin resistance determinants.
TI  - Ribotyping shows intrafamilial similarity in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans isolates.
AB  - This study reports ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns of 54 Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans isolates obtained from 9 families (12 children and 11 parents). The isolates represented serotypes a, b, c and d. The chromosomal DNA extracted from A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates was digested with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, ClaI and Bg/I. The DNA fragments were hybridized to the rrnB ribosomal RNA operon of the Escherichia coli chromosome. In 5 families, isolates belonging to the same family (mother and/or father and the children) had identical hybridization patterns when analyzed with all 5 enzymes. In 3 families, each family member harbored only one ribotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans, but at least one member harbored isolates that were of a different ribotype than the other members of the family. In one family, the mother harbored 2 ribotypes (and serotypes), one common with the daughter and one different. In conclusion, the study confirms the previous results that A. actinomycetemcomitans is transmitted intrafamilially.
TI  - Characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  - Three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. Twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Prevotella, and Actinobacillus). Nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four Prevotella denticola strains, two Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of P. melaninogenica, Streptococcus constellatus, and A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. Incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. With one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the S. constellatus isolate. Genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in Escherichia coli using pBR322. Hemolytic clones were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). Extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three P. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. Two of the P. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 Kb inserts. The clone derived from the third strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 Kb region, but the flanking DNA showed no homology even though all three P. denticola isolates were shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification of plasmids in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and construction of intergeneric shuttle plasmids.
AB  - A collection of 39 isolates of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, obtained from laboratories located in 5 different geographical regions of the United States, was examined for the presence of plasmid DNA. Only 2 of the strains examined, designated VT736 and VT745, harbored detectable plasmids. Strain VT736 contained a 1.9 kb plasmid species (pVT736-1) and a larger ( > 30 kb) species (pVT736-2). Both plasmids were detected in the covalently closed circular DNA fraction of dye buoyant density gradients. However, only the smaller plasmid was observed in agarose gels containing plasmid-enriched cell lysates prepared by a rapid screening procedure. Strain VT745 contained a single, 24 kb, plasmid (pVT745) that was observed consistently in plasmid-enriched lysates, as well as in the plasmid band of dye buoyant density gradients. A restriction endonuclease map of pVT736-1 was constructed. The plasmid contained one site each for the enzymes HincII, KpnI and XhoI, located 600 to 700 bp from each other on the pVT736-1 map. HincII-digested pVT736-1 DNA could not be cloned in Escherichia coli. However, intact pVT736-1 digested with KpnI or XhoI could be cloned in E. coli on pUC19 or pGEM7Zf(-), respectively. KpnI-digested pVT736-1 was cloned in both orientations on pUC19, but XhoI-digested pVT736-1 was clonable in only one orientation on pGEM7Zf(-). Each of the 3 types of chimeric plasmid constructs provided a potential A. actinomycetemcomitans/E. coli shuttle plasmid for the development of a genetic transfer system in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Hybridization patterns of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a-e detected with an rRNA gene probe.
AB  - This study reports a genetic characterization of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains in relation to serotypes by using rRNA gene restriction patterns. Eighty-eight clinical strains were isolated from 20 unrelated subjects at one or several occasions. The strains were serotyped by using serotype-specific rabbit antisera against serotypes a, b, c, d or e. Three subjects harbored 2 A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes, 15 subjects 1 serotype and 2 subjects untypable strains. Chromosomal DNA was digested with restriction endonuclease ClaI, BamHI, BglI or HindIII and hybridized to the rrnB ribosomal RNA operon of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Isolates belonging to the same serotype were genetically identical in the same individual but nonidentical if they belonged to different serotypes. Isolates of the same or different serotypes were genetically nonidentical in different individuals. The banding patterns of A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates recovered from the same individuals during several years always remained identical. The hybridization method using pKK3535 as a probe seemed suitable as an epidemiological tool for comparing the clonal identity of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains.
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Identification and analysis of the gap region in the 23S ribosomal RNA from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative coccobacillus which can cause certain severe extra-oral infections as well as forms of human periodontal disease such as localized juvenile periodontitis. In contrast to many prokaryotic and eukaryotic species which exhibit an intact 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecule, examination of six A. actinomycetemcomitans strains--including three serogroup representative strains and two strains from non-human primates--revealed that this micro-organism does not produce an intact 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecule but, rather, two smaller forms of 1.8 kb and 1.2 kb designated as 23S alpha and 23S beta fragments. On the other hand, 14 other strains of Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella species demonstrated intact 23S rRNA. The sequence of the region of the 23S rRNA gene in A. actinomycetemcomitans strain ATCC 43718 containing the cleavage site was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing, while the location of the 3' and 5' termini of the 23S alpha and 23S beta fragments was resolved by S1 nuclease mapping and cDNA primer-extension. A deletion of 112 bases was noted in comparisons of base sequences from A. actinomycetemcomitans rRNA and rDNA. The DNA intervening sequence was localized to nucleotide 1180 of the Escherichia coli 23S rRNA map. While the primary structure of the gap region showed little homology with the gap regions described in other organisms, the secondary structure was similar to that previously described in the parasitic helminth Schistosoma japonicum. Restriction enzyme and nucleotide sequence analysis of the gap region in eight other A. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed it to be highly conserved.
TI  - Transformation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by electroporation, utilizing constructed shuttle plasmids.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a periodontal pathogen, has been strongly implicated in human periodontal disease. Advances in the molecular analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence factors have been limited due to the unavailability of systems for genetic transfer, transposon mutagenesis, and gene complementation. Slow progress can be traced almost exclusively to the lack of gene vector systems and methods for the introduction of DNA into A. actinomycetemcomitans. An electrotransformation system that allowed at least five strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans to be transformed with stable shuttle plasmids which efficiently replicated in both Escherichia coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans was developed. One plasmid, a potential shuttle vector designated pDL282, is 5.7 kb in size, has several unique restriction enzyme sites, and codes for resistance to spectinomycin and ampicillin. E. coli and A. actinomycetemcomitans were transformed with equal efficiencies of approximately 10(5) transformants per micrograms of DNA. Similar transformation efficiencies were obtained whether the plasmid DNA was isolated from A. actinomycetemcomitans or E. coli. In addition, frozen competent cells of A. actinomycetemcomitans yielded comparable efficiencies of transformation. Restriction enzyme analysis of pDL282 isolated after transformation confirmed the presence of intact donor plasmids. A plasmid isolated from A. pleuropneumoniae was also capable of transforming some isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, although generally at a lower frequency. The availability of these shuttle plasmids and an efficient transformation procedure should significantly facilitate the molecular analysis of virulence factors of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - The regulatory effects of monocytes on human natural killer cells activated by lipopolysaccharides.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) rapidly enhance cytotoxicity of human natural killer (NK) cells against tumor targets. The regulatory effects of peripheral blood monocytes (MO) on this activation were measured. When lymphocytes were kept at a constant number in culture containing LPS from oral and enteric bacteria, increasing the percentage of MO caused a dose-dependent suppression of NK cytotoxicity. This suppression was reversed by adding the prostaglandin (PG) inhibitor indomethacin which indicates that PGE was released by MO stimulated by LPS. PGE is known to suppress NK activity by its effects on cAMP. MO separated from lymphocytes by transwell membranes also suppressed NK cells in the presence of LPS but this action was again reversed by indomethacin. This suggests that cell-to-cell contact is not necessary for MO to suppress NK cytotoxicity when stimulated by LPS. The role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in NK suppression was studied. Antibodies to IL-1 and TNF did not alter the suppression mediated by MO on NK activity. Adding IL-1 or TNF to cell cultures without MO or LPS had no effect on NK activity after 24 h. TNF, but not IL-1, enhanced NK activity in the presence of LPS in cultures without MO. When PGE was preincubated with only lymphocytes for 2 h, the activating effects of a secondary stimulation, interleukin-2 (IL-2), were inhibited. IL-1 had no effect on IL-2 activation when pre-incubated with PBL but TNF slightly enhanced IL-2-induced NK cytotoxicity.
TI  - Analysis of in vitro lymphoproliferative responses and antibody formation following subcutaneous injection of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Wolinella recta in a murine model.
AB  - The potential of Wolinella recta and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to cause abscesses and induce an immune response was tested in BALB/c mice. Mice were injected subcutaneously with W. recta, A. actinomycetemcomitans or a mixture of these 2 microorganisms. Mice injected with A. actinomycetemcomitans alone, or with both organisms, demonstrated abscesses at the injection site 2 days later, from which pure cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans were isolated. Mice injected with W. recta had small, flat abscesses at the injection site from which no bacteria could be cultured. W. recta was cultured from injection sites only when associated with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Mice developed positive serum IgG antibody responses to W. recta by 20 days post-injection but not to A. actinomycetemcomitans whether injected in pure culture or mixed infection. In vitro lymphoproliferative responses following injection of W. recta and/or A. actinomycetemcomitans resulted in increased lymphocyte reactivity in unstimulated cultures and decreased in vitro responses to phytohemagglutinin. In vitro lymphoproliferative responses to Escherichia coli LPS or Salmonella typhimurium LPS were depressed in mice injected with A. actinomycetemcomitans, but not in mice injected with W. recta.
TI  - [Effect of lipopolysaccharide on biological properties and induction of alveolar  bone resorption in rats].
AB  - A study was made on the effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans on mitogenic response and the release of calcium from mouse calvaria. LPS exhibited significant mitogenic activity on mouse spleen cells, and increased the release of calcium from mouse calvaria in vitro. The effect of LPS from E. coli on alveolar bone resorption in Wistar male rats was also studied. LPS was infused by an Alzet miniosmotic pump that was implanted subcutaneously on the backs of the rats. A catheter connected to the pump was brought up to the maxillary right second molar using a nylon ligature. In this way the rats were continuously infused for 7 days with LPS. Alveolar bone loss was measured by an image-analyser (Nexus 6411). Rats stimulated by LPS exhibited significant alveolar bone loss, but bone loss was not observed in rats stimulated by saline. Polymyxin B effectively inhibited the LPS-stimulated bone resorption.
