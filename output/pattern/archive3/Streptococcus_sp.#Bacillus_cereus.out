antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of sheopur (a city of central india).
the main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of sheopur district, madhya pradesh, india. these samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. these isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. antibacterial activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. isolates as14, as27, and as28 were highly active, while as1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. isolate as7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus (24 mm) and as16 showed the highest activity against enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). mic was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. mic of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against shigella dysenteriae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus xylosus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. all actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, while they showed less activity against s. dysenteriae. these isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
to study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. the microbiological quality of honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. the bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. all honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.
evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the methylene chloride extract of miconia ligustroides, isolated triterpene acids, and ursolic acid derivatives.
the methylene chloride extract of miconia ligustroides (dc.) naudin (melastomataceae), the isolated compounds ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of these acids, and ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: bacillus cereus (atcc 14579), vibrio cholerae (atcc 9458), salmonella choleraesuis (atcc 10708), klebsiella pneumoniae (atcc 10031), and streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc 6305). the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the methylene chloride extract showed no activity against the selected microorganisms. ursolic acid was active against b. cereus, showing a mic value of 20 microg/ml. oleanolic acid was effective against b. cereus and s. pneumoniae with a mic of 80 microg/ml in both cases. the mixture of triterpenes, ursolic and oleanolic acids, did not enhance the antimicrobial activity. however, the acetyl and methyl ester derivatives, prepared from ursolic acid, increased the inhibitory activity for s. pneumoniae.
molecular cloning of cdnas encoding antimicrobial peptide precursors from the skin of the chinese brown frog, rana chensinensis.
skin plays a key role in the daily survival of amphibians. in the present study,  six cdnas encoding amphibian skin antimicrobial peptide precursors from the chinese brown frog rana chensinensis, were cloned and identified as preprobrevinin-1cec, preprobrevinin-1ceb, preprotemporin-1cea, preprotemporin-1ceb, preprotemporin-1cec, and preprochensinin-1. preprotemporin-1cea, ceb, and cec are members of the temporin family, which are usually short, hydrophobic, and c-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial peptides. preprobrevinin-1cea and ceb were identified as members of the brevinin-1 family of antimicrobial peptides, because both peptides contain a "rana box" that is responsible for forming c-terminal cys-bridged cyclic heptapeptides. the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of preprochensinin-1 were not similar to any known amphibian skin defensive peptides. four bioactive peptides were chemically synthesized according to the deduced amino acid sequences of six prepropeptides from r. chensinensis skin, and their antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and haemolytic properties were evaluated. all of the synthesized peptides inhibited the growth of gram-positive bacteria. brevinin-1cea showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. the novel amphibian skin peptide chensinin-1 was active against bacillus cereus and streptococcus lactis at a concentration of 11.6 microm, but did not inhibit the growth of mcf-7 and hela cells at 200 microm, and had no haemolytic activity at a concentration of 500 microm. temporin-1cea exhibited the greatest ability to inhibit the growth of mcf-7 cells. its antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities may be due to its high degree of alpha-helical confirmation and amphipathic nature.
mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

the antimicrobial activity of the chloroform, diethyl ether, acetone, petroleum ether, and ethanol extracts of the lichen cladonia foliacea and its (-)-usnic acid, atranorin, and fumarprotocetraric acid constituents against 9 bacteria and fungi has been investigated. the extracts and pure compounds alone were found active against the same bacteria and the same yeasts. bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, proteus vulgaris, listeria monocytogenes, aeromonas hydrophila, candida albicans, and candida glabrata growth were inhibited. in addition, the mics of the extracts, (-)-usnic acid, atranorin and fumarprotocetraric acid were determined.
phytoestrogen genistein as an anti-staphylococcal agent.
the soybean-derived isoflavone genistein has been shown to exert beneficial effects on many disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. the effects of genistein on mammalian cells are mediated by its abilities to inhibit topoisomerase ii and protein tyrosine kinase. in order to examine the potential antibacterial activities of genistein, we incubated the bacteria with various concentrations of this compound for different periods of time and assessed the viable counts. exposure to genistein exhibited an inhibitory effect on all staphylococcal strains tested, including methicillin-resistant strains. furthermore, the growth of streptococcus pasteurianus, bacillus cereus, and helicobacter pylori was clearly inhibited by genistein, whereas escherichia coli growth was not suppressed. daidzein, which is structurally similar to genistein, but deficient in topoisomerase ii inhibitory activity, also inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, albeit with lower potency than genistein. our results indicate that genistein exerts potent antibacterial properties in vitro, which are possibly mediated by the stabilization of the covalent topoisomerase ii-dna cleavage complex.
antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
antimicrobial potency of the leaf - stalk extract of curcuma longa (linn).
the methanolic extract of the leaf-stalk of curcuma longa linn, was tested for its minimum inhibitor concentration (mic) against gram positive-staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilus, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pnemoniae, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative e.coli, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and vibrio cholerae strains, further, the ones of inhibition produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
antibacterial activity of orobanche cernua extract.
the effect of the parasitic plant orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; streptococcus sp.-3125; streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for bacillus cereus and escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. data indicated that the mic of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against streptococcus sp. and s. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against s. pyogenes and b. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against e. coli. it can be concluded that the o. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and staphylococcus.
isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin against clinical bacterial isolates from patients with cancer.
the antibacterial activity of trovafloxacin was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin and norfloxacin against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer. in general, the activity of trovafloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and sparfloxacin against most gram-negative isolates tested (minor differences in the activity of each agent against individual species were seen) and it was the most active agent tested against stenotrophomonas maltophilia, inhibiting 80% of these isolates at <2.0 mg/l. trovafloxacin was also the most active agent tested against gram-positive organisms, including ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains and most ciprofloxacin- and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. it was much more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci, and was also active against bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes, inhibiting all isolates at a concentration of <0.5 mg/l.
structure-activity relationships in a series of substituted indolocarbazoles: topoisomerase i and protein kinase c inhibition and antitumoral and antimicrobial properties.
a series of compounds structurally related to staurosporine, rebeccamycin, and corresponding aglycones was synthesized, and their activities toward protein kinase c and topoisomerases i and ii were tested together with their in vitro antitumor efficiency against murine b16 melanoma and p388 leukemia cells. their antimicrobial activities were also examined against a gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli), a yeast (candida albicans), and three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, streptomyces chartreusis, and streptomyces griseus). to avoid side effects expected with protein kinase c inhibitors, we introduced substitution on the maleimide nitrogen and/or a sugar moiety linked to one of the indole nitrogens to obtain specific inhibitors of topoisomerase i with minimal activities on protein kinase c. as expected, these structures were inefficient on topoisomerase ii, and some of them exhibited a strong activity against topoisomerase i. generally, dechlorinated compounds were found to be more active than chlorinated analogues against both purified topoisomerase i and protein kinase c. on the other hand, opposite results were obtained in the cell antiproliferative assays. these results suggest lack of cell membrane permeability in the absence of the chlorine residue or cleavage of carbon-chlorine bonds inside the cell.
dicranin, an antimicrobial and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor from the moss dicranum scoparium.
extracts of nine mosses, collected in switzerland, were screened for antimicrobial, antioxidative, and 15-lipoxygenase (15-lpo) inhibitory activities. the ch2cl2 extract of dicranum scoparium was found to possess pronounced antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. in addition, inhibition of soybean 15-lpo occurred at very low concentration. phytochemical investigation of this extract afforded z,z,z-octadeca-6-yne-9,12,15-trienoic acid [1] by a combination of chromatographic techniques. this compound, named dicranin [1], was found to be responsible for most of the biological activity. the strongest antimicrobial effect was observed against streptococcus faecalis (disc diffusion assay). in contrast to the ch2cl2 extract of d. scoparium, dicranin was inactive against e. coli. dicranin was identified by ir, ms, and nmr spectroscopy. a 2d inadequate experiment confirmed the structure and yielded the assignment of all 13c-nmr signals.
effects of lactic acid bacteria and organic acids on growth and germination of bacillus cereus.
growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of bacillus cereus were affected by streptococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by b. cereus. b. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 cfu/ml when cells were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of b. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 m) completely inactivated multiplication of b. cereus at ph 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. spores of b. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 m) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at ph 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.
isolation and preliminary characterization of streptococcus cremoris (strain 202) bacteriocin.
ability to produce bacteriocin (lactostrepcin) is demonstrated in streptococcus cremoris. however, lactostrepcin was found to be produced by only one strain (strain 202) out of the 17 s. cremoris strains tested. this bacteriocin is preliminarily characterized, it differs from other lactic streptococci bacteriocins. the strain 202 bacteriocin acts on many strains of lactic streptococci, strains of bacillus cereus, and some strains of leuconostoc and lactobacillus. it was shown that strain 202 contains some plasmids, but we were not able by preliminary observations to prove the plasmid localization of the determinant(s) for lactostrepcin production by this strain. in persistent lactostrepcin-negative variants of strain 202, in comparison with the parental strain, the plasmid pattern may be changed or unchanged.
mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from streptomyces viridans.
the free ligand, deferroviridomycin a, and its iron(ii) complex, viridomycin a, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-n3,o4)ferrate(ii), respectively. we investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(ii), tris cobalt(iii), and tris nickel(ii) complexes against escherichia coli nihj, salmonella typhimurium lt-2z, staphylococcus aureus 209p, streptococcus faecium 10541, and bacillus cereus, t. the free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(ii) and cobalt(iii) complexes displayed activity only against s. aureus and b. cereus. the antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. the mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against e. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.
effects of local anesthetics on bacterial cells.
the membrane effects of chlorpromazine, nupercain, tetracain, and procain were studied using bacillus cereus, b. megaterium, b. subtilis, and streptococcus faecalis, protoplasts from s. faecalis, and isolated membranes from b. subtilis. chlorpromazin, nupercain, and tetracain produced characteristic micromorphological alterations after treatment for 5 to 30 min at ph 7.0 and 20 degrees c; the membrane staining pattern changed from asymmetric to symmetric, complex mesosome-like structures appeared, and membrane fractures and solubilization occurred. procain at concentrations up to 100 mm did not induce detectable alterations. protoplasts were quickly lysed by 10 mm tetracain. a rapid and extensive leakage of k+ was induced by chlorpromazin, nupercain, and tetracain. procain (100 mm) induced a slight k+ leakage. the membrane respiratory activity of intact b. cereus cells (as measured by the triphenyl tetrazolium reduction) and the succinic dehydrogenase activity of b. subtilis isolated membranes were found to be inhibited by the four local anesthetics. the concentrations that produced 50% inhibition of those activities are correlated with the hydrophobicities of the anesthetic molecules.
photobiological behaviour of bacteria and phages supplemented with aza-analogoues of nucleic acid bases.
the photochemical stability of anomalous nucleic acid bases of the azatype, 5-azacytosine (i), 5-azacytidine (ii), 6-azacytosine (iii), 6-azacytidine (iv), 6-azathymine (v), 6-azauracil (vi), and 8-aza-adenine (vii) to u. v. light of the wavelength 254 nm differs from the u. v. stability of the normal constituents. changes of the u.v. inactivation of escherichia coli k12 c600, e. coli b, bacillus cereus, as well as e. coli phages gamma cb2 and gamma b2b5 supplemented with azaderivatives prior to irradiation were investigated. it was found that i, ii, iii, iv, and vii are more, v and vi less sensitive to u. v. light compared with corresponding natural nucleic acid bases. their changed u. v. sensitivities are reflected in the survival curves after u. v. -irradiation in as far as azabases are incorporated into the nucleic acids in vivo. this explains the increase in u.v. sensitivity of e. coli k12 c600, e. coli b, and b. cereus supplemented with i, ii, iii, iv, and vii and the decrease in u.v. sensitivity of streptococcus faecalis supplemented with v (the latter information was taken from gunther and prusoff 1967). the lack of any significant influence on inactivation curves of e. coli k12 c600 by v and vi, and on e. coli phages gamma cb2 and gamma c2b5 by ii, is discussed in terms of too small incorporation rates. no discrimination was put forward with respect to dna and rna incorporation.
characteristics of a bacteriocin derived from streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes antagonistic to diplococcus peumoniae.
a bacteriocin-producing strain of streptococcus faecalis var. zymogenes (e-1) was isolated from clinical material (conjunctiva). the active substance differed from bacteriocins described by other investigators primarily in its spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially by its marked inhibition of diplococcus pneumoniae. the e-1 bacteriocin also inhibited nonhemolytic strains of enterococci as well as one-third of the viridans group of streptococcal strains investigated. the degree of inhibition, however, as indicated by the size of the zones against the latter organisms, was significantly reduced. no activity was detected against any of the strains belonging to the following groups of bacteria: hemolytic enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and various gram-negative species. similarly, three strains each of bacillus cereus and listeria monocytogenes and one strain of erysipelothrix insidiosa were not inhibited. the bacteriocin was able to diffuse through bacterial membranes as well as cellulose dialyzer tubing. it was inactivated by heating to 80 c for 20 min but resisted inactivation by either trypsin or chloroform.
