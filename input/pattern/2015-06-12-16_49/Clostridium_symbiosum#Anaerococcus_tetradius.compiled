TI  - Techniques for controlling variability in gram staining of obligate anaerobes.
AB  - Identification of anaerobes recovered from clinical samples is complicated by the fact that certain gram-positive anaerobes routinely stain gram negative; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Eubacterium plautii, Clostridium ramosum, Clostridium symbiosum, and Clostridium clostridiiforme are among the nonconformists with regard to conventional Gram-staining procedures. Accurate Gram staining of American Type Culture Collection strains of these anaerobic bacteria is possible by implementing fixing and staining techniques within a gloveless anaerobic chamber. Under anaerobic conditions, gram-positive staining occurred in all test organisms with "quick" fixing techniques with both absolute methanol and formalin. The results support the hypothesis that, when anaerobic bacteria are exposed to oxygen, a breakdown of the physical integrity of the cell wall occurs, introducing Gram stain variability in gram-positive anaerobes.
TI  - The partial amino acid sequence of the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum: implications for the evolution and structural basis of coenzyme specificity.
AB  - The amino acid sequence is reported for CNBr and tryptic peptide fragments of the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum. Together with the N-terminal sequence, these make up about 75% of the total sequence. The sequence shows extensive similarity with that of the NADP(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli (52% identical residues out of the 332 compared) allowing confident placing of the peptide fragments within the overall sequence. This demonstrated sequence similarity with the E. coli enzyme, despite different coenzyme specificity, is much greater than the similarity (31% identities) between the GDH's of C. symbiosum and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, both NAD(+)-linked. The evolutionary implications are discussed. In the 'fingerprint' region of the nucleotide binding fold the sequence Gly X Gly X X Ala is found, rather than Gly X Gly X X Gly. The sequence found here has previously been associated with NADP+ specificity and its finding in a strictly NAD(+)-dependent enzyme requires closer examination of the function of this structural motif.
TI  - The biotin-dependent sodium ion pump glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from Fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum). Comparison with the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Membrane preparations of Fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein). The enzyme was solubilized with 2% Triton X-100 in 0.5 M NaCl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-Sepharose. The activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on Na+ (Km = 3 mM) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. The glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria Acidaminococcus fermentans and Clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent Km for Na+ (1 mM) and were not stimulated by phospholipids. In addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium ion. By incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic sodium ion pump was reconstituted. The enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kDa), beta (33 kDa), gamma (19 kDa), and delta (16 kDa) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). The subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. With an antiserum directed against the decarboxylase from A. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus could be detected on Western blots.
TI  - Comparative serum bactericidal activity against test anaerobes in volunteers receiving imipenem, clindamycin, latamoxef and metronidazole.
AB  - Ten healthy volunteers received on separate days the following regimens: imipenem 500 mg, clindamycin 600 mg, latamoxef 1 g, and metronidazole 500 mg. The antibiotics were given intravenously as an infusion over 15 min. Blood samples were obtained before and 30 min, 1 and 6 h after the start of the infusion. Serum bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities were measured against the following strains of strict anaerobes: two strains of Bacteroides fragilis, one strain each of B. vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. oralis, Fusobacterium symbiosum, Eubacterium lentum, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus magnus. Sera from patients receiving clindamycin showed the highest inhibitory and bactericidal activities except against B. thetaiotaomicron and F. symbiosum. Imipenem had similar inhibitory and bactericidal activity to that shown by latamoxef. Metronidazole had a moderate activity against all strains although the activity persisted for 6 h. Latamoxef was the most active antibiotic against the test strain of C. perfringens.
TI  - A sodium ion gradient as energy source for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus.
AB  - The determination of enzymatic activities in cell-free extracts of Acidaminococcus fermentans and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus led to a refined scheme for the pathway of glutamate fermentation via (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate to acetate and butyrate. From the ratio of these products the amount of ATP generated by substrate level phosphorylation was calculated. Growth experiments with the organisms including Clostridium symbiosum and Clostridium tetanomorphum indicated that a sodium gradient contributed additional energy for growth. The high growth yields found in organisms containing the biotin dependent sodium pump glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase could be reduced by the sodium ionophor monensin. In P. asaccharolyticus energy equivalent up to 0.6 mol ATP per mol of glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylated was conserved via the Na+ gradient. The data may explain the growth promoting effects of monensin in cattle.
TI  - Urease-producing species of intestinal anaerobes and their activities.
AB  - Urease activities of anaerobic bacteria that constituted predominant gut flora were examined. It was demonstrated that some strains of Eubacterium aerofaciens, E. lentum, and Peptostreptococcus products produced urease. They were the most numerous species in human feces. All strains of Bifidobacterium infantis and some strains of Bacteroides multiacidus, B. bifidum, Clostridium symbiosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. varium, Lactobacillus fermentum, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and P. prevotii produced urease. The optimum pH of the Lactobacillus urease was found to be 4.0, whereas the pH value of B. multiacidus urease was 8.0.
