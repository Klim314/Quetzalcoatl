TI  == linum usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil: antimicrobial activity and efficacy in bovine mastitis.
AB  == purpose: in vitro antimicrobial activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of l. usitatissimum (linseed/flaxseed) fixed oil in bovine mastitis were investigated.  method: in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. usitatissimum fixed oil was evaluated against a number of microorganisms by disc diffusion method and mic determination. the in vivo efficacy of the oil was evaluated in nine mastitis-affected cows divided into three groups (three in each group), following once-a-day intramammary infusion of oil, cefoperazone or an oil-cefoperazone combination for 7 days and by monitoring the california mastitis test score, somatic cell count and microbial count in milk samples. results: the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the oil against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli was comparable to that of cefoperazone while the  antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus and candida albicans, was greater than that of cefoperazone. in the in vivo study, the oil exhibited significant reduction in the california mastitis test score and somatic cell count in milk samples from infected udders following 7 days of intramammary administration suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. the microbial count in milk samples was also reduced significantly following oil treatment. the effects were comparable to the treatment by cefoperazone (mastiwock) alone or in combination with the oil. apparently, the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the oil contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in mastitis; the oil could be used as an alternative treatment for bovine mastitis conclusion: the results suggest possible therapeutic potential of l. usitatissimum fixed oil in bovine mastitis.

TI  == production and properties of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from the swine pathogen streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major pathogen found in the upper respiratory  tract of swine. in this study, isolates of this bacterial species were tested for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis). of the 38 strains tested, four inhibited the growth of other s. suis isolates according to  a deferred-antagonism plate assay. interestingly, three of the strains were originally isolated from healthy carrier pigs and were considered nonvirulent. three isolates (94-623, 90-1330, and aah4) that produced blis in liquid broth were selected for further characterization. none of the inhibitory activities was related to the production of either organic acids or hydrogen peroxide. the blis  produced by these strains were heat stable and proteinase k, pronase, and elastase sensitive but were trypsin and chymotrypsin resistant. they were stable  at ph 2 and 12 and had molecular masses in the range of 14 to 30 kda. maximum production was observed during the mid-log phase. following a curing procedure with novobiocin, only 90-1330 lost the ability to produce blis, suggesting that the blis might be plasmid encoded. analysis of the inhibitory spectra revealed that the blis-producing strains also inhibited the growth of actinobacillus minor, actinobacillus porcinus, enterococcus durans, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.  this study reports for the first time the ability of the swine pathogen s. suis serotype 2 to produce blis with the characteristics of classic bacteriocins. further studies are required to investigate the possibility of using bacteriocin-producing strains to prevent swine infections caused by virulent strains of s. suis serotype 2.

TI  == hemolytic interactions of dermatophilus congolensis.
AB  == the strains of dermatophilus congolensis grew on blood agar with washed sheep erythrocytes with marked total hemolysis. in testing for hemolytic interactions they gave a significant synergistic effect of a characteristic shape with rhodococcus equi and streptococcus agalactiae, whereas with staphylococcus aureus producing beta hemolysin and with staphylococcus aureus producing delta hemolysin a simultaneous synergistic as well as antagonistic effect were observed. first of all a conspicuous inhibition of in the beta hemolysin zone began and then the hemolytic effect of d. congolensis was enhanced. a similar double reaction was also observed with listeria ivanovii. with delta hemolysin there was an inhibition of the hemolytic effect of d. congolensis and at the same time a synergistic effect could be observed. also d. congolensis gave a weak synergistic effect with micrococcus lylae and listeria monocytogenes, and a further weak antagonistic effect with alpha hemolysin of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus chromogenes and micrococcus luteus. no interaction of d. congolensis was established with corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.

TI  == inverse correlation in nutritionally variant streptococci between the production  of bacteriolytic activity and sensitivity to a streptococcus pyogenes bacteriocinlike inhibitory substance.
AB  == nineteen strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) were tested for bacteriolytic activity and for their production of and sensitivity to streptococcal bacteriocinlike inhibitory substances (blis). none appeared to produce blis. an inverse relationship was found between the sensitivity to blis and the production of bacteriolytic activity against micrococcus luteus. all but  one of the 14 streptococcus defectivus isolates were sensitive to the blis of s.  pyogenes p5, and these isolates were nonlytic. the five s. adjacens isolates were not sensitive to any blis tested, and all of these isolates displayed bacteriolytic activity. sensitivity to the blis of s. agalactiae p3 separated the nonlytic s. defectivus strains into two categories.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  == antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect  of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results  are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
