TI  == dna probe technology for detection of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == a 5 kb haemophilus influenzae dna fragment involved in penicillin-binding proteins expression was used as a probe for specific detection of h. influenzae strains. the 32p-labeled probe specificity was assessed by hybridization to bacterial dots and 75 strains were tested. all h. influenzae (18) and h. aegyptius (1) strains reacted very strongly with the probe. the h. influenzae serotypes tested (a, b, and non-typable strains) did not differ in their hybridization. some hybridization was also found with the 12 other haemophilus species tested as well as other pasteurellaceae such as actinobacillus lignieresii and pasteurella multocida. two other less related species (klebsiella ozaenae and providencia stuartii) also showed low hybridization. the probe detected as low as 10(5)-10(6) h. influenzae cells and 0.1 microgram of dna in a  dot sensitivity test. hybridization to electroblotted, digested dna from different species which reacted in the bacterial dot test revealed strong hybridization to h. influenzae and h. aegyptius only. this dna probe should prove useful for h. influenzae and possibly h. aegyptius detection due to its high specificity and sensitivity under stringent hybridization conditions.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
