TI  == effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  == the aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before  treatment. bacteroides ureolyticus, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci,  staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which p. intermedia, p. asaccharolytica, the p. veroralis/buccalis complex and c. ochracea were isolated. regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.
