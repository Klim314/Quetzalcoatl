TI  == [key enzymes in butanol fermentation by a facultative anaerobe bacillus sp. tsh1].
AB  == bacillus sp. tsh1 is a butanol-producing microorganism newly isolated in our laboratory; it can grow and ferment under facultative anaerobic conditions, while sharing similar fermentation pathways and products with clostridium acetobutylicum. to illustrate the relationships between the products and the enzyme activities in bacillus sp. tsh1, key butanol- and ethanol-forming enzymes  were studied, including butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, butanol dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. the activities of the three enzymes increased rapidly after the initiation of fermentation. activities of three enzymes peaked before 21 h, and simultaneously, product concentrations also began to increase gradually. the maximum activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was 0.054 u/mg at 12 h,  butyraldehyde dehydrogenase 0.035 u/mg at 21 h and butanol dehydrogenase 0.055 u/mg at 15 h. the enzyme activities then decreased, but remained constant at a low level after 24 h, while the concentrations of butanol, acetone, and ethanol continued increasing until the end of the fermentation. the results will attribute to the understanding of the butanol metabolic mechanism, and provide a  reference for further study of a facultative bacillus metabolic pathway.

TI  == purification and some properties of an alkaline xylanase from alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain 41m-1.
AB  == an alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain, 41m-1, isolated from soil produced multiple  xylanases extracellularly. one of these xylanases was purified to homogeneity by  ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. the moleculr mass of this enzyme (xylanase j) was 36 kda, and the isoelectric point was ph 5.3. xylanase j was most active at ph 9.0. the optimum temperature for the activity at ph 9.0 was around 50 degrees c. the enzyme was stable up to 55 degrees c at ph 9.0 for 30 min. xylanase j was completely inhibited by the hg2+ion and n-bromosuccinimide. the predominant products of xylan hydrolysate were xylobiose, xylotriose, and higher oligosaccharides, indicating that the enzyme was an endoxylanase. the apparent km and vmax values on xylan were 3.3 mg/ml and 1,100 micromol-1 mg-1, respectively. xylanase j showed high sequence homology with the xylanases from bacillus pumilus and clostridium acetobutylicum  in the n-terminal region. xylanase j acted on neither crystalline cellulose nor carboxymethyl cellulose, indicating a possible application of the enzyme in biobleaching processes.

TI  == electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1.
AB  == methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. the rectangular views can  be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. it is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. the estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. the enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, and escherichia coli,  which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. in view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (ec 1.1.1.1) by using the name nad-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
