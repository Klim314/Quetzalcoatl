TI  == chronic dermatitis caused by lactobacillus jensenii infection in a blue and gold  macaw (ara ararauna).
AB  == case description: a 5-year-old sexually intact female blue and gold macaw (ara ararauna) was evaluated because of a swelling on the right side of the face and irritated area on the ventral aspect of the keel. clinical findings: clinical findings were consistent with dermatitis (right facial lesion) and a coalescing subdermal granuloma (ventral keel lesion). hematologic analysis revealed monocytosis and mild anemia. histologic evaluation of the ventral keel lesion revealed evidence of chronic heterophilic dermatitis with multinucleated giant cells and bacterial rods and cocci. an unspeciated gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium was isolated via aerobic bacterial culture. results of bacterial biochemical tests suggested the organism was a type of actinomyces. a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was performed; results indicated the organism was lactobacillus jensenii. treatment and outcome: extensive surgical debridement of  the branching granuloma, which extended throughout the length of the keel, followed by long-term treatment with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin provided full  resolution of clinical signs. no recrudescence of clinical signs was evident for  up to 18 months after the initial evaluation. clinical relevance: to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of lactobacillus-associated dermatitis or subdermal granuloma in the scientific literature and the second report of l jensenii in avian species. use of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was instrumental in the identification of this fastidious organism, indicating the method's usefulness as a diagnostic tool.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria colonizing the lower airways in lung cancer patients.
AB  == anaerobes comprise most of the endogenous oropharyngeal microflora, and can cause infections of airways in lung cancer patients who are at high risk for respiratory tract infections. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency and species diversity of anaerobes in specimens from the lower airways  of lung cancer patients. sensitivity of the isolates to conventional antimicrobial agents used in anaerobe therapy was assessed. respiratory secretions obtained by bronchoscopy from 30 lung cancer patients were cultured onto wilkins-chalgren agar in anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for 72-96 hours. the isolates were identified using microtest api 20a. the minimal inhibitory concentrations for penicillin g, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, and metronidazole were determined by e-test. a total of 47 isolates of anaerobic bacteria were detected  in 22 (73.3%) specimens. more than one species of anaerobe was found in 16 (53.3%) samples. the most frequently isolated were actinomyces spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., followed by eubacterium lentum, veillonella parvula, prevotella spp., bacteroides spp., lactobacillus jensenii. among antibiotics used in the study amoxicillin/clavulanate and imipenem were the most active in vitro (0% and 2% resistant strains, respectively). the highest resistance rate was found for penicillin g and metronidazole (36% and 38% resistant strains, respectively). the results obtained confirm the need to conduct analyses of anaerobic microflora colonizing the lower respiratory tract in patients with lung cancer to monitor potential etiologic factors of airways infections, as well as to propose efficient, empirical therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
