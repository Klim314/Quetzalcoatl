identification and antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in porcine blood from industrial slaughterhouses--a preliminary study.
ninety-seven lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from slaughterhouse porcine blood in order to select autochthonous lab strains for use as biopreservatives of this by-product. they were identified by 16s rdna sequencing; and their inhibition capacity was determined against four bacterial species frequently found in contaminated blood, i.e. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens and bacillus spp. the taxonomic study showed an unexpected low diversity of lab in blood, i.e. only 8 different species were found, from which just 4, i.e. enterococcus raffinosus, lactobacillus murinus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus garvieae, amounted to more than 90% of all isolates. inhibition tests in solid culture media proved that s. aureus and bacillus spp. were inhibited by most lab strains obtained from porcine blood. e. coli was the indicator less affected by the isolated lab species. several isolates efficiently inhibited the growth of all tested indicators.
