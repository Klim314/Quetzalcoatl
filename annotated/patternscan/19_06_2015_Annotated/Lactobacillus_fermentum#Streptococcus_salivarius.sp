TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == culture-based pcr analysis of plaque samples of japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of japanese elementary school children through pcr analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. this epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 japanese elementary school  children. assessed using the cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. dna detection of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. except for s. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. caries risk assessed using cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial dna for pcr analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == expression of a streptococcal glucosyltransferase as a fusion to a solute-binding protein in lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == bspa is a non-covalently anchored cystine-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11. it has previously been used to present antigens derived from infectious organisms on the l. fermentum br11 cell surface. in this study, the capacity of bspa to present a very large polypeptide was tested. a temperature sensitive plasmid was constructed that encodes a 175-kda chimeric protein consisting of a fusion between bspa and an n-terminally truncated derivative of the streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 glucosyltransferase gtfj. this plasmid was introduced into the l. fermentum genome. integrants were able to incorporate  20-40 nmol sucrose derived glucose into glucan per ml culture per optical density unit. the glucosyltransferase activity was external to the cytoplasmic membrane and bound to the cell. unlike native bspa, the bspa-gtfj fusion could not be removed from the cell by 5 m licl wash.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  == the refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of lactobacillus fermentum, l. casei, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus,  and bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. during storage at 4 degrees c for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. after 28 days, the average numbers of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml, whereas those of l. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) cfu/ml. numbers of b. longum and l. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) cfu/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and l. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. the other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (p > 0.05) on the residual sugars. in most cases, l(+)-lactate predominated.

TI  == acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final ph recorded. most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum. streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. plaque ph was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or lactulose bp. these studies in vivo showed both lactulose and lactulose bp to exhibit low acidogenic potential. thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == production of lipoteichoic acid by lactobacilli and streptococci grown in different environments.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 and of four lactobacillus species were examined for the production of cellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acid (lta) when grown at ph 6.0 in batch culture to the stationary phase with either glucose or fructose. extracellular lta was a minor component in all cases except for l. fermentum and l. casei nird r094 grown in fructose. the total amount of lta (cellular and extracellular) produced by fructose-grown cultures was also considerably greater for these two strains, for  l. salivarius, and also two of the s. sanguis strains. growth of l. fermentum and l. casei in continuous culture in a chemostat showed that generation time and ph  of growth can influence the total amount of lta and the proportion of extracellular material. the results for glucose-limited cultures were quite disparate, with l. fermentum forming considerably more extracellular lta than l.  casei. however, in fructose-limited cultures l. fermentum formed less total lta and l. casei more so that the differences were only minor. a difference in the utilization of glucose and fructose by the heterofermentative l. fermentum and the homofermentative l. casei strains is also indicated by differences in the yield of organisms at different dilution rates in continuous culture.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  == light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. the total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. lactobacillus fermentum, l. salivarius, and streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of l. acidophilus and s. bovis. all isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
