TI  == identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  == gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. the confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular  species within this group of organisms. this investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. forty-three reference strains  of 19 prevotella and porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. the phenotypic screen easily differentiated porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. the screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to  species level with the kits. neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens. with the pcr method, pr. intermedia and pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and porph. gingivalis was readily identified. because of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, pr. melaninogenica and pr. veroralis could not be separated by the pcr method.

TI  == the tet(q) gene in bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontal disease.
AB  == twenty-two tetracycline-resistant (tetr) anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from periodontal pockets of 12 patients with refractory periodontitis were examined for the presence of the tet q determinant by dna-dna  hybridization. dot blots of bacterial dna were tested with an intragenic digoxigenin-labelled tet(q) probe consisting of a 1.45 kb ecori/pvuii fragment from plasmid pnfd13-2. southern blots of chromosomal dna digested with the restriction enzyme ecori were also examined. the tet(q) probe hybridized with dna from 8 of the 22 tetr strains, including 2 prevotella intermedia strains and one  strain each of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis  and prevotella melaninogenica. the tetr strains of mitsuokella dentalis and capnocytophaga ochracea also hybridized with the probe. the lack of discernible plasmid dna in all the probe-positive isolates suggests that these tetracycline-resistance genes were chromosomally encoded. the probe hybridized with a different size fragment in all the isolates. this study extends the number of species that carry the tet(q) gene to include several outside the genera prevotella and bacteroides.
