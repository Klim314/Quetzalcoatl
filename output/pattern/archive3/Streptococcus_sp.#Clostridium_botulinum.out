inhibition of nonproteolytic clostridium botulinum with lactic acid bacteria and  their bacteriocins at refrigeration temperatures.
nonproteolytic clostridium botulinum (strains 17b, beluga, and 202f) was found to be inhibited by lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pediococcus species in tests by the spot-on-the-lawn simultaneous-antagonism method at 10, 15, and 25 degrees c. c. botulinum 17b was the most resistant strain. inhibition zone size increased with decreasing incubation temperature. six strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and seven strains of bifidobacteria failed to produce an inhibition zone on buffered reinforced clostridium prussian blue agar seeded with spores of any of the selected c. botulinum strains. c. botulinum 17b was sensitive to 50 to 100 iu of nisin per ml and to 10 to 20 au of pediocin a per ml.
antimicrobial activity of foodborne paenibacillus and bacillus spp. against clostridium botulinum.
the saprophytic paenibacillus and bacillus spp. found in cooked chilled foods may have an effect on the growth of clostridium botulinum, a major microbiological hazard, especially for pasteurized vacuum-packaged products. culture supernatants of 200 strains of paenibacillus and bacillus strains isolated from commercial cooked chilled foods containing vegetables were screened for activity against c. botulinum type a, proteolytic type b, and type e strains in a well diffusion assay. nineteen strains were positive against c. botulinum. among those, seven paenibacillus polymyxa strains showed the highest antibotulinal activity and the largest antimicrobial spectrum against c. botulinum strains. the antibotulinal activity was evaluated throughout the growth of a representative strain of the positive p. polymyxa strains. the antimicrobial activity was detected in the culture supernatant from late-log/early stationary phase of the bacteria, which occurred after 7 to 10 days of incubation at 10 degrees c and after 2 to 3 days at 20 degrees c in nutrient broth and in vegetable purees under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. in co-cultures with the positive strain of p. polymyxa in nutrient broth and vegetable purees, a c. botulinum type e strain was inhibited whenever p. polymyxa reached stationary phase and produced its antimicrobial activity before c. botulinum began its exponential growth phase. the antimicrobial activity of p. polymyxa against c. botulinum was attributed to the production of antimicrobial peptides resistant to high temperature and acidity. other gram-positive and -negative bacteria (escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus subtilis) were also sensitive to these antimicrobial peptides.
