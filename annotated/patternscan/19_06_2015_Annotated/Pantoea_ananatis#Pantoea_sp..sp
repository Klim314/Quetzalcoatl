TI  == phosphate solubilization potential and modeling of stress tolerance of rhizobacteria from rice paddy soil in northern iran.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy soil in northern iran, and to study the effect of temperature, nacl and ph on the growth of these isolates by modeling. three of the most effective strains from a total of 300 isolates were identified and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out by 16s rdna  sequencing. the isolates were identified as pantoea ananatis (m36), rahnella aquatilis (m100) and enterobacter sp. (m183). these isolates showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity and indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. the m36, m100 and m183 isolates were able  to solubilize 172, 263 and 254 microg ml(-1) of ca3(po4)2 after 5 days of growth  at 28 degrees c and ph 7.5, and to produce 8.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mug ml(-1) of iaa when supplemented with l-tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) for 72 h, at 28 degrees c and ph 7.0, respectively. the solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associated with a drop in the ph of the culture medium and there was an inverse relationship between ph and solubilized p (r = -0.98, p < 0.0952). there were no significant differences among isolates in terms of acidity tolerance based on their confidence limits as assessed by segmented model analysis and all isolates were able to grow at ph 4.3-11 (with optimum at 7.0-7.5). based on a sigmoidal trend of a three-parameter logistic model, the salt concentration required for 50 % inhibition was 8.15, 6.30 and 8.23 % nacl for m36, m100 and m183 isolates, respectively. moreover, the minimum and maximum growth temperatures estimated by  the segmented model were 5.0 and 42.75 degrees c for m36, 12.76 and 40.32 degrees c for m100, and 10.63 and 43.66 degrees c for m183. the three selected isolates could be deployed as inoculants to promote plant growth in an agricultural environment.

TI  == production and glucosylation of c50 and c 40 carotenoids by metabolically engineered corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  == the yellow-pigmented soil bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum atcc13032 is accumulating the cyclic c50 carotenoid decaprenoxanthin and its glucosides. carotenoid pathway engineering was previously shown to allow for efficient lycopene production. here, engineering of c. glutamicum for production of endogenous decaprenoxanthin as well as of the heterologous c50 carotenoids c.p.450 and sarcinaxanthin is described. plasmid-borne overexpression of genes for lycopene cyclization and hydroxylation from c. glutamicum, dietzia sp., and micrococcus luteus, in a lycopene-producing platform strain constructed here, resulted in accumulation of these three c50 carotenoids to concentrations of about 3-4 mg/g cdw. chromosomal deletion of a putative carotenoid glycosyltransferase gene cg0730/crtx in these strains entailed production of non-glucosylated derivatives of decaprenoxanthin, c.p.450, and sarcinaxanthin, respectively. upon introduction of glucosyltransferase genes from m. luteus, c. glutamicum, and pantoea ananatis, these hydroxylated c50 carotenoids were glucosylated. we here also demonstrate production of the c40 carotenoids beta-carotene and zeaxanthin in recombinant c. glutamicum strains and co-expression of the p. ananatis crtx gene was used to obtain glucosylated zeaxanthin. together, our results show that c. glutamicum is a potentially valuable host for production of a wide range of glucosylated c40 and c50 carotenoids.

TI  == physiologic and metabolic characterization of a new marine isolate (bm39) of pantoea sp. producing high levels of exopolysaccharide.
AB  == background: marine environments are the widest fonts of biodiversity representing a resource of both unexploited or unknown microorganisms and new substances having potential applications. among microbial products, exopolysaccharides (eps) have many physiological functions and practical applications. since eps production by many bacteria is too scarce for practical use and only few species  are known for their high levels of production, the search of new high eps producers is of paramount importance. many marine bacteria, that produce eps to cope with strong environmental stress, could be potentially exploited at the industrial level. results: a novel bacterium, strain bm39, previously isolated from sediments collected in the tyrrhenian sea, was selected for its production of very high levels of eps. bm39 was affiliated to pantoea sp. (enterobacteriaceae) by 16s rrna gene sequencing and biochemical tests. according to the phylogenetic tree, this strain, being quite far from the closest known pantoea species (96% identity with p. agglomerans and p. ananatis) could belong to a new species. eps production was fast (maximum of ca. 21 g/l in 24 h on glucose medium) and mainly obtained during the exponential growth. preliminary characterization, carried out by thin layer and gel filtration chromatography, showed that the eps, being a glucose homopolymer with mw of ca. 830 kda, appeared to be different from those of other bacteria of same genus. the bacterium showed  a typical slightly halophilic behavior growing optimally at nacl 40 per thousand  (growing range 0-100 per thousand). flow cytometry studies indicated that good cell survival was maintained for 24 h at 120 per thousand. survival decreased dramatically with the increase of salinity being only 1 h at 280 per thousand. the biochemical characterization, carried out with the biolog system, showed that mb39 had a rather limited metabolic capacity. its ability, rather lower than that of p. agglomerans, was almost only confined to the metabolization of simple sugars and their derivatives. few alcohols, organic acids and nitrogen compounds  were partially used too. conclusions: strain bm39, probably belonging to a new species, due to its remarkable eps production, comparable to those of known industrial bacterial producers, could be suggested as a new microorganism for industrial applications.

TI  == isolation and characterization of indigenous endophytic bacteria associated with  leaves of switchgrass (panicum virgatum l.) cultivars.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize indigenous bacterial endophytes from cultivars  of switchgrass and study their antimicrobial and growth promoting potential. methods and results: the diversity, molecular and biochemical characterizations of indigenous and culturable bacterial endophytes residing in leaves of switchgrass have not been studied previously. this study describes the characterization of 31 bacterial endophytes from three switchgrass cutlivars: cave-in rock, blue jacket and tecumseh. molecular and phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna sequence grouped the endophytes into eight different taxa that shared high homology of 98-99% with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as microbacterium testaceum, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, bacillus subtilis and bacillus pumilus, pseudomonas fluorescens, sphingomonas parapaucimobilis, serratia sp. and pantoea ananatis. some endophytes were detected in switchgrass seeds and in plants that originated from seeds collected  a year earlier, confirming vertical transmission to the next generation of the host. selected endophytes produced cellulases and were capable of solubilizing inorganic phosphorus. analysis of cell-free culture filtrate of selected strains  using direct infusion orbitrap mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of several well-characterized lipopeptide toxins and phytohormones. re-inoculation of the roots of switchgrass seedlings with endophytes singly or combined confirmed their migration to the upper aerial parts of the plant. conclusions: our findings suggest that switchgrass leaves harbour a diversity of bacterial endophytes, some of which could potentially be applied as growth promoting bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report on the characterization of indigenous bacterial endophytes and their potential use as biofertilizers.

TI  == culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community from chungkookjang, a traditional korean fermented soybean food.
AB  == the bacterial community of chungkookjang and raw rice-straw collected from various areas in south korea was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. pure cultures were isolated from chungkookjang and raw rice-straw on tryptic soy agar plates with 72 to 121 colonies and identified  by 16s rdna gene sequence analysis, respectively. the traditional culture-based method and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of pcr-amplified 16s  rdna confirmed that pantoea agglomerans and b. subtilis were identified as predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang, respectively, from iljuk district of gyeonggi province, p. ananatis and b. licheniformis were identified as predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang from wonju district of gangwon province, and microbacterium sp. and b. licheniformis were identified as  predominant in the raw rice-straw and chungkookjang from sunchang district of jeolla province. other strains, such as bacillus, enterococcus, pseudomonas, rhodococcus, and uncultured bacteria were also present in raw rice-straw and chungkookjang. practical application: a comprehensive analysis of these microorganisms would provide a more detailed understanding of the biologically active components of chungkookjang and help improve its quality. polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis can be successfully applied to a fermented food to detect unculturable or more species than the culture-dependent method. this technique is an effective and convenient culture-independent method for studying the bacterial community in chungkookjang. in this study, the bacterial community of chungkookjang collected from various areas in south korea was investigated using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.

TI  == pantoea allii sp. nov., isolated from onion plants and seed.
AB  == eight yellow-pigmented, gram-negative, rod-shaped, oxidase-negative, motile, facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated from onion seed in south africa and from an onion plant exhibiting centre rot symptoms in the usa. the isolates were assigned to the genus pantoea on the basis of phenotypic and biochemical tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), based on gyrb, rpob, infb and atpd sequences, confirmed the allocation of the isolates to the genus pantoea. mlsa further indicated that the isolates represented a novel species, which was phylogenetically most closely related to pantoea ananatis and pantoea stewartii. amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis also placed the isolates into a cluster separate from p. ananatis and p. stewartii. compared with type strains of species of the genus pantoea that showed >97 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with strain bd 390(t), the isolates exhibited 11-55 % whole-genome dna-dna relatedness, which confirmed the classification of the isolates in a novel species. the most useful phenotypic characteristics for the differentiation of the isolates from their closest phylogenetic neighbours are production of acid from amygdalin and utilization of  adonitol and sorbitol. a novel species, pantoea allii sp. nov., is proposed, with type strain bd 390(t) ( = lmg 24248(t)).

TI  == pantoea vagans sp. nov., pantoea eucalypti sp. nov., pantoea deleyi sp. nov. and  pantoea anthophila sp. nov.
AB  == bacteria isolated from eucalyptus leaves and shoots showing symptoms of blight and die-back collected in uganda, uruguay and argentina and from maize displaying brown stalk rot symptoms in south africa were tentatively placed in the genus pantoea on the basis of phenotypic and biochemical tests. these isolates, together with two strains (lmg 2558 and lmg 2560) previously assigned to pantoea  agglomerans based on protein electrophoregrams but later excluded from this species, were further investigated using molecular techniques. 16s rrna gene sequencing and multilocus sequence analyses (mlsa) revealed that the strains were phylogenetically closely related to pantoea agglomerans, pantoea stewartii and pantoea ananatis. mlsa and amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis placed the strains into four separate clusters, not containing any of the type strains of species of the genus pantoea. dna-dna hybridization confirmed the classification of the isolates into four novel species, for which the names pantoea vagans sp. nov. (type strain r-21566t=lmg 24199t=bcc 105t=bd 765t), pantoea eucalypti sp. nov. (type strain r-25678t=lmg 24197t=bcc 076t=bd 769t), pantoea deleyi sp. nov. (type strain r-31523t=lmg 24200t=bcc 109t=bd 767t) and pantoea anthophila sp. nov. (type strain lmg 2558t=bd 871t=ncppb 1682t) are proposed.

TI  == pathway engineering of brassica napus seeds using multiple key enzyme genes involved in ketocarotenoid formation.
AB  == brassica napus (canola) plants were genetically manipulated to increase the amount and composition of carotenoids in seeds by using seven key enzyme genes involved in ketocarotenoid formation, which originated from a soil bacterium pantoea ananatis (formerly called erwinia uredovora 20d3), and marine bacteria brevundimonas sp. strain sd212 and paracoccus sp. strain n81106 (formerly called  agrobacterium aurantiacum). the seven key gene cassettes, in which each gene was  surrounded by an appropriate promoter and terminator, were connected in a tandem  manner, and the resulting constructs (17 kb) were inserted into a binary vector and used for transformation of b. napus. surprisingly, 73-85% of the regenerated  plants retained all seven genes, and formed orange- or pinkish orange-coloured seeds (embryos), while untransformed controls had light yellow-coloured seeds with predominant accumulation of lutein. three of the transgenic lines were analysed further. the total amount of carotenoids in these seeds was 412-657 microg g(-1) fresh weight, which was a 19- to 30-fold increase compared with that of untransformed controls. the total amount of ketocarotenoids was 60-190 microg  g(-1) fresh weight. beta-carotene was the predominant carotenoid, with significant amounts of alpha-carotene, echinenone, phytoene, lutein, and canthaxanthin also detected in the transgenic seeds. the ratio of hydroxylated carotenoids to overall carotenoids was quite small relative to the ratio of ketocarotenoids to overall carotenoids. interestingly, expression of many endogenous carotenogenic genes was also altered in the transgenic seeds, suggesting that their expression was affected by an increase in carotenoid biosynthesis.

TI  == biosynthesis of the vitamin e compound delta-tocotrienol in recombinant escherichia coli cells.
AB  == the biosynthesis of natural products in a fast growing and easy to manipulate heterologous host system, such as escherichia coli, is of increasing interest in  biotechnology. this procedure allows the investigation of complex natural product biosynthesis and facilitates the engineering of pathways. here we describe the cloning and the heterologous expression of tocochromanol (vitamin e) biosynthesis genes in e. coli. tocochromanols are synthesized solely in photosynthetic organisms (cyanobacteria, algae, and higher green plants). for recombinant tocochromanol biosynthesis, the genes encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  (hpd), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase (crte), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reductase (ggh), homogentisate phytyltransferase (hpt), and tocopherol-cyclase (cyc) were cloned in a stepwise fashion and expressed in e. coli. recombinant e.  coli cells were cultivated and analyzed for tocochromanol compounds and their biosynthesis precursors. the expression of only hpd from pseudomonas putida or crte from pantoea ananatis resulted in the accumulation of 336 mg l(-1) homogentisate and 84 microg l(-1) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate in e. coli cultures. simultaneous expression of hpd, crte, and hpt from synechocystis sp. under the control of single tac-promoter resulted in the production of methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-benzoquinol (67.9 microg g(-1)). additional expression of the tocopherol cyclase gene vte1 from arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the novel  formation of a vitamin e compound-delta-tocotrienol (15 microg g(-1))-in e. coli.

TI  == diversity of endophytic enterobacteria associated with different host plants.
AB  == fifty-three endophytic enterobacteria isolates from citrus, cocoa, eucalyptus, soybean, and sugar cane were evaluated for susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and kanamycin, and cellulase production. susceptibility was found on both tested antibiotics. however, in the case of ampicillin susceptibility changed according to the host plant, while all isolates were susceptible to kanamycin. cellulase production also changed according to host plants. the diversity of these isolates was estimated by employing box-pcr genomic fingerprints and 16s rdna sequencing. in total, twenty-three distinct operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by employing a criterion of 60% fingerprint similarity as a surrogate for an otu. the 23 otus belong to the pantoea and enterobacter genera, while their high diversity could be an indication of paraphyletic classification. isolates representing nine different otus belong to pantoea agglomerans, p. ananatis, p. stewartii, enterobacter sp.,  and e. homaechei. the results of this study suggest that plant species may select endophytic bacterial genotypes. it has also become apparent that a review of the  pantoea/enterobacter genera may be necessary.

TI  == bacteria associated with ectomycorrhizas of slash pine (pinus elliottii) in south-eastern queensland, australia.
AB  == bacterial communities associated with ectomycorrhizal and uncolonized roots of pinus elliottii (slash pine) collected from a plantation in south-east queensland, australia, were investigated, using cultivation-dependent and -independent methods. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of  16s rrna gene pcr products obtained using a cultivation-independent approach revealed that bacterial communities associated with ectomycorrhizal root tips differed significantly from those associated with roots uncolonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi. dgge analysis of cultivable bacterial communities revealed no significant difference between ectomycorrhizal and uncolonized roots. neither  analytical approach revealed significant differences between the bacterial communities associated with ectomycorrhizal roots colonized by a suillus sp. or an atheliaceae taxon. cloned bacterial 16s rrna genes revealed sequence types closely related with that of burkholderia phenazinium, common in both ectomycorrhizal-colonized and -uncolonized roots, while sequence types most similar to the potentially phyopathogenic bacteria burkholderia andropogonis and  pantoea ananatis were only detected in ectomycorrhizal roots. these results highlight the possibility of global movement of microorganisms, including putative pathogens, as a result of the introduction of exotic pine plantations.

TI  == characterization of bacterial beta-carotene 3,3'-hydroxylases, crtz, and p450 in  astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway and adonirubin production by gene combination in escherichia coli.
AB  == beta-carotene hydroxylase (crtz) is one of rate-limiting enzymes for astaxanthin  production. a complementation analysis was conducted using escherichia coli transformants to compare the catalytic efficiency of bacterial crtz from brevundimonas sp. sd212, paracoccus sp. pc1 (formerly known as alcaligenes sp. pc-1), paracoccus sp. n81106 (agrobacterium aurantiacum), pantoea ananatis (erwinia uredovora 20d3), marine bacterium p99-3, and p450 monooxygenase (cyp175a1) from thermus thermophilus hb27. each crtz or cyp175a1 gene was expressed in e. coli transformants synthesizing canthaxanthin and beta-carotene due to the respective presence of plasmids pac-cantha and paccar16deltacrtx. the  carotenoids that accumulated in the resulting recombinant e. coli cells were examined by chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses. e. coli carrying brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz showed the highest astaxanthin production efficiency among the transformants examined, while there was no significant difference in the catalytic efficiency for conversion from beta-carotene to zeaxanthin. recombinant e. coli expressing the cyp175a1 gene, in addition to the genes for canthaxanthin synthesis, surprisingly accumulated adonirubin (phoenicoxanthin) as the main product, although the other recombinant e. coli did not accumulate any adonirubin. the present results suggest that the brevundimonas sp. sd212 crtz and t. thermophilus hb27 cyp175a1 genes could, respectively, be used for the efficient production of astaxanthin and adonirubin in heterologous hosts.

TI  == characterization of microbial contamination in united states air force aviation fuel tanks.
AB  == bacteria and fungi, isolated from united states air force (usaf) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (gc-fame) profiling and 16s or 18s rrna gene sequencing. thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated usaf bases were collected. at each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. twelve genera, including four bacillus species and two staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. of the organisms identified, bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, sphinogmonas sp., staphylococcus sp., and the fungus aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples. the bacteria pantoea ananatis, arthrobacter sp., alcaligenes sp., kocuria rhizophilia, leucobacter komagatae, dietza sp., and the fungus discophaerina fagi have not been previously reported in usaf aviation fuel. only at two bases were the same organisms isolated from all three sample points in the fuel supply distribution chain. isolation of previously undocumented organisms suggests either, changes in aviation fuel microbial community in response to changes in aviation fuel composition, additives and biocide use, or simply, improvements in isolation and  identification techniques.
