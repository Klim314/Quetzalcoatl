TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == two genes for carbohydrate catabolism are divergently transcribed from a region of dna containing the hexc locus in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1.
AB  == the hexc locus of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 was localized to a 247-bp segment of chromosomal dna on the multicopy broad-host-range vector pro1614. the presence of this plasmid (ppz196) in strain pao1 produced the so-called "hexc effect," a two- to ninefold increase in the activities of four carbohydrate catabolism enzymes, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. the extent of the hexc effect was restricted, since three independently regulated metabolic enzymes were not affected by the presence of the hexc plasmid. furthermore, the hexc-containing plasmid did not suppress catabolite repression control. nucleotide sequence analysis of the segment of dna encompassing hexc revealed a 128-bp region rich in adenosine-plus-thymine (at) content separating two divergent open reading frames (orfs). transcriptional start sites for these two genes were mapped to the intergenic region, demonstrating that this sequence contained overlapping divergent promoters. the intergenic region contained potential regulatory sequences such as dyad symmetry motifs, polydeoxyadenosine tracts, and a sequence matching the integration host factor recognition site in escherichia coli. one of the orfs encoded a 610-amino-acid protein with 55 to 60% identity to 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase from e. coli and zymomonas mobilis. the second orf coded for a protein of 335 amino acids that displayed 45 to 60% identity to the nad-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap) family of enzymes. the nad-dependent gap gene on the p. aeruginosa chromosome was previously unmapped. gap was found to exhibit the hexc-dependent increase in its  basal activity, establishing it as a fifth catabolic enzyme in the multioperonic  hex regulon.

TI  == an allosterically insensitive class of cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == the key enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis in many gram-negative prokaryotes is cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. the zymomonas mobilis gene (tyrc) coding for this  enzyme was cloned in escherichia coli by complementation of a tyrosine auxotroph. the tyrc gene was 882 bp long, encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 32086 da. the z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase expressed in e. coli was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. the subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 32 kda as determined by sds/page. the ratio of the activity of arogenate dehydrogenase to that of prephenate dehydrogenase (approximately 3:1) remained constant throughout purification, and the two activities were therefore inseparable. the genetic and biochemical data obtained  demonstrated a single enzyme protein capable of catalyzing either of two reactions. km values of 0.25 mm and 0.18 mm were obtained from prephenate and l-arogenate, respectively. the km value obtained for nad+ (0.09 mm) was the same  regardless of whether the enzyme was assayed as arogenate dehydrogenase or as prephenate dehydrogenase. unlike the corresponding enzyme of pseudomonas aeruginosa or e. coli, the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase of z. mobilis lacks sensitivity to feedback inhibition by l-tyrosine. a typical nad(+)-binding domain was found to be located at the n-terminus of the protein. although the deduced amino-acid sequence of the z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase showed relatively low identity (19-32%) with the prephenate dehydrogenases of bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as with the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase components of the bifunctional t-proteins of e. coli and erwinia herbicola, a presumptive motif was identified which may correspond to critical residues of the binding site for cyclohexadienyl substrate molecules. immediately upstream of tryc a portion of a gene was sequenced and found to exhibit clearcut  homology of the deduced amino-acid sequence with the b. subtilis hish gene product. thus, the zymomonas gene organization is reminiscent of the linkage of genes encoding a tryosine-pathway dehydrogenase and a histidine-pathway aminotransferase in b. subtilis.

TI  == the entner-doudoroff pathway: history, physiology and molecular biology.
AB  == the entner-doudoroff pathway is now known to be very widely distributed in nature. biochemical and physiological studies show that the entner-doudoroff pathway can operate in a linear and catabolic mode, in a 'cyclic' mode, in a modified mode involving non-phosphorylated intermediates, or in alternative modes involving c1 metabolism and anabolism. molecular and genetic analyses of the entner-doudoroff pathway in zymomonas mobilis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa have led to an improved understanding of some fundamental aspects of metabolic controls. it can be argued that the entner-doudoroff pathway is more primitive than embden-meyerhof-parnas glycolysis.

TI  == broad host range plasmids carrying the escherichia coli lactose and galactose operons.
AB  == we have developed a number of broad-host-range plasmids that allow the expression of the escherichia coli lac operon from any cloned promoter, and the creation of  'in phase' fusions between lacz and other cloned genes. in a second series of constructions, the e. coli gal operon has been cloned into the broad-host-range vector and a plasmid carrying both the e. coli gal and lac genes is described. these plasmids have been transferred into pseudomonas aeruginosa and zymomonas mobilis and their effects on the utilisation of lactose and galactose have been investigated.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == activation of the lac genes of tn951 by insertion sequences from pseudomonas cepacia.
AB  == we have identified three transposable gene-activating elements from pseudomonas cepacia on the basis of their abilities to increase expression of the lac genes of the broad-host-range plasmid pgc91.14 (prp1::tn951). when introduced into auxotrophic derivatives of p. cepacia 249 (atcc 17616), this plasmid failed to confer the ability to utilize lactose. the lac genes of tn951 were poorly expressed in p. cepacia and were not induced by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. lac+ variants of the pgc91.14-containing  strains which formed beta-galactosidase at high constitutive levels as a consequence of transposition of insertion sequences from the p. cepacia genome to sites upstream of the lacz gene of tn951 were isolated. certain of the elements also increased gene expression in other bacteria. for example, is407 strongly activated the lacz gene of tn951 in pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli,  and is406 (but not is407) did so in zymomonas mobilis. the results indicate that  is elements from p. cepacia have potential for turning on the expression of foreign genes in a variety of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different zymomonas mobilis strains.
AB  == twenty different zymomonas mobilis strains were found to produce a substance which inhibited or killed various other zymomonas , escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. this antibacterial activity could  be detected in cross-streak tests and as zones of clearing in lawns of the test bacteria. when zymomonas strains are used as recipients in conjugation experiments, their antibacterial activity can be used to advantage for removal of unwanted donor cells from the mating mixtures.

TI  == r-plasmid transfer in zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == conjugal transfer of three incp1 plasmids and one incfii plasmid into strains of  the ethanol-producing bacterium zymomonas mobilis was obtained. these plasmids were transferred at high frequencies from escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa into z. mobilis and also between different z. mobilis strains, using the membrane filter mating technique. most of the plasmids were stably maintained in z. mobilis, although there was some evidence of delayed marker expression. a low level of chromosomal gene transfer, mediated by plasmid r68.45, was detected  between z. mobilis strains. genetic evidence suggesting that z. mobilis may be more closely related to e. coli than to pseudomonas or rhizobium is discussed.
