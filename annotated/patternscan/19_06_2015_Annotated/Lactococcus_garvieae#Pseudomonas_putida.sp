TI  == multiplex pcr assay for detection of four major bacterial pathogens causing rainbow trout disease.
AB  == a multiplex pcr (mpcr) method was designed for the simultaneous detection of 4 major fish pathogens, flavobacterium psychrophilum, lactococcus garvieae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and p. putida. each of the 4 pairs of oligonucleotide primers exclusively amplified the 16s rdna gene of their targeted microorganism.  the average detection limits for each organism amplified by mpcr were 2 colony-forming units (cfu) of f. psychrophilum, 3 cfu of l. garvieae, 3 cfu of p. aeruginosa, and 5 cfu of p. putida in mixed cultures. multiplex pcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against 28 related species of bacteria. high amounts of dna from 1 bacterial species had a significant effect on the amplification sensitivity of the other bacterial species when these were present in lower concentrations in the multiplex reaction. the mpcr assay proved useful for the detection of the bacteria in naturally infected fish. the assay is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible diagnostic tool for the simultaneous detection of 4 pathogenic bacteria that cause disease in fish and offers a potentially useful alternative to the conventional culture-based method.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
