TI  == construction and characterization of an effector strain of streptococcus mutans for replacement therapy of dental caries.
AB  == an effector strain has been constructed for use in the replacement therapy of dental caries. recombinant dna methods were used to make the streptococcus mutans supercolonizing strain, jh1140, lactate dehydrogenase deficient by deleting virtually all of the ldh open reading frame (orf). to compensate for the resulting metabolic imbalance, a supplemental alcohol dehydrogenase activity was  introduced by substituting the adhb orf from zymomonas mobilis in place of the deleted ldh orf. the resulting clone, bcs3-l1, was found to produce no detectable lactic acid during growth on a variety of carbon sources, and it produced significantly less total acid due to its increased production of ethanol and acetoin. bcs3-l1 was significantly less cariogenic than jh1140 in both gnotobiotic- and conventional-rodent models. it colonized the teeth of conventional rats as well as jh1140 in both aggressive-displacement and preemptive-colonization models. no gross or microscopic abnormalities of major organs were associated with oral colonization of rats with bcs3-l1 for 6 months.  acid-producing revertants of bcs3-l1 were not observed in samples taken from infected animals (reversion frequency, <10(-3)) or by screening cultures grown in vitro, where no revertants were observed among 10(5) colonies examined on ph indicator medium. the reduced pathogenic potential of bcs3-l1, its strong colonization potential, and its genetic stability suggest that this strain is well suited to serve as an effector strain in the replacement therapy of dental caries in humans.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from bacillus sp. v230.
AB  == the beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from bacillus sp. v230 has been cloned in  escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. the product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion  and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. the a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the bacillus subtilis  levanscrase (63.7% identity), the streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).

TI  == genetic and physiological analysis of the lethal effect of l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase deficiency in streptococcus mutans: complementation by alcohol dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == ch4ts is a previously isolated recombinant mutant of streptococcus mutans ng8 which produces a thermolabile l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity. it does not grow at 42 degrees c under a variety of cultivation conditions. in this study, we show that a batch culture of ch4ts shifted from 30 to 42 degrees c underwent rapid cessation of growth and accelerated cell death. the mutant grew at 42 degrees c in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions. under these conditions, lactate production was replaced by production of ethanol and, to a smaller extent, acetoin. the cloned zymomonas mobilis gene for alcohol dehydrogenase ii, placed under the control of the s. mutans spap regulatory signals, complemented ldh deficiency. the alcohol dehydrogenase-complemented mutant grew as well or better than ng8 on a variety of carbon sources at 42 degrees c and produced significant amounts of ethanol in place of lactic acid. these results are in accord with other approaches indicating that s. mutans has other enzymatic activities, including pyruvate formate-lyase and pyruvate dehydrogenase, for pyruvate metabolism. however, at high glucose concentrations,  the levels of activity of these enzymes are apparently insufficient to compensate for the absence of ldh.

TI  == isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrk gene encoding fructokinase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a gene encoding an atp-dependent fructokinase from streptococcus mutans gs-5 was  identified within a 2 kb dna fragment immediately downstream from the scra gene.  the gene cloned in escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. insertional inactivation of this gene in s. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an orf starting 199 bp downstream from the scra gene, preceded  by potential ribosome-binding (shine-dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. this  orf specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated m(r) of 31,681. the deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrk, from s. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from klebsiella  pneumoniae, e. coli plasmid pur400 or vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a  comparable gene from zymomonas mobilis.
