TI  == clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcome of gram-negative bacterial spinal epidural abscess in adults.
AB  == gram-negative (g(-)) bacterial spinal epidural abscess (sea) in adults is uncommon. of the 42 adult patients with bacterial sea admitted to the chang gung  memorial hospital - kaohsiung, between 2003 and 2007, 12 with g(-) sea were included in this study. of these 12 patients, seven were men and five were women; their ages ranged between 17 years and 81 years (median=72.5 years, mean=62.5 years). the patients were admitted at different stages of symptom onset (four were in the acute stage and four each in the subacute and chronic stages) and at  different levels of neurologic deficit severity, ranging from back pain to paraplegia. of these 12 patients, 11 had a medical and/or neurosurgical condition as the preceding event and four had a concomitant infection at other sites. back  pain (83%, 10/12) was the most common clinical presentation, followed by paraparesis (50%, 6/12), radiating pain (33%, 4/12), and urinary retention (25%,  3/12). the following causative g(-) pathogens were detected: klebsiella pneumoniae (three patients), salmonella spp. (three), escherichia coli (two), enterobacter spp. (two), aeromonas hydrophila (one), and prevotella melaninogenica (one). both enterobacter strains were resistant to multiple antibiotics. of the 12 patients, eight (66.7%) had spontaneous sea, whereas the remaining four had postneurosurgical sea. thoracic, lumbar, and thoracolumbar spine segments were the most commonly affected. after receiving medical and/or surgical treatment, 10 of the 12 patients (83%) survived, and all 10 recovered well. in conclusion, g(-) bacterial sea accounted for 28.5% (12/42) of adult sea. the causative g(-) pathogens found in this study were different from those reported in western countries, and the strains noted in our study had multiple antibiotic resistance. our findings suggest that the choice of initial empirical  antibiotics for sea should be carefully considered.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == pouch of douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and 20 healthy  women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. a total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. of 37 positive cultures  21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (iucd) implantation. the predominant aerobic isolates were escherichia coli, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus spp. our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus for optimum therapy of acute pid it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute pid and have affected the choice of therapy.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == [microbiology of acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis and treatment with taileqi troches].
AB  == a qualitative analysis of microflora from pharynx of 100 cases of acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis was performed. these patients were randomly divided into two groups so as to assess treatment effect of taileqi troches vs amoxycillin. results showed that beta-hemolytic streptococcus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms causing diseases. the predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides melaninogenicus, eptostrep. these findings suggest that anaerobic bacteria may play a pathogenic role in infection of the pharynx. the effective rate of treatment with troche alone were 86 percent, roughly consistent with amoxycillin group. no adverse effect was observed.

TI  == quantitative bacterial cultures and beta-lactamase activity in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 54 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. eighty aerobic and 81 anaerobic isolates were recovered. aerobic bacteria only were involved in 20 patients (37%), and anaerobic organisms only in seven (13%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 27 patients (50%). the most common bacteria isolated were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, bacteroides melaninogenicus group, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. there were 45 beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb), 30 aerobes, and 15 anaerobes recovered  from 38 patients (70%). beta-lactamase activity was detected in 30 of the 38 ear  aspirates (79%) that contained blpb. all but one of these organisms were in excess of 10(4) colony-forming units/ml. the detection of beta-lactamase activity in the ear aspirates provides evidence of the role of blpb in the failure of penicillin therapy to eradicate chronic ear infection.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

TI  == in vivo protection of penicillin-susceptible bacteroides melaninogenicus from penicillin by facultative bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.
AB  == we investigated the possibility that beta-lactamase producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus can protect organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus group from penicillin. a mixed infection was induced  in mice in the form of a subcutaneous abscess involving a penicillin-susceptible  encapsulated b. melaninogenicus, and a beta-lactamase producing strain of either  k. pneumoniae or s. aureus. the infected animals were treated for 7 days with single or combined antimicrobial therapy. the single agents used were penicillin, clavulanic acid, metronidazole, and gentamicin. the antimicrobial combinations were penicillin and clavulanic acid, penicillin and gentamicin, and metronidazole and gentamicin. administration of a single agent was effective in treating abscesses caused by susceptible organisms. the only effective therapy for mixed infections was by combination therapy of penicillin and clavulanic acid or metronidazole and gentamicin. this study supports the hypothesis that beta-lactamase producing facultative bacteria may shield their anaerobic counterparts from penicillin therapy, thereby contributing to the persistence of  the infection.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == an electron microscopic study of surface polysaccharides in bacteroides.
AB  == the electron microscopic appearance of the cell surface of bacteroides strains and klebsiella pneumoniae stained with ruthenium red or colloidal iron is described. the effect of polymyxin b (pmb) was also registered. it was found that all bacteroides strains have a polysaccharide lined 'micro-capsule' external to the outer membrane which could aggregate and form blebs. the blebs so formed were distinct from other types of bleb formed in klebsiella involving the outer membrane and induced by pmb. such types of pmb alterations were not induced in bacteroides.
