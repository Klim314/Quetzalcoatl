TI  - Identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in Lebanese patients.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We conducted a study of 32 Lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. Polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. The presence or absence of S aureus enterotoxin A, B, C, and D (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. Biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. A total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. Of these, only 3 (8.8%) were S aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin B). Moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. Our results could not confirm that S aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the Lebanese group studied.
TI  - Prognostic serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha in paediatric patients with sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in paediatric patients with different etiological agents and levels of sepsis. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-nine patients with sepsis were studied. Blood cultures, along with other relevant specimens, were processed for bacterial and fungal etiology. TNF-alpha was detected by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In total, 42 (53.2%) of the patients had a microbiologically documented cause for sepsis. Of the gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter spp. Serratia marscecens as well as Citrobacter koseri. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus predominated among the gram-positive cocci. Patients with a positive culture had significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than patients with a negative culture (70 pg/ml vs. 33 pg/ml p = 0.01). Patients with a pure gram-negative infection had significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than those with pure gram-positive infection (83 pg/ml vs.52 pg/ml). The geometric mean TNF-alpha concentrations in patients with severe sepsis and those with late septic shock were 47 pg/ml (range 5-2720) and 59 pg/ml (range 5-3310) respectively. CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha was significantly raised in culture-positive cases in general and in gram-negative infections in particular. It can be used as a surrogate marker of sepsis and aggressive treatment initiated in patients with elevated levels of TNF alpha.
TI  - [Clinical results of resection arthroplasty for infected shoulder arthroplasty].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  Various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. We evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. Mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). Bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-S Staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=5 including three S. epidermidis) Streptococcus mitis (n=1) and Citrobacter koseri (n=1). The mean Constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). Subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. Surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. RESULTS: Patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. The objective functional outcome measured with the Constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. This was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. All patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). Patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. Clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. DISCUSSION: Infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. Resection only has a modest clinical effect. Precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. Early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. Functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. This procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. Improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.
TI  - Dizygotic twins discordant for early-onset Citrobacter koseri and group B streptococcal sepsis.
AB  - Early-onset neonatal sepsis is usually a multisystem fulminant illness with prominent respiratory symptoms, and typically the infant has acquired the organism from the maternal genital tract during the intrapartum period. In this article, we report a rare case of dizygotic twins where each individual suffered early-onset sepsis caused by a different pathogen. Group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis was diagnosed in twin A 1 day after birth; sepsis and meningitis caused by Citrobacter koseri was diagnosed in twin B at the age of the 4 days. The mother developed pre-eclampsia and fever and the twins were delivered via cesarean section at 35 week's gestation. Twin A received ampicillin treatment for 14 days and recovered fully. Twin B was treated with ceftriaxone for 4 weeks and follow-up brain ultrasound revealed persistent enlargement of the bilateral-lateral ventricles. When empiric antibiotic is considered for the symptomatic twin of a sibling with early-onset GBS infection, samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be obtained for culture study before treatment. Adjustment of antibiotic treatment based on the results of cultures and CSF Gram stain and antibiotic susceptibility test is essential.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
