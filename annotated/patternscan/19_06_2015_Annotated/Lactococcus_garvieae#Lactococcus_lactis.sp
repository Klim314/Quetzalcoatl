TI  == the plasmid complement of the cheese isolate lactococcus garvieae ipla 31405 revealed adaptation to the dairy environment.
AB  == lactococcus garvieae is a lactic acid bacterium found in raw-milk dairy products  as well as a range of aquatic and terrestrial environments. the plasmids in l. garvieae have received little attention compared to those of dairy lactococcus lactis, in which the genes carried by these extrachromosomal elements are considered of adaptive value. the present work reports the sequencing and analysis of the plasmid complement of l. garvieae ipla 31405, a strain isolated from a traditional, spanish, starter-free cheese made from raw-milk. it consists  of plg9 and plg42, of 9,124 and 42,240 nucleotides, respectively. based on sequence and structural homology in the putative origin of replication (ori) region, plg9 and plg42 are predicted to replicate via a theta mechanism. real-time, quantitative pcr showed the number of copies per chromosome equivalent of plg9 and plg42 to be around two and five, respectively. sequence analysis identified eight complete open reading frames (orfs) in plg9 and 36 in plg42; these were organized into functional modules or cassettes containing different numbers of genes. these modules were flanked by complete or interrupted insertion sequence (is)-like elements. among the modules of plg42 was a gene cluster encoding specific components of a phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system, including a phospho-beta-galacosidase. the cluster showed a complete nucleotide identity respect to that in plasmids of l. lactis. loss of plg42 showed this to be involved in lactose assimilation. in the same plasmid, an operon encoding a type i restriction/modification (r/m) system was also identified. the specificity of this r/m system might be broadened by different r/m specificity subunits detected in plg9 and in the bacterial chromosome. however, challenges of l. garvieae ipla 31405 against l. lactis phages proved that the r/m system was not involved in phage resistance. together, these results support the hypothesis that, as in l. lactis, plg42 contribute towards the adaptation of l. garvieae to the dairy environment.

TI  == characterization, identification and application of lactic acid bacteria isolated from forage paddy rice silage.
AB  == there has been growing interest to develop forage rice as a new feed resource for livestock. this study was to characterize the natural population of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and select potentially excellent strains for paddy rice silage preparation in china. one hundred and twenty-six strains were isolated and screened from paddy rice silage prepared using a small-scale fermentation system, and ninety-nine of these isolates were considered to be lab based on their gram-positive and catalase-negative morphology and the production of most of their metabolic products as lactic acid. these isolates were divided into eight groups (a-h) on the basis of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. the group a to h strains were identified as lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum (species ratio: 8.1%), l. casei (5.1%), leuconostoc (ln.) pseudomesenteroides (11.1%), pediococcus (p.) pentosaceus (24.2%), enterococcus (e.) mundtii (12.1%), lactococcus (lc.) garvieae (15.2%), e. faecium (9.1%) and lc. lactis subsp. lactis (15.2%) based on sequence analyses of their 16s rrna and reca genes. p. pentosaceus was the most abundant member of the lab population in  the paddy rice silage. a selected strain, namely l. casei r 465, was found to be  able to grow under low ph conditions and to improve the silage quality with low ph and a relatively high content of lactic acid. this study demonstrated that forage paddy rice silage contains abundant lab species and its silage can be well preserved by inoculation with lab, and that strain r 465 can be a potentially excellent inoculant for paddy rice silage.

TI  == potential aquaculture probiont lactococcus lactis tw34 produces nisin z and inhibits the fish pathogen lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis tw34 was isolated from marine fish. tw34 bacteriocin inhibited the growth of the fish pathogen lactococcus garvieae at 5 au/ml (minimum inhibitory concentration), whereas the minimum bactericidal concentration was 10 au/ml. addition of tw34 bacteriocin to l. garvieae cultures  resulted in a decrease of six orders of magnitude of viable cells counts demonstrating a bactericidal mode of action. the direct detection of the bacteriocin activity by tricine-sds-page showed an active peptide with a molecular mass ca. 4.5 kda. the analysis by maldi-tof-ms detected a strong signal at m/z 2,351.2 that corresponded to the nisin leader peptide mass without the initiating methionine, whose sequence stkdfnldlvsvskkdsgaspr was confirmed by ms/ms. sequence analysis of nisin structural gene confirmed that l. lactis tw34 was a nisin z producer. this nisin z-producing strain with probiotic properties might be considered as an alternative in the prevention of lactococcosis, a global disease in aquaculture systems.

TI  == inhibition of fish pathogens by the microbiota from rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss, walbaum) and rearing environment.
AB  == this work reports the isolation and taxonomic identification of the cultivable total microbiota (tm) and lactic acid bacteria (lab) from rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss, walbaum) and rearing environment from selected stages of the life-cycle, and the evaluation of the lab antimicrobial activity against the  main fish pathogens. tm and lab isolates were randomly selected and identified by 16s rrna and/or superoxide dismutase gene sequencing. although a great diversity  in the tm was observed, enterobacteriaceae and aeromonadaceae were clearly prevalent, while the genus lactococcus was the predominant lab. from a total of 1620 randomly selected lab, 1159 isolates (71.5%) showed antimicrobial activity.  from these, 248 isolates (21.4%) selected for their activity against, at least, four fish pathogens, were taxonomically identified, being lactococcus lactis the  most common species (164 isolates, 66.1%). interestingly, 88 isolates (35.5%), including 55 l. lactis isolates, exerted activity against four strains of the rainbow trout pathogen lactococcus garvieae. our results demonstrate that rainbow trout and rearing environment are potential sources for the isolation of lab, mainly lactococci, active against l. garvieae and other fish pathogens. moreover, this is the first study describing the cultivable tm and lab from rainbow trout intestine and rearing environment along the fish life-cycle. the host-derived lab active against fish pathogens comprise potential candidates as probiotics in rainbow trout farming as an alternative or complementary strategy to antibiotics  and vaccines for disease prevention.

TI  == insertion sequence elements in lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == insertion sequences are the simplest intracellular mobile genetic elements which  can occur in very high numbers in prokaryotic genomes, where they play an important evolutionary role by promoting genome plasticity. as such, the studies  on the diversity and distribution of insertion sequences in genomes not yet investigated can contribute to improve the knowledge on a bacterial species and to identify new transposable elements. the present work describes the occurrence  of insertion sequences in lactococcus garvieae, an opportunistic emerging zoonotic and human pathogen, also associated with different food matrices. to date, no insertion elements have been described for l. garvieae in the is element database. the analysis of the twelve published l. garvieae genomes identified 15  distinct insertion sequences that are members of the is3, is982, is6, is21 and is256 families, including five new elements. most of the insertion sequences in l. garvieae show substantial homology to the lactococcus lactis elements, suggesting the movement of is between these two species phylogenetically closely  related. isll6 elements belonging to is3 family were most abundant, with several  copies distributed in 9 of the 12 genomes analyzed. an alignment analysis of two  complete genomes carrying multi-copies of this insertion sequence indicates a possible involvement of isll6 in chromosomal rearrangement.

TI  == lactococcosis in silver carp.
AB  == an adult silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix with a focally extensive skin lesion near the caudal peduncle and mild iridial hemorrhage was submitted to the  aquatic research and diagnostic laboratory (ardl) in stoneville, mississippi, as  part of a fish kill investigation. touch impressions of this musculoskeletal lesion revealed small cocci ( approximately 1 mum) in pairs or chains within an inflammatory milieu. a pure gram-positive cocci isolate was obtained from the brain, while cultures of the kidney and muscle yielded multiple bacterial colony  types, including the gram-positive cocci seen in the brain. this brain isolate was characterized biochemically and identified as lactococcus spp. analysis of the near complete 16s small subunit ribosomal dna (ssu rdna) and dna gyrase subunit b (gyrb) gene sequences revealed the bacterium to be l. lactis subsp. lactis (ssu rdna: 100% identity, 1,372/1,372 bp; gyrb: 99.7% identity, 1,779/1,785 bp). comparatively, at the gyrb locus the case isolate shared less than 90% similarity to l. lactis subsp. cremoris (1,599/1,781 bp) and less than 80% homology to l. garvieae (1409/1775 bp). histopathological examination confirmed a severe meningoencephalitis, a moderate mononuclear myositis, and a mild interstitial nephritis. we believe this represents the first report of a natural infection by l. lactis subsp. lactis in silver carp.

TI  == lactococcus garvieae: where is it from? a first approach to explore the evolutionary history of this emerging pathogen.
AB  == the population structure and diversity of lactococcus garvieae, an emerging pathogen of increasing clinical significance, was determined at both gene and genome level. selected lactococcal isolates of various origins were analyzed by a multi locus sequence typing (mlst). this gene-based analysis was compared to genomic characteristics, estimated through the complete genome sequences available in database. the mlst identified two branches containing the majority of the strains and two branches bearing one strain each. one strain was particularly differentiated from the other l. garvieae strains, showing a significant genetic distance. the genomic characteristics, correlated to the mlst-based phylogeny, indicated that this "separated strain" appeared first and could be considered the evolutionary intermediate between lactococcus lactis and  l. garvieae main clusters. a preliminary genome analysis of l. garvieae indicated a pan-genome constituted of about 4100 genes, which included 1341 core genes and  2760 genes belonging to the dispensable genome. a total of 1491 clusters of orthologous genes (cogs) were found to be specific to the 11 l. garvieae genomes, with the genome of the "separated strain" showing the highest presence of unique  genes.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of a traditional chinese fish product, chouguiyu (stinky mandarinfish).
AB  == chouguiyu, or stinky mandarinfish, is a traditional chinese fermented fish product made of mandarinfish by spontaneous fermentation at the anaerobic condition with low-salt concentration. in order to get a primary understanding of the microbial community presenting in the chouguiyu fermentation, 61 cultures of  lactic acid bacteria (lab) from various fermentation period were isolated using mrs agar plates and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) and 16s rrna partial gene sequencing analysis. eight distinct bacterial species belonging to 6 genera were identified in total. among them, lactobacillus sakei was the dominant species (63%) during the fermentation, which exhibited great variety in phenotypic tests but unique genotypic characters. meanwhile, the other lab species including lactococcus (lc.) garvieae, lc. lactis, lc. raffinolactis, vagococcus sp., enterococcus hermanniensis, macrococcus caseolyticus as well as streptococcus parauberis were also recovered from the different fermentation periods, especially at the initial point of the fermentation. this seems to be the 1st report investigating the lab composition involved in chouguiyu fermentation and the data obtained in this study may be valuable for selecting starter culture for chouguiyu industrial-scale production.

TI  == survival and beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria from raniculture subjected to freeze-drying and storage.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effect of freeze-drying and storage conditions on the viability and beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) for raniculture. methods and results: lactococcus lactis crl 1584, l. lactis crl 1827, lactococcus garvieae crl 1828 and lactobacillus plantarum crl 1606 viability under different conditions was studied. 10% lactose and 5% skim milk +  5% lactose were excellent lyoprotectants, but 5% skim milk + 5% lactose and whey  protein concentrated (wpc) or wpc + sugars were the lower cost lyoprotective options. the effect of temperature depended on both lyoprotectants and storage time. thus, for lactococcus, skim milk, skim milk + sucrose and wpc + sucrose were selected for lyophilization and storage at 4 degrees c and skim milk + lactose for 25 degrees c. for lact. plantarum crl 1606, the best lyoprotectants for lyophilization and storage at 4 degrees c were milk + sugars and wps + sucrose and, at 25 degrees c, skim milk + sucrose. conclusions: lactic acid bacteria viability after freeze-drying was strain-specific and depended on the lyoprotectant used. highest viability was obtained when stored at 4 degrees c, and the beneficial properties remained stable for 18 months independently of storage temperature. significance and impact of the study: the studies reported for the first time in this work are of primary interest to obtain dried bacteria  to be included in beneficial products for raniculture.

TI  == development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == a selective and differential medium termed 'lg agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of lactococcus garvieae that results in  black colonies with red halos. in this study, all 14 strains of l. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the  lg agar. the nine viable strains on lg agar plates (including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio furnissii, vibrio mimicus and vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from l. garvieae by various colours or colony features. colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using lg agar plates were all positively identified as l. garvieae by conventional tests and 16s rdna sequencing. furthermore, lg agar discriminated capsulated strains of l. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. the specificity and differentiating ability of lg agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of l. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

TI  == development of a 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer-based quantitative pcr assay for  improved detection and enumeration of lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == lactococcus garvieae is an important foodborne pathogen causing lactococcosis associated with hemorrhagic septicemia in fish worldwide. a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) protocol targeting the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer (its) region was developed for the detection and enum-eration of l. garvieae. the specificity was evaluated using genomic dnas extracted from 66 cocci strains. fourteen l. garvieae strains tested were positive, whereas 52 other strains including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactococcus lactis ssp. hordniae and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris did not show a specific signal. the minimal limit of detection was 2.63 fg of purified genomic dna, equivalent to 1 genome of l. garvieae. the optimized protocol was applied for the survey of l. garvieae in naturally contaminated fish samples. our results suggest that the qpcr protocol using its is a sensitive and efficient tool for the rapid detection and enumeration of l. garvieae in fish and fish-containing foods.

TI  == development of a reverse line blot hybridization method for detection of some streptococcal/lactococcal species, the causative agents of zoonotic streptococosis/lactococosis in farmed fish.
AB  == background and objective: streptococcosis/lactococcosis is the cause of high morbidity and mortality in aquaculture sector and to date a number of species of  streptococcus and lactococcus genera including s. iniae, s. agalactiae, s. dysagalactiae, s. parauberis, s. feacalis, l. garvieae and l. lactis have been discriminated as the cause of disease in aquatic animals. despite the use of diagnostic molecular methods for each of these bacterial species, no data is available on a suitable, rapid and simple simultaneous detection tool for these pathogens. this paper describes a simultaneous detection method which is pcr based on a reverse line blot (rlb) for rapid detection and differentiation of four species of genera of streptococcus and lactococcus genera consisting of s. iniae, s. agalactiae, s. parauberis and l. garvieae the most important agents of  the disease in fish. materials and methods: a reverse line blot (rlb) assay was developed for the simultaneously identification of four species of streptococcus/lactococcusconsisting of s. iniae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiaeand  lactococcusgarvieae. the assay employs one set of primer pair for specific amplification of the 16s rrna gene. these were designed based on the nucleotide sequences of 16s rrna gene sharing a homology region with streptococcus spp. and  lactococcus spp. dna was extracted from the pure bacterial colonies and amplified. a membrane was prepared with specific oligonucleotide for each bacterial species. pcr products were then hybridized to a membrane. results and conclusion: the amplification resulted in pcr product of 241 bp in length. no cross-reactions were observed between any of the tested bacterial species, and mixed dnas from these four bacterial species were correctly identified. this rlb  method is a suitable technique for a simultaneous detection of these species of bacterial fish pathogens that are some of the main causes of streptococcal/lactococcal infections in both freshwater and marine aquatic animals, and so we recommend its use for integrated epidemiological monitoring of streptococcosis/lactococcis in aquaculture industry.

TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  == in order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (lab) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 lab strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (phleum pratense l.) and orchardgrass (dactylis glomerata l.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. according to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups,  including enterococcus gallinarum, lactobacillus acidipiscis, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, l. coryniformis subsp. torquens, l. curvatus, l. paraplantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. plantarum subsp. plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella hellenica, weissella paramesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens. this is the first report to document that c. divergens, l. acidipiscis, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. garvieae, phenotypically novel l. lactis subsp. cremoris, e. gallinarum and w. hellenica are present in vegetative  forage crops. l. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences  for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth ph and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. these results are useful in understanding the diversity of lab associated with decayed silage of timothy and  orchardgrass.

TI  == effects of wilting and molasses addition on fermentation and bacterial community  in guinea grass silage.
AB  == aims: acetic acid is considered an important preservative in tropical grass ensiling. the objective of the current experiments was to follow the ensiling fermentation of low dry matter (dm) tropical grass as a model to study changes in bacterial communities during acetic acid fermentation. methods and results: direct-cut and wilted guinea grass silage was prepared with and without molasses. a high acetic acid level was observed during the fermentation of direct-cut silage, and long storage increased the butyric acid and ethanol content if molasses was not added. the lactic acid production in wilted silage was greater than the acetic acid production, but prolonged ensiling decreased the lactic to acetic acid ratio regardless of molasses addition. adding molasses enhanced the lactic acid content in both direct-cut and wilted silage. the bacterial community, identified by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, was affected by wilting and molasses addition. bands for pantoea sp. and morganella sp. became faint when acetic acid fermentation was suppressed, and those for pediococcus pentosaceus and lactococcus garvieae were detected when lactic acid fermentation  was enhanced by wilting and molasses addition. lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were found throughout the ensiling process in all silage types. conclusion: distinct changes occurred in the bacterial community in guinea grass silage because of wilting and molasses addition. these changes could explain how lactic acid fermentation was enhanced but could not help determine which bacteria were associated with enhanced acetic acid fermentation. significance and impact of the study: the study reveals the effects of wilting and molasses during ensiling of low dm tropical grasses and the associated bacteria.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of lactococcus garvieae using a suppression subtractive hybridization library: discovery of novel dna signatures.
AB  == lactococcus garvieae, the pathogenic species in the genus lactococcus, is recognized as an emerging pathogen in fish, animals, and humans. despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of l. garvieae, little is known about the genomic content of this microorganism. suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify the genomic differences between l. garvieae and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, its closest phylogenetic neighbor, and the type species of the genus lactococcus. twenty-seven clones were specific  to l. garvieae and were highly different from lactococcus lactis in their nucleotide and protein sequences. lactococcus garvieae primer sets were subsequently designed for two of these clones corresponding to a pyrh gene and a  novel dna signature for application in the specific detection of l. garvieae. the primer specificities were evaluated relative to three previously described 16s rrna gene-targeted methods using 32 lactococcus and closely related strains. both newly designed primer sets were highly specific to l. garvieae and performed better than did the existing primers. our findings may be useful for developing more stable and accurate tools for the discrimination of l. garvieae from other closely related species.

TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

TI  == complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of the fish pathogen lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == lactococcus garvieae causes fatal haemorrhagic septicaemia in fish such as yellowtail. the comparative analysis of genomes of a virulent strain lg2 and a non-virulent strain atcc 49156 of l. garvieae revealed that the two strains shared a high degree of sequence identity, but lg2 had a 16.5-kb capsule gene cluster that is absent in atcc 49156. the capsule gene cluster was composed of 15 genes, of which eight genes are highly conserved with those in exopolysaccharide  biosynthesis gene cluster often found in lactococcus lactis strains. sequence analysis of the capsule gene cluster in the less virulent strain l. garvieae lg2-s, lg2-derived strain, showed that two conserved genes were disrupted by a single base pair deletion, respectively. these results strongly suggest that the  capsule is crucial for virulence of lg2. the capsule gene cluster of lg2 may be a genomic island from several features such as the presence of insertion sequences  flanked on both ends, different gc content from the chromosomal average, integration into the locus syntenic to other lactococcal genome sequences, and distribution in human gut microbiomes. the analysis also predicted other potential virulence factors such as haemolysin. the present study provides new insights into understanding of the virulence mechanisms of l. garvieae in fish.

AB  == in this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. the oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. of these, 8 isolates [leuconostoc mesenteroides (rl75), lactococcus garvieae (cd2), lactococcus subsp. lactis (cs21), enterococcus faecium (cl71 and cl72), and enterococcus faecalis (cd14, cs62, and cd12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro.  isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. the oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of enterococcus, a mixture of lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). in comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in  all three groups (p<0.05). in most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20  g/l of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/l of glucose or no glucose. the mixture of all isolates showed  higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. the oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.

TI  == expression of immune-related genes in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) induced by probiotic bacteria during lactococcus garvieae infection.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the control of lactococcosis as well as to assess the impact of probiotics on the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney and intestine of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides, were administered orally at 10(6) cfu g(-)(1) feed to fish for 36 days. twenty-one days after the start of the feeding period, fish were challenged with lactococcus garvieae. only the fish fed the diet containing lb. plantarum showed significantly (p < 0.05) improved protection against l. garvieae compared to the control. subsequently, real-time pcr was employed to determine the mrna levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and tnf-alpha in the head kidney, and il-8, tlr5 and igt in the intestine of the control and lb. plantarum groups. il-1beta, il-10 and tnf-alpha gene expression were significantly up-regulated by lb. plantarum. moreover, the mrna levels of il-10, il-8 and igt were significantly higher in the lb. plantarum group after l. garvieae infection, suggesting that lb. plantarum can stimulate the immune response of rainbow trout. pcr-dgge revealed no detectable levels of the probiotics or the pathogen present on the distal intestinal mucosa. these findings demonstrate that direct probiotic-host interactions with the intestine are not always necessary to induce host stimulatory responses which ultimately enhance disease resistance. furthermore, as l. garvieae did not colonise the intestinal tract, and therefore likely did not infect via this route, the antagonistic properties of the probiotic candidate towards l. garvieae were likely of little influence in mediating the improved disease resistance which could be attributed to the elevated immunological response.

TI  == novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction primer set for identification of lactococcus species.
AB  == aims: the gram-positive bacterial genus lactococcus has been taxonomically classified into seven species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus piscium, lactococcus plantarum, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus chungangensis and lactococcus fujiensis). this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of the seven lactococcal species, as well as to differentiate the  two industrially important dairy subspecies, l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris. methods and results: a multiplex pcr primer set was designed based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna gene of the seven lactococcal species. the specificity of the established one-step multiplex pcr scheme was verified using more than 200 bacterial strains, in which a complete sequence match was confirmed by partial sequencing of their 16s rrna gene. conclusions: the one-step multiplex pcr enables the identification and speciation of bacterial strains belonging to the genus lactococcus and the differentiation of strains of l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris. significance and impact of the study: this work provides an efficient method for identification of lactococcal strains of industrial importance.

TI  == lactococcus fujiensis sp. nov., a lactic acid bacterium isolated from vegetable matter.
AB  == three strains of lactic acid bacteria, designated nj 317(t), nj 414 and nj 415, were isolated from the outer leaves of chinese cabbages (brassica rapa l. var. glabra regel) and characterized taxonomically. the strains were gram-reaction-positive, catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic cocci that did not produce gas from glucose and formed l-lactic acid. the major fatty acids were c(18 : 1)omega9c, c(16 : 0), c(14 : 0) and summed feature 10. morphological, physiological and phylogenetic data indicated that the strains belonged to the genus lactococcus. these strains shared similar phenotypic characteristics and exhibited dna relatedness values >96.6 % to each other, indicating that they represent a single species. the dna g+c contents of the three strains were 42.1-42.5 mol%. 16s rrna gene sequences of the novel strains were determined and  aligned with those of other species of the genus lactococcus. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis the three strains grouped with other members of the genus lactococcus. lactococcus lactis and lactococcus garvieae were the most closely related species, sharing a sequence similarity value of 94.4 % with the three strains. ribotyping patterns, however, revealed that these strains were well-separated from reference strains of species of the genus lactococcus and dna-dna hybridization studies indicated that the novel strains had low levels (<20.2 %) of dna relatedness with reference strains of l. lactis, l. garvieae and other type strains of previously described species, showing that they represent a different species. based on this evidence, strains nj 317(t), nj 414 and nj 415 represent a novel species of the genus lactococcus, for which the name lactococcus fujiensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is nj 317(t) ( = jcm16395(t) = cgmcc 1.10453(t)).

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == identification and typing of lactococcus lactis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == currently, the genus lactococcus is classified into six species: lactococcus chungangensis, l. garvieae, l. lactis, l. piscium, l. plantarum, and l. raffinolactis. among these six species, l. lactis is especially important because of its use in the manufacture of probiotic dairy products. l. lactis consists of  three subspecies: l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. lactis subsp. hordniae, and l. lactis subsp. lactis. however, these subspecies have not yet been reliably discriminated. to date, mainly phenotypic identification has been used, with a few genotypic identifications. we discriminated species or subspecies in the genus lactococcus not only by proteomics identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) but also by phenotypic and genotypic identification. the proteomics identification using differences in the mass spectra of ribosomal proteins was nearly identical  to that by genotypic identification (i.e., by analyses of 16s rrna and reca gene  sequences and amplified fragment length polymorphism). the three ribosomal subunits 30s/l31, 50s/l31, and 50s/l35 were the best markers for discriminating l. lactis subsp. cremoris from l. lactis subsp. lactis. proteomics identification using maldi-tof ms was therefore a powerful method for discriminating and identifying these bacteria. in addition, this method was faster and more reliable than others that we examined.

TI  == analysis of the genome content of lactococcus garvieae by genomic interspecies microarray hybridization.
AB  == background: lactococcus garvieae is a bacterial pathogen that affects different animal species in addition to humans. despite the widespread distribution and emerging clinical significance of l. garvieae in both veterinary and human medicine, there is almost a complete lack of knowledge about the genetic content  of this microorganism. in the present study, the genomic content of l. garvieae cect 4531 was analysed using bioinformatics tools and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) experiments. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and streptococcus pneumoniae tigr4 were used as reference microorganisms. results: the combination and integration of in silico analyses and in vitro cgh experiments, performed in comparison with the reference microorganisms, allowed establishment of an inter-species hybridization framework with a detection threshold based on a sequence similarity of >or= 70%. with this  threshold value, 267 genes were identified as having an analogue in l. garvieae,  most of which (n = 258) have been documented for the first time in this pathogen. most of the genes are related to ribosomal, sugar metabolism or energy conversion systems. some of the identified genes, such as als and myca, could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. conclusions: in this study, we identified 267 genes that were potentially present in l. garvieae cect 4531. some of the identified genes could be involved in the pathogenesis of l. garvieae infections. these results provide the first insight into the genome content of l. garvieae.

TI  == inhibitory activity against the fish pathogen lactococcus garvieae produced by lactococcus lactis tw34, a lactic acid bacterium isolated from the intestinal tract of a patagonian fish.
AB  == after enrichment of odontesthes platensis intestinal contents, 53 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated. from the four isolates that showed inhibitory activity against lactococcus garvieae 03/8460, strain tw34 was selected because it exerted the strongest inhibition. it also inhibited other gram-positive bacteria, but not gram-negative fish pathogens. phenotypic and 16s rdna phylogenetic analyses showed that tw34 belongs to lactococcus lactis. in addition, tw34 showed to be sensitive to different antibiotics. the production of the inhibitory agent against l. garvieae was growth associated, and it was significantly influenced by the incubation temperature. the optimal temperature for the antimicrobial production was as low as 15 degrees c. both acidification and hydrogen peroxide production were ruled out as the source of inhibition. in contrast, the antimicrobial activity was completely lost by treatment with proteolytic enzymes, which confirmed that the inhibitory substance was a bacteriocin. the bacteriocin was highly thermostable (121 degrees c for 15 min) and active between ph 3 and 11. it remained stable for up to 2 months when stored at 4 degrees c and up to 6 months at -20 degrees c. our results suggest that the  strain l. lactis tw34 could provide an alternative for lactococcosis control and  therefore be considered for future challenge experiments with fish.

TI  == diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of casin, a traditional spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  == classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional spanish casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. as with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of casin was shown to be high by both culturing and dgge analyses. the culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (lab) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. of the 14 bacterial species identified, lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. as expected, the dgge profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. among these, a band corresponding to streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. this species had never been identified from traditional spanish cheeses  previously. culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of  casin manufacture. random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd) profiling suggested that the l. garvieae and l. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. in addition, only a single l. lactis rapd pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. after a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for casin. additional species (such as lactobacillus plantarum and corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.

TI  == a study of lactose metabolism in lactococcus garvieae reveals a genetic marker for distinguishing between dairy and fish biotypes.
AB  == dairy and fish isolates of lactococcus garvieae were tested for their ability to  utilize lactose and to grow in milk. fish isolates were unable to assimilate lactose, but unexpectedly, they possessed the ability to grow in milk. genetic studies, carried out constructing different vectorette libraries, provided evidence that in fish isolates, no genes involved in lactose utilization were present. for l. garvieae dairy isolates, a single system for the catabolism of lactose was found. it consists of a lactose transport and hydrolysis depending on a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system combined with a phospho-beta-galactosidase. the genes involved were highly similar at the nucleotide sequence level to their counterparts in lactococcus lactis; however, while in many l. lactis strains these genes are plasmid encoded, in l. garvieae they are chromosomally located. thus, in the species l. garvieae, the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene, detectable in all strains of dairy origin but lacking in fish isolates, can be considered a reliable genetic marker for distinguishing biotypes in the two diverse ecological niches. moreover, we obtained information regarding the complete nucleotide sequence of the gal operon in l. garvieae, consisting of a galactose permease and the leloir pathway enzymes. this is one of the first reports concerning the determination of the nucleotide sequences of genes (other than the 16s rdna gene) in l. garvieae and should be considered a step in a continuous effort to explore the genome of this  species, with the aim of determining the real relationship between the presence of l. garvieae in dairy products and food safety.

TI  == transfer of plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline in pathogenic bacteria from fish and aquaculture environments.
AB  == the transferability of a large plasmid that harbors a tetracycline resistance gene tet(s), to fish and human pathogens was assessed using electrotransformation and conjugation. the plasmid, originally isolated from fish intestinal lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis kya-7, has potent antagonistic activity against the selected recipients (lactococcus garvieae and listeria monocytogenes), preventing conjugation. therefore the tetracycline resistance determinant was transferred via electroporation to l. garvieae. a transformant clone was used as  the donor in conjugation experiments with three different l. monocytogenes strains. to our knowledge, this is the first study showing the transfer of an antibiotic resistance plasmid from fish-associated lactic bacteria to l. monocytogenes, even if the donor l. garvieae was not the original host of the tetracycline resistance but experimentally created by electroporation. these results demonstrate that the antibiotic resistance genes in the fish intestinal bacteria have the potential to spread both to fish and human pathogens, posing a  risk to aquaculture and consumer safety.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in lactococcus species from bovine milk: presence of a mutated multidrug transporter mdt(a) gene in susceptible lactococcus garvieae strains.
AB  == a total of 72 lactococcus strains (41 lactococcus lactis and 31 lactococcus garvieae) isolated from bovine milk were tested for susceptibility to 17 antibiotics and screened for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes using a  microarray. resistance to tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin, streptomycin,  nitrofurantoin were found. the tetracycline-resistant l. garvieae and l. lactis harbored tet(m) and tet(s). l. lactis that were resistant to clindamycin were also resistant to erythromycin and possessed the erm(b) gene. the multidrug transporter mdt(a), originally described in l. lactis, was detected for the first time in l. garvieae and does not confer decreased susceptibility to erythromycin  nor tetracycline in this species. mdt(a) of l. garvieae contains one mutation in  each antiporter motif c, which is known to play an essential role in drug efflux  antiporters. this suggests that the mutations found in the c-motifs of mdt(a) from l. garvieae may be responsible for susceptibility. the study revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in non-pathogenic and pathogenic lactococci from bovine milk, including a mutated multidrug transporter in l. garvieae.

TI  == lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis also causes white muscle disease in farmed giant freshwater prawns macrobrachium rosenbergii.
AB  == from may to august 2001 in taiwan, 27 farms for the giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii experienced white tail disease outbreaks in animals approximately 3 to 5 mo old, with total lengths from 6 to 8 cm. examination of the infected prawns revealed not only previously reported lactococcus garvieae (16 farms) but also the novel l. lactis subsp. lactis (10 farms). one farm had shrimp infected with both bacteria. in the farms with l. lactis infections, the cumulative mortality was approximately 25 to 60%. gross signs of disease were opaque and whitish muscles, while histopathology included marked edema and necrotic lesions, with inflammation in the muscles and hepatopancreas. bacteria isolated using brain/heart infusion medium or tryptic soy agar were gram-positive and ovoid. eleven isolates from different farms were identified as l. lactis subsp. lactis using api 20 strep and rapid id32 strep tests and using pcr assays  specific for the l. lactis subsp. lactis 16s rdna gene (650 bp amplicon) and for  the 16s to 23s rdna interspacer region (380 bp amplicon). in addition, sequencing of the full 16s rdna genes of 2 of the isolates (mr17 and mr26; genbank accession numbers af493058 and af493057, respectively) revealed 99.9% identity between the  isolates and 98.7% identity to several complete 16s rrna sequences of l. lactis subsp. lactis at genbank. experimental infections with our isolates gave gross signs and histopathological changes similar to those seen in naturally infected prawns. the mean lethal dose of 4 isolates and the reference strain l. lactis subsp. lactis bcrc 10791 ranged from 4.2 x 10(6) to 2.5 x 10(7) colony-forming units prawn(-1), indicating virulence similar to that previously reported for l.  garvieae. this is the first report confirming l. lactis subsp. lactis as a pathogen in juvenile and adult prawns from aquaculture.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rrna gene restriction analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. in addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as streptococcus iniae and lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and  many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. to clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated  bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra). twelve distinct  clusters were delineated on the basis of ardra profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of soda and 16s rrna genes. these clusters included the following: lactococcus raffinolactis, l. garvieae, lactococcus l., s. iniae, s. dysgalactiae, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, carnobacterium spp., the enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized  v. carniphilus, v. salmoninarum, and aerococcus spp. interestingly, the l. lactis and l. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. the significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, aerococcus and enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the microbial communities of different cheeses where listeria monocytogenes either grew or did not grow. for this purpose, (i) isolates from the most inhibitory cheese ecosystem were identified and their ability to produce anti-listeria substances was determined, (ii) bacterial communities of cheeses with and without l. monocytogenes growth were compared using the single strand conformation polymorphism method. the study showed sscp to be an effective tool for differentiating between the bacterial communities of different cheeses manufactured with the same technology. all the cheeses with the lowest l. monocytogenes counts on day 8 were distinguished by the dominance in their sscp profiles, after amplification of the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene, of 3 peaks whose nucleotide sequences comigrated with enterococcus faecium and enterococcus saccharominimus, chryseobacterium sp and corynebacterium flavescens, lactococcus garvieae and lactococcus lactis respectively. however, no anti-listeria compounds were produced under our experimental conditions. these six bacterial species were inoculated, separately or together, into pasteurised milk and their anti-listerial activity in cheese was evaluated. the area of inhibition between the control and trial curves confirmed that l. monocytogenes is inhibited by e. saccharominimus, c. flavescens, l. lactis, l. garvieae and the mixture of all six bacterial strains. further studies should be performed to determine the metabolites involved in l. monocytogenes inhibition.

AB  == bacterial biodiversity occurring in traditional egyptian soft domiati cheese was  studied by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). bands were identified using a reference species database (j.-c. ogier et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70:5628-5643, 2004); de novo bands having nonidentified migration patterns were identified by dna sequencing. results reveal a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial  biodiversity in domiati cheeses, as reflected by the numerous bands present in ttge and dgge patterns. the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were as follows: leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus garvieae, aerococcus viridans, lactobacillus versmoldensis, pediococcus inopinatus, and lactococcus lactis. frequent non-lab species included numerous coagulase-negative staphylococci, vibrio spp., kocuria rhizophila, kocuria kristinae, kocuria halotolerans, arthrobacter spp./brachybacterium tyrofermentans. this is the first time that the majority of these species has been identified in domiati cheese. nearly all the dominant and frequent bacterial species are salt tolerant, and several correspond to known marine bacteria. as domiati cheese contains 5.4 to 9.5% nacl, we suggest that these bacteria are likely to have an important role in the ripening process. this first systematic study of the microbial composition of domiati cheeses reveals great biodiversity and evokes a role for marine bacteria in determining cheese type.

TI  == microbial diversity and succession during the manufacture and ripening of traditional, spanish, blue-veined cabrales cheese, as determined by pcr-dgge.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant microbial communities arising during the manufacture and ripening of four batches of naturally fermented cabrales cheese were investigated by the pcr-dgge culture-independent technique. total microbial dna was extracted from cheese milk, curd and cheese samples and used as template material in pcr experiments to amplify the v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene, plus the d1 region of the eukaryotic 26s rrna gene. these regions  were then analysed using dgge. eukaryotic and bacterial bands were identified by  isolation, reamplification and sequencing. the results were compared to those obtained in a previous microbial characterization of the same four batches using  classical culturing methods. great variability was recorded between batches by the pcr-dgge technique. this was also shown by culturing, and underlines the uniqueness of artisanal products. lactocococcus lactis subsp. lactis was dominant from the cheese milk stage until the end of ripening, whereas populations of certain lactobacillus species appeared during ripening. populations of species never isolated by culturing were found to be numerous by the pcr-dgge method, in  particular lactococcus garvieae and lactococcus raffinolactis. other, completely  unknown lactococci were also detected. the dominant eukaryotic populations from day 15 onwards were those of penicillium roqueforti and geotrichum candidum.

TI  == 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region polymorphism of lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis and lactococcus lactis as revealed by pcr and nucleotide sequence analysis.
AB  == the intergenic spacer region (isr) between the 16s and 23s rrna genes was tested  as a tool for differentiating lactococci commonly isolated in a dairy environment. 17 reference strains, representing 11 different species belonging to the genera lactococcus, streptococcus, lactobacillus, enterococcus and leuconostoc, and 127 wild streptococcal strains isolated during the whole fermentation process of "fior di latte" cheese were analyzed. after 16s-23s rdna  isr amplification by pcr, species or genus-specific patterns were obtained for most of the reference strains tested. moreover, results obtained after nucleotide analysis show that the 16s-23s rdna isr sequences vary greatly, in size and sequence, among lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis as well as other streptococci from dairy environments. because of the high degree of inter-specific polymorphism observed, 16s-23s rdna isr can be considered a good potential target for selecting species-specific molecular assays, such as pcr primer or probes, for a rapid and extremely reliable differentiation of dairy lactococcal isolates.

TI  == integrated polymerase chain reaction-based procedures for the detection and identification of species and subspecies of the gram-positive bacterial genus lactococcus.
AB  == aims: five species of the gram-positive bacterial genus lactococcus (lactococcus  lactis, l. garvieae, l. plantarum, l. piscium and l. raffinolactis) are currently recognized. the aim of this work was to develop a simple approach for the identification of these species, as well as to differentiate the industrially important dairy subspecies l. lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris. methods and results: methods were devised based on specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplifications that exploit differences in the sequences of the 16s ribosomal rna genes of each species, followed by restriction enzyme cleavage  of the pcr products. the techniques developed were used to characterize industrial cheese starter strains of l. lactis and the results were compared with biochemical phenotype and dna sequence data. conclusions: the pcr primers designed can be used simultaneously, providing a simple scheme for screening unknown isolates. strains of l. lactis show heterogeneity in the 16s ribosomal rna gene sequence. significance and impact of the study: this work provides an integrated set of methods for differentiation and identification of lactococcal species associated with agricultural, veterinary, medical and processed food industries.

TI  == isolation and characterization of carnobacterium, lactococcus, and enterococcus spp. from cooked, modified atmosphere packaged, refrigerated, poultry meat.
AB  == the microbiota of commercially produced, cooked and modified atmosphere packaged  poultry meat was followed during storage at 3.5 degrees c for up to 7 weeks. the  dominant microbiota consisted of lactococcus raffinolactis (117 isolates), carnobacterium divergens (61 isolates), carnobacterium piscicola (11 isolates), lactococcus garvieae (four isolates), lactococcus lactis (one isolate) and enterococcus faecalis (three isolates). all isolates were screened for production of bacteriocins. only c. piscicola isolates produced an inhibitory substance active against other lactic acid bacteria and against several listeria spp. species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers were used for the differentiation of carnobacterium, l. raffinolactis, l. lactis, and l. garvieae strains associated with the modified atmosphere packaged poultry products. no false pcr products were observed with other closely related bacterial species.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == identification of lactococcus garvieae by pcr.
AB  == lactococcus garvieae junior synonym enterococcus seriolicida) is an emerging zoonotic agent isolated from economically important fish (rainbow trout and yellowtail), from cattle, and from humans. clindamycin susceptibility is the only phenotypic test which can differentiate l. garvieae from lactococcus lactis, another emerging agent in humans. a pcr assay for the identification of l. garvieae was developed and resulted in an amplified fragment of 1,100 bp in size. the pcr assay was shown to be specific to l. garvieae. the pcr assay was positive for all the l. garvieae strains tested, which originated from three different continents (asia, australia, and europe). the pcr assay was negative for the phenotypically similar l. lactis and for all the other fish pathogens tested, including streptococcus iniae and aeromonas salmonicida. the pcr assay was applied to plasma obtained from diseased animals and was found sensitive enough to detect bacteria from 1 microl of plasma. the pcr assay that was developed is the only practical test besides the clindamycin test which can specifically identify the zoonotic agent l. garvieae and which can differentiate it from l. lactis.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of lactococcus lactis and lactococcus garvieae and a proposed method to discriminate between them.
AB  == the mics of antimicrobial agents contained in the sceptor streptococcus mic panels (becton dickinson microbiology systems) were determined for lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae, and unknown lactococcus species. several isolates had reduced susceptibilities to many of the antimicrobial agents contained in the panel. for l. garvieae, the mics of penicillin and, possibly, cephalothin were higher than for l. lactis, and unlike l. lactis, l. garvieae was resistant to clindamycin, indicating that knowledge of the lactococcus species causing an infection might influence the choice of antimicrobial therapy. susceptibility to  clindamycin can also be used to differentiate between l. lactis and l. garvieae.

TI  == differentiation of lactococcus lactis and lactococcus garvieae from humans by comparison of whole-cell protein patterns.
AB  == we tested 12 reference and 24 clinical strains of lactococci for physiologic characteristics using a conventional test system, the gen-probe enterococcus 2 chemiluminescence assay (gen-probe inc., san diego, calif.), the rapid strep identification system (analytab products, plainview, n.y.), and whole-cell protein analysis. the gen-probe enterococcus 2 chemiluminescence assay for enterococcus identification was negative with all strains. neither the conventional test nor the rapid strep identification system could differentiate between the two lactococcus spp. most commonly isolated from humans. a simple procedure, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was developed for comparing the whole-cell protein patterns of lactococcus spp. l. lactis and l. garvieae were differentiated by unique protein patterns.
