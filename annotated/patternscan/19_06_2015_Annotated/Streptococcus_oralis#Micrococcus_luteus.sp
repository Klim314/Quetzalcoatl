TI  == in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm  formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring  at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.

TI  == transient bacteremia after removal of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after the removal of a modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. methods: the sample consisted of 25 subjects (15 girls, 10 boys; mean  age, 14.4 years; range, 12.2-16.6 years). all subjects underwent rapid maxillary  expansion at the start of the orthodontic treatment with the same type of appliance. two 10-ml blood samples were taken, the first as a baseline and the second 3 minutes after removal of the appliance. all blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture system, and bacteria were identified by using conventional biochemical methods and api kits (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). results: overt soft-tissue bleeding was observed in 11 of the 25 patients during appliance removal, and 8 of 25 patients showed bacteremia after appliance removal. the data were analyzed with the fisher exact test. no statistically significant relationship was found between overt bleeding and bacteremia incidence (p = 0.054). conclusions: because transient bacteremia is caused by trauma from the removal of the modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when using splint-type tooth-and-tissue-borne rapid maxillary expansion appliances.
