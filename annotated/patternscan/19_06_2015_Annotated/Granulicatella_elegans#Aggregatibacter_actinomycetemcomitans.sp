TI  == coaggregation and biofilm growth of granulicatella spp. with fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: members of fastidious granulicatella and aggregatibacter genera belong to normal oral flora bacteria that can cause serious infections, such as infective endocarditis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has long been implicated in aggressive periodontitis, whereas dna-based methods only recently showed an association between granulicatella spp. and dental diseases. as bacterial coaggregation is a key phenomenon in the development of oral and nonoral multispecies bacterial communities it would be of interest knowing coaggregation pattern of granulicatella species with a. actinomycetemcomitans in  comparison with the multipotent coaggregator fusobacterium nucleatum. the aim was to investigate coaggregation and biofilm formation of granulicatella elegans and  granulicatella adiacens with a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum strains. results: f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher autoaggregation than all other test species, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans sa269 and g. elegans. a. actinomycetemcomitans cu1060 and g. adiacens did not autoaggregate. g. elegans with f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher coaggregation than most others, but failed to grow as biofilm together or separately. with f. nucleatum as partner, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains sa269, a rough-colony wild-type strain, and cu1060, a spontaneous smooth-colony laboratory variant, and g. adiacens were the next in coaggregation efficiency. these dual species combinations also were able to grow as biofilms. while both g. elegans and g. adiacens coaggregated with a. actinomycetemcomitans strain sa269,  but not with cu1060, they grew as biofilms with both a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. conclusions: g. elegans failed to form biofilm with f. nucleatum despite the strongest coaggregation with it. the ability of granulicatella spp. to coaggregate and/or form biofilms with f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains suggests that granulicatella spp. have the potential to integrate into dental plaque biofilms.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.
