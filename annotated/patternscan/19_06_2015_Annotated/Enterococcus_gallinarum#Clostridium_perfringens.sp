TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == mechanism of metronidazole-resistance by isolates of nitroreductase-producing enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus from the human intestinal  tract.
AB  == enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum strains resistant to metronidazole, nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone were isolated from fecal samples  of a patient with recurrent ulcerative colitis treated with metronidazole. unlike other metronidazole-resistant bacteria, these strains produced nitroreductase but metabolized metronidazole to compounds that could not be detected by liquid chromatography with uv or mass spectral analysis. metronidazole-susceptible clostridium perfringens grew equally well in spent cultures of enterococcus spp.  incubated with or without metronidazole. these data indicate that the nitroreductases produced by these enterococcus strains did not activate metronidazole to bactericidal metabolites and these bacteria may reduce the effectiveness of metronidazole. we have indirect evidence for an alternative pathway that results in metronidazole resistance. these strains of enterococcus had nitroreductase so resistance should not have occurred.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
