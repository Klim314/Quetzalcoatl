TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  - Dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (TR)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (TRD). This was diluted so that the antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. Microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers specific for the V2-V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rRNA gene (rDNA). Dominant isolates and PCR amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. TRD caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion of lactobacilli. DGGE indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria and showed that a Porphyromonas sp. and Selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by TRD. Pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Neisseria subflava, Prevotella nigrescens, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to TR, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least susceptible. Clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of TR activity. The mean MICs of TR, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin V, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5 days of exposure to TRD showed few significant changes. In conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to TRD showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  - Oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. Steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate-containing mouthwash (CHXM) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. The microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CHXM caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (P < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. The degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. DGGE showed that CHXM exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in Prevotella sp. and Selenomonas infelix. Pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to CHX, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. Determination of the MICs of triclosan, CHX, erythromycin, penicillin V, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of CHXM exposure, showed that CHXM exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to CHX (P < 0.05). Changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. In conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to CHXM represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - Biofilm dispersal of Neisseria subflava and other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria.
AB  - Polystyrene petri dishes containing liquid medium were inoculated with single-cell suspensions of a fresh clinical isolate of Neisseria subflava and were incubated under conditions of low vibration. N. subflava colonies grew firmly attached to the surface of the dish, while the broth remained clear. Growing colonies released cells into the medium, resulting in the appearance of 10(2) to 10(4) small satellite colonies attached to the surface of the dish in an area adjacent to each mature colony after 24 h. Satellite colonies grew in patterns of streamers shaped like jets and flares emanating from mature colonies and pointing toward the center of the dish. This dispersal pattern evidently resulted from the surface translocation of detached biofilm cells by buoyancy-driven convection currents that were generated due to slight temperature gradients in the medium. Streamers of satellite colonies ranged from 2 to >40 mm in length. Satellite colonies in very long streamers were relatively uniform in size regardless of their distance from the mature colony, suggesting that mature colonies released single cells or small clusters of cells into the medium and that the detachment, surface translocation, and subsequent surface reattachment of released cells were a transitory process. Incubation of N. subflava single cells in a perfused biofilm fermentor resulted in a large spike of the number of CFU in the perfusate after 9.5 h of growth, consistent with a rapid release of cells into the medium. Biofilm colonies of several other phylogenetically diverse oral bacteria, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Streptococcus mitis, and a prevalent but previously uncultured oral Streptococcus sp., exhibited similar temperature-dependent dispersal patterns in broth culture. This in vitro spreading phenotype could be a useful tool for studying biofilm dispersal in these and other nonflagellated bacteria and may have physiological relevance to biofilm dispersal in the oral cavity.
TI  - Evaluation of eight methods for identification of pathogenic Neisseria species: Neisseria-Kwik, RIM-N, Gonobio-Test, Minitek, Gonochek II, GonoGen, Phadebact Monoclonal GC OMNI Test, and Syva MicroTrak Test.
AB  - The performance of eight methods in identifying Neisseria species, particularly N. gonorrhoeae, was evaluated. These methods included four rapid carbohydrate utilization tests (Gonobio-Test, Neisseria-Kwik, RIM-N, and Minitek); the Gonochek II, a test which is based on the utilization of chromogenic substrates; and three monoclonal antibody tests (Syva MicroTrak, GonoGen, and Phadebact Monoclonal GC OMNI Test). In all, 182 isolates comprised in six species of Neisseria as well as Branhamella catarrhalis and Moraxella sp. were tested. Cystine-tryptic digest agar supplemented with sugars was included for reference purposes. In the carbohydrate utilization tests, the sensitivity and specificity of the Neisseria-Kwik and Minitek tests for the identification of N. gonorrhoeae were 100%. This compared with sensitivities and specificities, respectively, of 100 and 99.1% for the Gonobio-Test and 99.1 and 100% for cystine-tryptic digest agar sugars and the RIM-N test. The sensitivity and specificity of the Gonochek II test were 99.0 and 86.7%, respectively. Although most test kits did not claim to identify all Neisseria species, in several cases isolates of N. subflava were misidentified or could be misinterpreted as N. gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis. With the monoclonal reagents, the Syva MicroTrak system was 100% sensitive and 100% specific. The GonoGen test was both 99.1% sensitive and specific, while the Phadebact Monoclonal GC OMNI Test was 99.1% sensitive but 91.2% specific. With this latter test, cross-reactions were observed with strains of B. catarrhalis, N. cinerea, and N. lactamica.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Eleven aerobic species of Neisseria, a Mima sp., and a Herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) homology in direct hybridization experiments. DNA labeled with either (14)C or (32)P was prepared from five species of Neisseria. Unlabeled DNA from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled DNA (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 C. The measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous DNA. All serological types of N. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of N. meningitidis with one possible exception, type Z. The genus Neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae; second, N. perflava, N. subflava, N. sicca, N. flavescens, and N. flava; third, N. catarrhalis and N. caviae. Mima and Herellea species show no significant homology with the Neisseria.
