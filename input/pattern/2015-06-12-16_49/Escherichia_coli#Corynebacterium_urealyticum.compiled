TI  - Characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester C-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  - Prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  We characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. The subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. Cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. Microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. Microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include Actinomyces, Prevotella bivia, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of Streptococci, and Mycoplasma sp., including Ureaplasma urealyticum. These microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). Recovery of microorganisms from placental parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. The same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.
TI  - Encrusted cystitis in an immunocompromised patient: possible coinfection by Corynebacterium urealyticum and E. coli.
AB  - Encrusted cystitis is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the bladder characterized by excessively alkaline urine and calcifications within the bladder wall. A case of a 60 year-old man affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which developed encrusted cystitis due to Corynebacterium urealyticum with E. coli co-infection, shows that the treatment of encrusted cystitis with a endoscopic debulking of the encrusted stones and an antimicrobial therapy specific for C. urealyticum often is not sufficient for the complete resolution of symptoms.
TI  - [Bacteremia in 2 hospitals in Rosario, Argentina].
AB  - Bacteremia is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Nosocomial bacteremia is associated with an attributable mortality of 35%. In order to characterize the etiological agent of bacteremia cases during two time periods, 6605 patients were studied as follows: 1) from 1980 to 1982 (n = 2401) and 2) from 1988 to 2000 (n = 4204). A total of 596 cases of bacteremia were detected. The most frequent agents were Staphylococcus aureus, negative coagulase (CNS) Staphylococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. In the second period, an increase in the frequency of bacteremia caused by gram positive bacteria, particularly gram-positive cocci, was noted. Conversely, gram negative bacteria diminished significantly in the second period, specially enterobacterial species. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and CNS were significantly more frequently isolated in the second period. Infrequent agents of endocarditis, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, and Corynebacterium urealyticum, were isolated.
TI  - Role of genital mycoplasmata and other bacteria in urolithiasis.
AB  - Urease-producing bacteria have been shown to affect the formation of infection stones by splitting urea into ammonia, bicarbonate and carbonate. An increase in alkaline pH results in urinary supersaturation of the ions. The increase in ammonia also causes injury to the urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer. Non-urease-producing bacteria have been speculated to form urinary stones. Midstream voided bladder urine and fractured stone nidus samples from 72 patients undergoing surgery for urolithiasis were cultured on specific media for genital mycoplasmata and on conventional media. Urine samples were obtained from a control group of 40 healthy subjects. Genital mycoplasmata and other bacteria were evaluated with regard to the composition of urinary stones. Compared with other origins of stones, the relation between isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum and infection stone disease was statistically proven. Isolation of genital mycoplasmata was significantly higher in women than in men in the study group. The urinary stones comprised 84.7% calcium stones, 8.3% uric acid stones and 6.9% infection (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium spp., Enterobacterium spp. and U. urealyticum were cultured from stone samples. The results suggests that non-urease-producing bacteria, as well as urease-producing bacteria, may influence the formation of urinary stones.
TI  - Evaluation of broiler litter with reference to the microbial composition as assessed by using 16S rRNA and functional gene markers.
AB  - Very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. We evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by using a combination of culture and molecular detection. Total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) CFU/g of material. Enteric bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no Salmonella strains were detected by culture. In order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes amplified by PCR with microbial community DNA isolated from poultry litter as the template. From the 16S rDNA library, 31 genera were identified. Twelve families or groups were identified with lactobacilli and Salinococcus spp. forming the most abundant groups. In fact, 82% of the total sequences were identified as gram-positive bacteria with 62% of total belonging to low G+C gram-positive groups. In addition to detection of 16S rDNA sequences associated with the expected fecal bacteria present in manure, we detected many bacterial sequences for organisms, such as Globicatella sulfidofaciens, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Corynebacterium urealyticum, Clostridium aminovalericum, Arthrobacter sp., and Denitrobacter permanens, that may be involved in the degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. Several sequences were identified in the library for bacteria associated with disease in humans and poultry such as clostridia, staphylococci, and Bordetella spp. However, specific PCR targeting other human and veterinary pathogens did not detect the presence of Salmonella, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., Listeria spp., or toxigenic staphylococci. PCR and DNA hybridization revealed the presence of class 1 integrons with gene cassettes that specify resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. Only from understanding the microbial community of animal wastes such as poultry litter can we manage animal disease and limit the impact of animal waste on the environment and human and animal health.
TI  - Etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a Yemeni City.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Yemeni patients in Sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. METHODS: Consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in Sana'a city from 1990 to the end of 1999. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). RESULTS: The number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). The ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). The causative agents were mainly members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). Escherichia coli was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and Proteus species, 56 isolates (8%). The other pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Corynebacterium urealyticum and Enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). There was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. The isolation of Escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. Whereas Klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, Proteus species from 8% to 9%, Staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, Enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, Staphylococcus saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and Corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. Ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. CONCLUSION: The types of urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. It is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. It is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo study of stone formation by Corynebacterium group D2 (Corynebacterium urealyticum).
AB  - Corynebacterium group D2 inoculated into normal human urine formed struvite crystals and an increase in pH and ammonium concentration after 24 h of incubation. Zinc disks dipped into a broth culture of this microorganism and inserted into the bladders of rats produced stones with a mean weight of 12.5 mg (ranging from 1 to 57.7 mg) after 12 days. Analysis of the infrared spectrum determined the stones to be composed of struvite. From these results its seems that stone formation by Corynebacterium group D2 may be possible both in vitro and in vivo, which may confirm a previous report involving these bacteria in human clinical encrusted cystitis.
TI  - Culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  - To determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. Routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in the last 31 of the patients in this series. Of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with abnormal analyses. Fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for U. urealyticum. In reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution was the same regardless of the presence or absence of U. urealyticum. Antibiotic treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients despite conversion to a negative culture. Cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. There were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. Trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
