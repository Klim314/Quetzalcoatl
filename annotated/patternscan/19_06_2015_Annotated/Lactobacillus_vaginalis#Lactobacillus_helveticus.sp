TI  == naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria isolated from tomato pomace silage.
AB  == silage making has become a significant method of forage conservation worldwide. to determine how tomato pomace (tp) may be used effectively as animal feed, it was ensilaged for 90 days and microbiology counts, fermentation characteristics and chemical composition of tomato pomace silage (tps) were evaluated at the 30th, 60th, and 90th days, respectively. in addition, 103 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from tps. based on the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s rdna sequence and carbohydrate fermentation tests, the isolates were identified as 17 species namely: lactobacillus coryniformis subsp.  torquens (0.97%), lactobacillus pontis (0.97%), lactobacillus hilgardii (0.97%),  lactobacillus pantheris (0.97%), lactobacillus amylovorus (1.9%), lactobacillus panis (1.9%), lactobacillus vaginalis (1.9%), lactobacillus rapi (1.9%), lactobacillus buchneri (2.9%), lactobacillus parafarraginis (2.9%), lactobacillus helveticus (3.9%), lactobacillus camelliae (3.9%), lactobacillus fermentum (5.8%), lactobacillus manihotivorans (6.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (10.7%), lactobacillus harbinensis (16.5%) and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (35.0%). this study has shown that tp can be well preserved for 90 days by ensilaging and that tps is not only rich in essential nutrients, but that physiological and biochemical properties of the isolates could provide a platform for future design of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inoculants aimed at improving the fermentation quality of silage.

TI  == growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  == aims: the present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. methods and  results: strains of the individual lab isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kgy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. the od-time curves of  the lab strains during growth in flour extract or mrs (de man, rogosa and sharpe) broth were also determined. the maximum specific growth rates of lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial  sourdough. industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below ph 4.8. it was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the o(2) protective effect of rye  sourdough. conclusions: measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the lab strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. significance and impact of the study: isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method  for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia, uropathogenic escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. methods and results: the ks300 strain inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. after direct co-culture, data show that the lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. the adhering ks300 strain inhibited the adhesion of g. vaginalis dsm 4944 and uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 onto hela cells. moreover, the ks300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 within hela cells and s. typhimurium sl1344 within caco-2/tc7 cells. conclusions: the findings demonstrate that l. helveticus strain ks300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. significance and impact of the study: adhering l. helveticus strain ks300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a  strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial flora of sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == the microflora of a sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. the dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5)  cfu g-1. the spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum and lact. reuteri. the total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the ph dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. in this phase, only the latter two species remained dominant  in a ratio of 1:1. from the sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. sequence comparison of partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. five strains were classified as lact. vaginalis and could be regarded  as heterogeneous biovars of this species. the other two strains could be assigned to lact. helveticus. rapd-pcr and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.
