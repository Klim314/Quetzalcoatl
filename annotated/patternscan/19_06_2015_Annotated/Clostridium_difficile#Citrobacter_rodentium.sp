TI  == nfil3 is crucial for development of innate lymphoid cells and host protection against intestinal pathogens.
AB  == the bzip transcription factor nfil3 (also known as e4bp4) is required for the development of natural killer (nk) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ilc1s). we find that nfil3 plays a critical role in the development of other mucosal tissue-associated innate lymphocytes. type 3 ilcs (ilc3s), including lymphoid tissue inducer (lti)-like cells, are severely diminished in both numbers and function in nfil3-deficient mice. using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, we demonstrate that nfil3 is critical for normal development of gut-associated ilc3s in a cell-intrinsic manner. furthermore, nfil3 deficiency severely compromises intestinal innate immune defense against acute bacterial infection with citrobacter rodentium and clostridium difficile. nfil3 deficiency resulted in a loss of the recently identified ilc precursor, yet conditional ablation of nfil3  in the nkp46(+) ilc3 subset did not perturb ilc3 numbers, suggesting that nfil3 is required early during ilc3 development but not for lineage maintenance. lastly, a marked defect in type 2 ilcs (ilc2s) was also observed in the lungs and visceral adipose tissue of nfil3-deficient mice, revealing a general requirement  for nfil3 in the development of all ilc lineages.

TI  == mucin dynamics in intestinal bacterial infection.
AB  == background: bacterial gastroenteritis causes morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. murine citrobacter rodentium infection is a model for gastroenteritis  caused by the human pathogens enteropathogenic escherichia coli and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli. mucin glycoproteins are the main component of the first barrier that bacteria encounter in the intestinal tract. methodology/principal findings: using immunohistochemistry, we investigated intestinal expression of mucins (alcian blue/pas, muc1, muc2, muc4, muc5ac, muc13 and muc3/17) in healthy and c. rodentium infected mice. the majority of the c. rodentium infected mice developed systemic infection and colitis in the mid and distal colon by day 12. c. rodentium bound to the major secreted mucin, muc2, in  vitro, and high numbers of bacteria were found in secreted muc2 in infected animals in vivo, indicating that mucins may limit bacterial access to the epithelial surface. in the small intestine, caecum and proximal colon, the mucin  expression was similar in infected and non-infected animals. in the distal colonic epithelium, all secreted and cell surface mucins decreased with the exception of the muc1 cell surface mucin which increased after infection (p<0.05). similarly, during human infection salmonella st paul, campylobacter jejuni and clostridium difficile induced muc1 in the colon. conclusion: major changes in both the cell-surface and secreted mucins occur in response to intestinal infection.
