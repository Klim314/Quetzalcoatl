reduction of escherichia coli population following treatment with bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria and chelators.
the inhibitory activity of lactocin 705/al705 (2133 arbitrary units per ml (au ml(-1))), two bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus curvatus crl705 and nisin (1066au ml(-1)) produced by lactococcus lactis crl1109 in combination with chelating agents against escherichia coli strains in tsb medium at 21 and 6 degrees c was investigated. treatment with edta (500 and 1000 mm) and na lactate (800 mm) alone produced a variable effect depending on the strain, na lactate being inhibitory against e. coli nctc12900 at both assayed temperatures while edta (1000 mm) led to its inactivation only at 6 degrees c. direct and deferred strategies using edta and na lactate showed that the direct addition of bacteriocins and chelators was not as effective as compared to deferred treatments. when the deferred treatment effectiveness was evaluated at 6 degrees c, the use of edta (500 and 1000 mm) and na lactate (800 mm) in combination with lactocin 705/al705 demonstrated to be the most inhibitory strategy against both e. coli strains. nevertheless, treatments with chelators and bacteriocins was highly dependent upon strain sensitivity. permeabilization of the outer membrane of e. coli strains with edta and na lactate combined with lactocin 705/al705 showed to be valuable in controlling this foodborne bacteria at low temperatures.
cloning, sequencing, and expression in escherichia coli of lcnb, a third bacteriocin determinant from the lactococcal bacteriocin plasmid p9b4-6.
on the bacteriocin plasmid p9b4-6 of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 9b4, a third bacteriocin determinant was identified. the genes encoding bacteriocin production and immunity resided on a 1.2-kb celii-scai fragment and were located adjacent to one of two previously identified bacteriocin operons (m. j. van belkum, b. j. hayema, r. e. jeeninga, j. kok, and g. venema, appl. environ. microbiol. 57:492-498, 1991). the fragment was sequenced and analyzed by deletion and mutation analyses. the bacteriocin determinant consisted of two genes which were transcribed as an operon. the first gene (lcnb), containing 68 codons, was involved in bacteriocin activity. the second gene (lcib) contained 91 codons and was responsible for immunity. the specificity of this novel bacteriocin, designated lactococcin b, was different from that of the other two bacteriocins specified by p9b4-6. part of the nucleotide sequence of the lactococcin b operon was similar to a nucleotide sequence also found in the two other bacteriocin operons of p9b4-6. this conserved region encompassed a nucleotide sequence upstream of the bacteriocin gene and the 5' part of the gene. when the lactococcin b operon was expressed in escherichia coli by using a t7 rna polymerase-specific promoter, antagonistic activity could be detected.
