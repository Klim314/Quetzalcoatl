TI  == [quantitation of intestinal fusobacterium and butyrate- producing bacteria in patients with colorectal adenomas and colorectal cancer].
AB  == objective: to compare the abundance of 16s rrna gene of intestinal fusobacterium  and butyrate-producing bacteria in patients with colorectal adenomas patients and colorectal cancer and to reveal the correlation between the target bacteria and the development of colorectal cancer. methods: feces were collected from colorectal cancer patients (n=19), colorectal adenomas patients (n=12) and healthy subjects (n=19). bacteria genome dna from the fecal samples was used to quantitate the fusobacterium, two butyrate-producing bacteria eubacterium rectal, faecalibacterium prausnitzii and total bacteria by real-time polymerase chain reaction. then the variation of the target bacteria among different groups were assayed using mann-whitney u test. results: the abundance of fusobacterium was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than that in healthy subjects  (p = 0.000) and colorectal adenomas patients (p = 0.013), and it was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients than that in colorectal adenomas patients (p = 0.002). f. prausnitzii was significantly lower in colorectal adenomas patients compared to healthy subjects (p = 0.033). the total  bacteria count was significantly lower in the colorectal adenomas samples than that in the healthy samples (p = 0.002). there was no significantly difference of e. rectal between the three groups. conclusions: the shifts in the colonic bacterial population may potentially contribute to the development of colorectal  cancer.

TI  == enteric microbiota leads to new therapeutic strategies for ulcerative colitis.
AB  == ulcerative colitis (uc) is a leading form of inflammatory bowel disease that involves chronic relapsing or progressive inflammation. as a significant proportion of uc patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective therapies. the human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. there is a symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune  homeostasis. an imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of uc. a reduction of enteric microbiota diversity has been observed in uc patients, mainly affecting the butyrate-producing bacteria, such as faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which can repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. many studies have shown that enteric microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities, which can benefit uc patients. therefore, manipulation of the dysbiosis is an attractive approach for uc therapy. various therapies targeting a restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients with active and chronic forms of uc. such therapies include fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the  enteric microbiota. although there have been many large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. this review focuses on the important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric microbiota for uc.

TI  == microbiota and diabetes: an evolving relationship.
AB  == the gut microbiota affects numerous biological functions throughout the body and  its characterisation has become a major research area in biomedicine. recent studies have suggested that gut bacteria play a fundamental role in diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. data are accumulating in animal  models and humans suggesting that obesity and type 2 diabetes (t2d) are associated with a profound dysbiosis. first human metagenome-wide association studies demonstrated highly significant correlations of specific intestinal bacteria, certain bacterial genes and respective metabolic pathways with t2d. importantly, especially butyrate-producing bacteria such as roseburia intestinalis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii concentrations were lower in t2d subjects. this supports the increasing evidence, that butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids are able to exert profound immunometabolic effects. endotoxaemia, most likely gut-derived has also been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome and t2d and might play a key role in metabolic inflammation. a further hint towards an association between microbiota and t2d has been derived from studies in pregnancy showing that major gut microbial shifts occurring during pregnancy affect host metabolism. interestingly, certain antidiabetic drugs such as metformin also interfere with the intestinal microbiota. specific members of the microbiota such as akkermansia muciniphila might be decreased in diabetes and when administered to murines exerted antidiabetic effects. therefore, as a 'gut signature' becomes more evident in t2d, a better understanding of the role of the microbiota in diabetes might provide new aspects regarding its pathophysiological relevance and pave the way for new therapeutic principles.

TI  == increased proportions of bifidobacterium and the lactobacillus group and loss of  butyrate-producing bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota of persons with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has been described, but there are still varied reports on changes in the abundance of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus organisms in patients with ibd. the aim of this investigation was to compare the compositions of mucosa-associated and fecal bacteria in patients with ibd and in healthy controls (hcs). fecal and biopsy samples from 21 hcs, 21 and 15 crohn's disease (cd) patients, and 34 and 29 ulcerative colitis (uc) patients, respectively, were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr targeting the 16s rrna gene. the bacterial numbers were transformed into relative percentages for statistical analysis. the  proportions of bacteria were uniformly distributed along the colon regardless of  the disease state. bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the biopsy specimens of active uc patients compared to those in the hcs (4.6% versus 2.1%, p = 0.001), and the proportion of bifidobacterium was significantly higher in the biopsy specimens than in the fecal samples in active cd patients (2.7% versus 2.0%, p = 0.012). the lactobacillus group was significantly increased in the biopsy specimens of active cd patients compared to those in the hcs (3.4% versus  2.3%, p = 0.036). compared to the hcs, faecalibacterium prausnitzii was sharply decreased in both the fecal and biopsy specimens of the active cd patients (0.3%  versus 14.0%, p < 0.0001 for fecal samples; 0.8% versus 11.4%, p < 0.0001 for biopsy specimens) and the active uc patients (4.3% versus 14.0%, p = 0.001 for fecal samples; 2.8% versus 11.4%, p < 0.0001 for biopsy specimens). in conclusion, bifidobacterium and the lactobacillus group were increased in active  ibd patients and should be used more cautiously as probiotics during the active phase of ibd. butyrate-producing bacteria might be important to gut homeostasis.

TI  == a gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == starch structure modulates metabolic activity and gut microbiota profile.
AB  == normal maize starch and high amylose maize starch (has) either in native or thermally treated forms were used to investigate the effect of starch structure on the production of metabolites and gut microbiota profile using an anaerobic in vitro system. the changes in starch structure during fermentation were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (sem), high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (ftir). the native normal starch showed a porous structure during fermentation, indicating it was quickly metabolized by gut bacteria, whereas the has showed a smooth structure, suggesting it was utilized gradually. hplc chromatography showed that  amylose fraction with low molecular weight (mw) had a higher resistance to be fermented by gut bacteria than other starch molecular fractions. thermal treatment enhanced starch fermentation kinetics, especially for amylopectin and high mw amylose fractions. ftir analysis suggests that the structure of the normal starch, either in native or thermally treated, was less organized compared to has, and this structural character led to the normal starch to be utilized more quickly by gut bacteria with a faster increase in the ir ratio 1047/1022 cm(-1) (p < 0.01) during fermentation. the measurement of metabolic activity indicates that the normal starch with a less organized structure was utilized faster and generated more acetate and lactate during fermentation; has with a highly organized structure was more likely to produce butyrate, corresponding the significant increase (p < 0.001) in the populations of butyrate-producing strains (faecalibacterium prausnitzii and eubacterium hallii) in the cultures. this study reveals that fermentation kinetics of starch substrate is one of important characteristics for manipulating gut microbiota fermentation behaviours.

TI  == xylo-oligosaccharides and inulin affect genotoxicity and bacterial populations differently in a human colonic simulator challenged with soy protein.
AB  == high dietary intakes of some protein sources, including soy protein, can increase colonic dna damage in animals, whereas some carbohydrates attenuate this. we investigated whether inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) could be protective against dna strand breaks by adding them to a human colonic simulator consisting  of a proximal vessel (pv) (ph 5.5) and a distal vessel (dv) (ph 6.8) inoculated with human faeces and media containing soy protein. genotoxicity of the liquid phase and microbial population changes in the vessels were measured. soy protein  (3%) was fermented with 1% low amylose cornstarch for 10 day followed by soy protein with 1% xos or 1% inulin for 10 day. inulin did not alter genotoxicity but xos significantly reduced pv genotoxicity and increased dv genotoxicity. inulin and xos significantly increased butyrate concentration in the dv but not pv. numbers of the key butyrate-producing bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii  were significantly increased in the pv and dv by inulin but significantly decreased by xos in both vessels. other bacteria examined were also significantly impacted by the carbohydrate treatments or by the vessel (i.e., ph). there was a  significant overall inverse correlation between levels of damage induced by the ferments and levels of sulphate-reducing bacteria, bacteroides fragilis, and acetate. in conclusion, dietary xos can potentially modulate the genotoxicity of  the colonic environment and specific bacterial groups and short chain fatty acids may mediate this.

TI  == a decrease of the butyrate-producing species roseburia hominis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii defines dysbiosis in patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria play an important role in the onset and perpetuation of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). unlike in crohn's disease (cd), in which dysbiosis has been better characterised, in ulcerative colitis (uc), only small cohorts have been studied and showed conflicting data. therefore, we evaluated in a large cohort if the microbial signature described in cd is also present in uc, and if we could characterise predominant dysbiosis in uc. to assess the functional impact of dysbiosis, we quantified the bacterial metabolites. design: the predominant microbiota from 127 uc patients and 87 age and sex-matched controls was analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis. differences were quantitatively validated using  real-time pcr. metabolites were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. results: based on dgge analysis, the microbial signature previously described in cd was not present in uc. real-time pcr analysis revealed a lower abundance of roseburia hominis (p<0.0001) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p<0.0001) in uc patients compared to controls. both species showed an inverse correlation with disease activity. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) were reduced in uc patients (p=0.014), but no direct correlation between scfa and the identified  bacteria was found. conclusions: the composition of the fecal microbiota of uc patients differs from that of healthy individuals: we found a reduction in r hominis and f prausnitzii, both well-known butyrate-producing bacteria of the firmicutes phylum. these results underscore the importance of dysbiosis in ibd but suggest that different bacterial species contribute to the pathogenesis of uc and cd.

TI  == human gut microbiota changes reveal the progression of glucose intolerance.
AB  == to explore the relationship of gut microbiota with the development of type 2 diabetes (t2dm), we analyzed 121 subjects who were divided into 3 groups based on their glucose intolerance status: normal glucose tolerance (ngt; n = 44), prediabetes (pre-dm; n = 64), or newly diagnosed t2dm (n = 13). gut microbiota characterizations were determined with 16s rdna-based high-throughput sequencing. t2dm-related dysbiosis was observed, including the separation of microbial communities and a change of alpha diversity between the different glucose intolerance statuses. to assess the correlation between metabolic parameters and  microbiota diversity, clinical characteristics were also measured and a significant association between metabolic parameters (fpg, crp) and gut microbiota was found. in addition, a total of 28 operational taxonomic units (otus) were found to be related to t2dm status by the kruskal-wallis h test, most of which were enriched in the t2dm group. butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g. akkermansia muciniphila atccbaa-835, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii l2-6) had a higher abundance in the ngt group than in the pre-dm group. at genus level, the abundance of bacteroides in the t2dm group was only half that of the ngt and pre-dm groups. previously reported t2dm-related markers were also compared with the data in this study, and some inconsistencies were noted. we found that verrucomicrobiae may be a potential marker of t2dm as it had a significantly lower abundance in both the pre-dm and t2dm groups. in conclusion, this research  provides further evidence of the structural modulation of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diabetes.

TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == a diet high in resistant starch modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and gene expression in pig intestine.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) is highly fermentable by microbiota in the colon, resulting in the production of scfas. rs is thought to mediate a large proportion of its health benefits, including increased satiety, through the actions of scfas. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a diet high in rs on luminal  microbiota composition, luminal scfa concentrations, and the expression of host genes involved in scfa uptake, scfa signaling, and satiety regulation in mucosal  tissue obtained from small intestine, cecum, and colon. twenty adult female pigs  were either assigned to a digestible starch (ds) diet or a diet high in rs (34%)  for a period of 2 wk. after the intervention, luminal content and mucosal scrapings were obtained for detailed molecular analysis. rs was completely degraded in the cecum. in both the cecum and colon, differences in microbiota composition were observed between ds- and rs-fed pigs. in the colon these included the stimulation of the healthy gut-associated butyrate-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas potentially pathogenic members of the gammaproteobacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp., were reduced in relative abundance. cecal and colonic scfa concentrations were significantly greater in rs-fed pigs, and cecal gene expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (slc16a1) and glucagon (gcg) was induced by rs. in  conclusion, our data show that rs modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and host gene expression in pig intestine. combined, our data provide an enhanced understanding of the interaction between diet, microbiota, and host.

TI  == decreased colonization of fecal clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  == the mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). a recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the m-shime, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (hv) and six uc patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from uc patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. a more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale and clostridium leptum group, and counts of faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the uc samples. counts of roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the uc samples. qpcr analysis for butyryl-coa:acetate coa transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in  both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the uc samples. the m-shime model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to  the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from uc patients compared to hv.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. in order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase sequences from  faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% dna sequence identity to coa-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (otus). the four most prevalent otus corresponded to eubacterium  rectale, roseburia faecis, eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species ss2/1. the remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 otus that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (p=0.019) increases in faecalibacterium prausnitzii. because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their dna % g+c content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for pcr amplicons of  the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given  sample. this type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.

TI  == diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of butyrate-producing bacteria from the human large intestine.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. this review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. human colonic butyrate producers are gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to eubacterium rectale/roseburia spp. and to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-coa : acetate coa-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. here we suggest that these  mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. the roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. populations of f. prausnitzii are reported  to be decreased in crohn's disease, for example, while populations of roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific butyrate-producing bacteria, desulfovibrio and enterococcus faecalis in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background and aim: bacterial metabolites produced in the bowel are potentially related to the genesis of colorectal cancer. butyrate is protective against cancer, whereas hydrogen sulfide and oxygen free radicals can be toxic to the epithelium. the present study was designed to quantitate eubacterium rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii (both butyrate-producing bacteria), desulfovibrio (sulfate-reducing bacteria), and enterococcus faecalis (that produces extracellular superoxide) in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer. methods: dna was extracted from feces of 20 patients with colorectal cancer, nine patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 17 healthy volunteers. real-time  polymerase chain reaction using primers aimed at 16s rdna was used to quantitate  the above bacterial species or genus, and this was expressed relative to amplification of universal sequences conserved among all bacteria. results: levels of e. rectale and f. prausnitzii were decreased approximately fourfold (p  = 0.0088 and 0.0028, respectively) in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy control volunteers. levels of desulfovibrio were not significantly different between the three groups. e. faecalis populations were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0294). conclusions: butyrate producers were decreased and e. faecalis increased in the feces of colon cancer patients. these shifts in the colonic bacterial population  could potentially lead to epithelial cell damage and increased turnover and may be a factor leading to colon cancer.

TI  == high proportions of proinflammatory bacteria on the colonic mucosa in a young patient with ulcerative colitis as revealed by cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes.
AB  == the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (uc) remains unknown. it is thought to be  due to an abnormal and uncontrolled immune response to normally occurring constituents of the intestine. microbial agents appear to be involved in the pathogenesis and intestinal bacteria seem to be an important factor in the development and chronicity. the aim of this study was to investigate the colonic  microbiota of a patient with uc. the colonic tissues were taken during surgery from a 12-year-old girl suffering from uc. the microbiota on the colonic samples  was studied by cloning and sequencing of amplified 16s rrna genes. compared with  healthy subjects, alteration of the dominant bacterial group was observed in the  uc patient. we found a high incidence of enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides fragilis, and the single phylotype of the faecalibacterium prausnitzii-like "butyrate-producing bacterium" l2-6. furthermore, there was a substantial presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the present case of uc. the high proportion of adverse proinflammatory species is striking in the present case compared with  more normal situations. even if those bacteria are not the cause of the uc, they  most probably enhance the symptoms of the disease.

TI  == molecular profiling of the clostridium leptum subgroup in human fecal microflora  by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis.
AB  == a group-specific pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method  was developed and combined with group-specific clone library analysis to investigate the diversity of the clostridium leptum subgroup in human feces. pcr  products (length, 239 bp) were amplified using c. leptum cluster-specific primers and were well separated by dgge. the dgge patterns of fecal amplicons from 11 human individuals revealed host-specific profiles; the patterns for fecal samples collected from a child for 3 years demonstrated the structural succession of the  population in the first 2 years and its stability in the third year. a clone library was constructed with 100 clones consisting of 1,143-bp inserts of 16s rrna gene fragments that were amplified from one adult fecal dna with one forward universal bacterial primer and one reverse group-specific primer. eighty-six of the clones produced the 239-bp c. leptum cluster-specific amplicons, and the remaining 14 clones did not produce these amplicons but still phylogenetically belong to the subgroup. sixty-four percent of the clones were related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii (similarity, 97 to 99%), 6% were related to subdoligranulum variabile (similarity, approximately 99%), 2% were related to butyrate-producing bacterium a2-207 (similarity, 99%), and 28% were not identified at the species level. the identities of most bands in the dgge profiles for the same adult were determined by comigration analysis with the 86 clones that harbored the 239-bp group-specific fragments. our results suggest that dgge combined with clone library analysis is an effective technique for monitoring and analyzing the composition of this important population in the human gut flora.

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == design and validation of 16s rrna probes to enumerate members of the clostridium  leptum subgroup in human faecal microbiota.
AB  == among human faecal bacteria, many members of the clostridium leptum subgroup are  fibrolytic and butyrate producing microorganisms thereby contributing to processes important to colonic health. yet this phylogenetic subgroup remains poorly described to date. to improve detection and description of members of the  c. leptum subgroup, the clep 866 group probe was developed. its association with  probes targeting the clostridium viride cluster (cvir 1414) and eubacterium desmolans species (edes 635) allowed for the first time the detection of all members found in this phylogenetic group in human faecal microbiota. a species-specific probe was also designed to detect members of the ruminococcus callidus species (rcal 733). the design of signature regions was based on alignment of 16s rrna sequences isolated from faeces of five healthy adults. furthermore, an oligonucleotide competitor strategy was developed in order to improve the specificity of the probes formerly validated or designed in this study. the oligonucleotide probes were tested using a collection of target and non-target strains using fish combined with flow cytometry. these new probes were added to a panel of 18 phylogenetic probes selected to describe faecal microbiota composition in 21 human faeces of healthy adults. clostridium leptum subgroup represented 22% of the total faecal bacteria and codominated with members of clostridium coccoides group. the cluster faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the dominant component of the c. leptum subgroup and 20% of the latter subgroup remained unidentified at the species level.

AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == contribution of acetate to butyrate formation by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == acetate is normally regarded as an endproduct of anaerobic fermentation, but butyrate-producing bacteria found in the human colon can be net utilisers of acetate. the butyrate formed provides a fuel for epithelial cells of the large intestine and influences colonic health. [1-(13)c]acetate was used to investigate the contribution of exogenous acetate to butyrate formation. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia spp. grown in the presence of 60 mm-acetate and 10 mm-glucose derived 85-90 % butyrate-c from external acetate. this was due to rapid interchange between extracellular acetate and intracellular acetyl-coa, plus net acetate uptake. in contrast, a coprococcus-related strain that is a net  acetate producer derived only 28 % butyrate-c from external acetate. different carbohydrate-derived energy sources affected butyrate formation by mixed human faecal bacteria growing in continuous or batch cultures. the ranking order of butyrate production rates was amylopectin > oat xylan > shredded wheat > inulin > pectin (continuous cultures), and inulin > amylopectin > oat xylan > shredded wheat > pectin (batch cultures). the contribution of external acetate to butyrate formation in these experiments ranged from 56 (pectin) to 90 % (xylan) in continuous cultures, and from 72 to 91 % in the batch cultures. this is consistent with a major role for bacteria related to f. prausnitzii and roseburia spp. in butyrate formation from a range of substrates that are fermented in the large intestine. variations in the dominant metabolic type of butyrate producer between individuals or with variations in diet are not ruled out, however, and could influence butyrate supply in the large intestine.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes that detect quantitatively significant groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.
AB  == 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for butyrate-producing bacteria from human feces. three new cluster-specific probes detected bacteria related to roseburia intestinalis, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and eubacterium  hallii at mean populations of 2.3, 3.8, and 0.6%, respectively, in samples from 10 individuals. additional species-level probes accounted for no more than 1%, with a mean of 7.7%, of the total human fecal microbiota identified as butyrate producers in this study. bacteria related to e. hallii and the genera roseburia and faecalibacterium are therefore among the most abundant known butyrate-producing bacteria in human feces.

TI  == acetate utilization and butyryl coenzyme a (coa):acetate-coa transferase in butyrate-producing bacteria from the human large intestine.
AB  == seven strains of roseburia sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and coprococcus sp. from the human gut that produce high levels of butyric acid in vitro were studied with respect to key butyrate pathway enzymes and fermentation patterns. strains of roseburia sp. and f. prausnitzii possessed butyryl coenzyme a (coa):acetate-coa transferase and acetate kinase activities, but butyrate kinase  activity was not detectable either in growing or in stationary-phase cultures. although unable to use acetate as a sole source of energy, these strains showed net utilization of acetate during growth on glucose. in contrast, coprococcus sp. strain l2-50 is a net producer of acetate and possessed detectable butyrate kinase, acetate kinase, and butyryl-coa:acetate-coa transferase activities. these results demonstrate that different functionally distinct groups of butyrate-producing bacteria are present in the human large intestine.
