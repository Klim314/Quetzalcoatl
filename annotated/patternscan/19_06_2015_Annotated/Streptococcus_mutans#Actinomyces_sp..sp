TI  == a study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. methods: the bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar and bhi blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. results: the optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. there was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence  intensity and bacterial concentration. the mean optical density (mod) of s. mutans and l. acidophilus cultivated in bhi blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, p < 0.05). the mod of s. sanguis, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia cultivated in bhi blood agar was higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (37 +/-  12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, p > 0.05); the opposite was observed for c. albicans. conclusion: at 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic  bacteria. the fluorescence energy, q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI  == removal of dental biofilms with an ultrasonically activated water stream.
AB  == acidogenic bacteria within dental plaque biofilms are the causative agents of caries. consequently, maintenance of a healthy oral environment with efficient biofilm removal strategies is important to limit caries, as well as halt progression to gingivitis and periodontitis. recently, a novel cleaning device has been described using an ultrasonically activated stream (uas) to generate a cavitation cloud of bubbles in a freely flowing water stream that has demonstrated the capacity to be effective at biofilm removal. in this study, uas  was evaluated for its ability to remove biofilms of the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans ua159, as well as actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104 and streptococcus oralis atcc 9811, grown on machine-etched glass slides to generate  a reproducible complex surface and artificial teeth from a typodont training model. biofilm removal was assessed both visually and microscopically using high-speed videography, confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), and scanning electron microscopy (sem). analysis by cslm demonstrated a statistically significant 99.9% removal of s. mutans biofilms exposed to the uas for 10 s, relative to both untreated control biofilms and biofilms exposed to the water stream alone without ultrasonic activation (p < 0.05). the water stream alone showed no statistically significant difference in removal compared with the untreated control (p = 0.24). high-speed videography demonstrated a rapid rate (151 mm2 in 1 s) of biofilm removal. the uas was also highly effective at s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and s. oralis biofilm removal from machine-etched glass and s. mutans from typodont surfaces with complex topography. consequently, uas technology represents a potentially effective method for biofilm removal and improved oral hygiene.

TI  == co-aggregation of candida albicans, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans is candida albicans strain dependent.
AB  == microbial interactions are necessarily associated with the development of polymicrobial oral biofilms. the objective of this study was to determine the co-aggregation of eight strains of candida albicans with actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. in auto-aggregation assays, c. albicans strains were grown in rpmi-1640 and artificial saliva medium (asm) whereas bacteria were grown in heart infusion broth. c. albicans, a. naeslundii and s. mutans were suspended  to give 106 cells ml-1, 107 cells ml-1 and 108 cells ml-1, respectively, in co-aggregation buffer followed by a 1 h incubation. the absorbance difference at  620 nm (deltaabs) between 0 h and 1 h was recorded. to study co-aggregation, the  same protocol was used, except combinations of microorganisms were incubated together. the mean deltaabs% of auto-aggregation of the majority of rpmi-1640-grown c. albicans was higher than in asm-grown. co-aggregation of c. albicans with a. naeslundii and/or s. mutans was variable among c. albicans strains.. scanning electron microscopy images showed that a. naeslundii and s. mutans co-aggregated with c. albicans in dual- and tri-culture. in conclusion, the co-aggregation of c. albicans, a. naeslundii and s. mutans is c. albicans strain dependent.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific oral microflora - in vitro study.
AB  == aim: to determine and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific strains of oral microflora using a  standard diffusion method at full strength and 1:1 dilution at 24 h. materials and methods: the standard strains of streptococcus. mutans (atcc 21293), streptococcus sangius (mtcc 442), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 3268), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 2592), streptococcus pyogenes (mtcc 442) and candida  albicans (atcc 183) were obtained. antimicrobial efficacy of the dentifrices was  tested in triplicate, at full strength and 1:1 dilution with the sterile water using a standard diffusion method for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the antimicrobial efficacy was tested by observing the zones of inhibition in millimeters surrounding disk containing the dentifrice. mean standard deviation and standard  error of mean of the inhibitory zones was calculated for each herbal dentifrice.  p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: danth kanthi (dk) was the most effective against all the microorganisms producing larger zones of inhibition at 24 h (f.s - 40+/-1.5; 1:1 dilution - 40+/-2.71). amar premium (ap)  also produced larger zones of inhibition against all microorganisms except s. aureus. of all the dentifrices, least zones of inhibitions i.e., around 5 mm was  observed against s. aureus by amar premium (ap) and dabur babool (db) at 24 h. conclusion: based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that all herbal dentifrices exhibited antimicrobial activity against the selected oral microorganisms, with dk being the most effective. hence, it can be inferred that  herbal dentifrices can also be recommended like the conventional formulations.

TI  == maturation of oral microbiota in children with or without dental caries.
AB  == background: the aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the oral microbiota in children from age 3 months to 3 years, and to determine the association of the presence of caries at 3 years of age. methods and findings: oral biofilms and saliva were sampled from children at 3 months (n = 207) and 3 years (n = 155) of age, and dental caries was scored at 3 years of age. oral microbiota was assessed by culturing of total lactobacilli and mutans streptococci, pcr detection of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, 454 pyrosequencing and homim (human oral microbe identification microarray) microarray detection of more then 300 species/ phylotypes. species richness and taxa diversity significantly increased from 3 months to 3 years. three bacterial  genera, present in all the 3-month-old infants, persisted at 3 years of age, whereas three other genera had disappeared by this age. a large number of new taxa were also observed in the 3-year-olds. the microbiota at 3 months of age, except for lactobacilli, was unrelated to caries development at a later age. in contrast, several taxa in the oral biofilms of the 3-year-olds were linked with the presence or absence of caries. the main species/phylotypes associated with caries in 3-year-olds belonged to the actinobaculum, atopobium, aggregatibacter,  and streptococcus genera, whereas those influencing the absence of caries belonged to the actinomyces, bergeyella, campylobacter, granulicatella, kingella, leptotrichia, and streptococcus genera. conclusions: thus, during the first years of life, species richness and taxa diversity in the mouth increase significantly. besides the more prevalent colonization of lactobacilli, the composition of the overall microbiota at 3 months of age was unrelated to caries development at a later age. several taxa within the oral biofilms of the 3-year-olds could be linked to the presence or absence of caries.

TI  == comparison of oral microbial profiles between children with severe early childhood caries and caries-free children using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == objective: early childhood caries (ecc) has become a prevalent public health problem among chinese preschool children. the bacterial microflora is considered  to be an important factor in the formation and progress of dental caries. however, high-throughput and large-scale studies of the primary dentition are lacking. the present study aimed to compare oral microbial profiles between children with severe ecc (secc) and caries-free children. methods: both saliva and supragingival plaque samples were obtained from children with secc (n = 20) and caries-free children (n = 20) aged 3 to 4 years. the samples were assayed using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). results: a total  of 379 bacterial species were detected in both the saliva and supragingival plaque samples from all children. thirteen (including streptococcus) and two (streptococcus and actinomyces) bacterial species in supragingival plaque and saliva, respectively, showed significant differences in prevalence between the two groups. of these, the frequency of streptococcus mutans detection was significantly higher in both saliva (p = 0.026) and plaque (p = 0.006) samples from the secc group than in those from the caries-free group. conclusions: the findings of our study revealed differences in the oral microbiota between the secc and caries-free groups several genera, including streptococcus, porphyromonas, and actinomyces, are strongly associated with secc and can be potential biomarkers of dental caries in the primary dentition.

TI  == highly efficient antibacterial surface grafted with a triclosan-decorated poly(n-hydroxyethylacrylamide) brush.
AB  == this work presented a highly efficient antibacterial ti-surface which was grafted with poly(n-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (pheaa) brush and further decorated with triclosan (tcs). the modified surfaces were characterized using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and attenuated total reflectance  fourier transform infrared. the antibacterial performance of the modified surfaces was evaluated using the streptococcus mutans and actinomyces naeslundii  attachment test. the ti surface with pheaa brush (ti-pheaa) was able to resist the adhesion of the bacteria, while the tcs-decorated ti surface (ti-tcs) showed  the capability of killing the bacteria adhered on the surface. as we coupled the  tcs to the pheaa brush, the surface showed highly efficient antibacterial performance due to the combination of the resistance to the bacteria adhesion and its activity of killing bacteria.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == pulp and plaque microbiotas of children with severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial invasion into pulps of primary teeth can lead to infection and premature tooth loss in children. this pilot study aimed to explore whether the microbiota of carious exposures of dental pulps resembles that of carious dentin or that of infected root canals. design: children with severe early childhood caries were studied. children were consented and extent of caries, plaque, and gingivitis measured. bacteria were sampled from carious lesion biofilms and vital carious exposures of pulps, and processed by anaerobic  culture. isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16s rrna gene  and identified by comparison with taxa in the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.org). the microbiotas of carious lesions and dental pulps were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. results: the microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. the major taxa identified belonged to the phyla firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and actinobacteria (mainly actinomyces species). actinomyces and selenomonas species  were associated with carious lesions whereas veillonella species, particularly veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. other bacteria detected in pulps included streptococcus mutans, parascardovia denticolens, bifidobacterium longum, and several lactobacillus and actinomyces species. by principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. conclusions: we conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. vital primary pulps had a dominant firmicutes and actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. the microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species at the forefront of caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy.

TI  == rapid and sensitive pcr-dipstick dna chromatography for multiplex analysis of the oral microbiota.
AB  == a complex of species has been associated with dental caries under the ecological  hypothesis. this study aimed to develop a rapid, sensitive pcr-dipstick dna chromatography assay that could be read by eye for multiplex and semiquantitative analysis of plaque bacteria. parallel oligonucleotides were immobilized on a dipstick strip for multiplex analysis of target dna sequences of the caries-associated bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, scardovia wiggsiae, actinomyces species, and veillonella parvula. streptavidin-coated blue-colored latex microspheres were to generate signal. target dna amplicons with an oligonucleotide-tagged terminus and a biotinylated terminus were coupled with latex beads through a streptavidin-biotin interaction  and then hybridized with complementary oligonucleotides on the strip. the accumulation of captured latex beads on the test and control lines produced blue  bands, enabling visual detection with the naked eye. the pcr-dipstick dna chromatography detected quantities as low as 100 pg of dna amplicons and demonstrated 10- to 1000-fold higher sensitivity than pcr-agarose gel electrophoresis, depending on the target bacterial species. semiquantification of bacteria was performed by obtaining a series of chromatograms using serial 10-fold dilution of pcr-amplified dna extracted from dental plaque samples. the assay time was less than 3 h. the semiquantification procedure revealed the relative amounts of each test species in dental plaque samples, indicating that this disposable device has great potential in analysis of microbial composition in the oral cavity and intestinal tract, as well as in point-of-care diagnosis of microbiota-associated diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lactobacillus reuteri on cariogenic bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, and periodontal diseases actinomyces naeslundii and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well known for their beneficial effects on human health in the intestine and immune system; however, there are few studies on the  impact they can generate in oral health. the aim of this study was to test and compare in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. reuteri on pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental caries: s. mutans, s. gordonii, and periodontal disease: a. naeslundii and t. forsythia. also, we determined the growth kinetics of each bacterium involved in this study. before determining the  antimicrobial action of l. reuteri on cariogenic bacteria and periodontal disease, the behavior and cell development time of each pathogenic bacterium were studied. once the conditions for good cell growth of each of selected pathogens were established according to their metabolic requirements, maximum exponential growth was determined, this being the reference point for analyzing the development or inhibition by lab using the kirby bauer method. chlorhexidine 0.12 % was positive control. l. reuteri was shown to have an inhibitory effect against s. mutans, followed by t. forsythia and s. gordonii, and a less significant effect against a. naeslundii. regarding the effect shown by l. reuteri on the two major pathogens, we consider its potential use as a possible functional food in the prevention or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of gaseous and aqueous ozone on caries pathogen microorganisms grown in biofilms.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the anti-microbial effect of gaseous and aqueous ozone on biofilms of caries pathogen microorganisms with regard to concentration and time  dependency. methods: biofilm cultures of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus paracasei were grown on nitro-cellulose-membranes for 48 hours. the membranes were cut into equal-sized pieces and exposed to chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) (positive control; 0.1-20%), gaseous (1-64 g m3)  and aqueous ozone (1.25-20 microg ml(-1)) for 60 seconds. the influence of exposure time (30-120 seconds) was tested for exemplary concentrations of the three agents. colony forming units of bacteria were counted. the bacteria survival rate was given as percentage of the negative control (pbs for chx/aqueous ozone, ambient air for gaseous ozone). results: there was no difference in bacterial reduction of different species with general reduction close to zero for high concentrations of all agents. univariate anova with partial eta-squared (eta2) statistics showed major effects for concentration/contact time of the agent on bacteria survival. high concentrated gaseous and aqueous ozone seem to be potential alternatives to chx with equivalent antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == evaluation of a new oral health scale of infectious potential based on the salivary microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. patients and methods: the oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. results: in comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., fusobacterium spp. and prevotella gingivalis). in comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (cfu/ml log10) of facultative  anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (s. mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter spp. and fusobacterium spp.). conclusion: our  new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and  quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the  saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. clinical relevance: our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.

TI  == the oral microbiome in dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common chronic and multifactorial diseases affecting the human population. the appearance of a caries lesion is determined by the coexistence of three main factors: acidogenic and acidophilic microorganisms, carbohydrates derived from the diet, and host factors. socio-economic and behavioral factors also play an important role in the etiology of the disease. caries develops as a result of an ecological imbalance in the stable oral microbiom. oral microorganisms form dental plaque on the surfaces of  teeth, which is the cause of the caries process, and shows features of the classic biofilm. biofilm formation appears to be influenced by large scale changes in protein expression over time and under genetic control cariogenic microorganisms produce lactic, formic, acetic and propionic acids, which are a product of carbohydrate metabolism. their presence causes a decrease in ph level  below 5.5, resulting in demineralization of enamel hydroxyapatite crystals and proteolytic breakdown of the structure of tooth hard tissues. streptococcus mutans, other streptococci of the so-called non-mutans streptococci group, actinomyces and lactobacillus play a key role in this process. dental biofilm is  a dynamic, constantly active metabolically structure. the alternating processes of decrease and increase of biofilm ph occur, which are followed by the respective processes of de- and remineralisation of the tooth surface. in healthy conditions, these processes are in balance and no permanent damage to the tooth enamel surface occurs.

TI  == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years.  molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers,  were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious  lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

TI  == s-aryl-l-cysteine sulphoxides and related organosulphur compounds alter oral biofilm development and ai-2-based cell-cell communication.
AB  == aims: to design and synthesize a library of structurally related, small molecules related to homologues of compounds produced by the plant petiveria alliacea and determine their ability to interfere with ai-2 cell-cell communication and biofilm formation by oral bacteria. many human diseases are associated with persistent bacterial biofilms. oral biofilms (dental plaque) are problematic as they are often associated with tooth decay, periodontal disease and systemic disorders such as heart disease and diabetes. methods and results: using a microplate-based approach, a bio-inspired small molecule library was screened for anti-biofilm activity against the oral species streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sanguis 10556 and actinomyces oris mg1. to complement the static screen, a flow-based bioflux microfluidic system screen was also performed under  conditions representative of the human oral cavity. several compounds were found  to display biofilm inhibitory activity in all three of the oral bacteria tested.  these compounds were also shown to inhibit bioluminescence by vibrio harveyi and  were thus inferred to be quorum sensing (qs) inhibitors. conclusion: due to the structural similarity of these compounds to each other, and to key molecules in ai-2 biosynthetic pathways, we propose that these molecules potentially reduce biofilm formation via antagonism of qs or qs-related pathways. significance and impact of the study: this study highlights the potential for a non-antimicrobial-based strategy, focused on ai-2 cell-cell signalling, to control the development of dental plaque. considering that many bacterial species use ai-2 cell-cell signalling, as well as the increased concern of the use of antimicrobials in healthcare products, such an anti-biofilm approach could also be used to control biofilms in environments beyond the human oral cavity.

AB  == objective: to investigate the formation of biofilms on the surface of materials applied for the fabrication of implant abutments. material and methods: specimens were prepared from the implant abutment materials titanium, zirconia, and polyetheretherketone (peek); specimens made from polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) were used for reference. all specimens were polished to high gloss using silicon  carbide paper; surface roughness was determined using profilometry, and surface free energy was calculated from contact angle measurements. after the simulation  of salivary pellicle formation, multispecies biofilm formation was initiated by exposing the specimens to a suspension of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans for either 20 or 44 h. viable microbial biomass adherent to the specimens (n = 10 per material and incubation time) and the percentage of dead microorganisms in the different biofilms (n = 5, accordingly) were determined. results: significantly lower surface roughness was identified for peek and pmma than for zirconia and titanium (p < 0.001); surface free energy was significantly lower for zirconia than for peek (p = 0.038). significantly higher viable biomass and a significantly higher  percentage of dead microorganisms were identified after 44 h than after 20 h of biofilm formation (p < 0.001, respectively); after 20 h, peek surfaces harbored significantly lower viable biomass than the surfaces of the other materials (p <  0.0125). after 44 h, significant differences were identified in the percentage of dead microorganisms organized in the biofilms on the different materials (p = 0.012). conclusions: within the limitations of a laboratory study, the results suggest that biofilm formation on the surface of peek is equal or lower than on the surface of conventionally applied abutment materials such as zirconia and titanium. however, clinical studies are necessary to corroborate these preliminary results.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

TI  == effect of a novel quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) on adhesion and antibacterial properties of dental adhesives.
AB  == this study investigated the resin-dentin bond strength (mutbs), degree of conversion (dc), and antibacterial potential of an innovative adhesive system containing a quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) using in situ and in vitro assays. forty-two human third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and were randomly distributed into three groups of self-etching adhesive  systems: clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp (experimental group), clearfil protect bond (positive control) and clearfil se bond (negative control). after light curing, three 1 mm-increments of composite resin were bonded to each dentin surface. a total of thirty of these bonded teeth (10 teeth per group) was sectioned to obtain stick-shaped specimens and tested under tensile stress immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of storage in distilled water. twelve bonded teeth (4 teeth per group) were longitudinally sectioned in a mesio-to-distal direction to obtain resin-bonded dentin slabs. in situ dc was evaluated by micro-raman spectroscopy. in vitro dc of thin films of each adhesive system was measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. in vitro susceptibility tests of these three adhesive systems were performed by the minimum inhibitory/minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc) assays against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces naeslundii. no statistically significant difference in mutbs was observed between clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp and clearfil se bond (p>0.05) immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of water storage. however clearfil protect bond showed a significant reduction of mutbs after 12 months of storage (p=0.039). in addition, qamp provided no significant change in dc after incorporating into clearfil se bond (p>0.05). clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp demonstrated mic/mbc values similar to the positive control against l. casei and a. naeslundii and higher than the negative control for all evaluated bacterial strains. the use of qamp in an adhesive system demonstrated effective bond strength, a suitable degree of conversion, and adequate antibacterial effects against oral bacteria, and may be  useful as a new approach to provide long-lasting results for dental adhesives.

TI  == an investigation of the effect of scaling-induced surface roughness on bacterial  adhesion in common fixed dental restorative materials.
AB  == statement of problem: bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. however, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. purpose: the purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. material and methods: forty specimens each of type iii gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. the specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. surface treatments in each  group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. in turn, the specimens were inoculated with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus. bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. the specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 ml of sterile saline. the solution was plated and quantified. scanning electron microscopy was performed. the statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor anova with a bonferroni correction. results: the surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 ra) (p<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 ra) (p<.01). the results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. a quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. in spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (p<.05). instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (p<.05). conclusions: the results of this investigation indicate that type iii gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial  adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == a three-species biofilm model for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization.
AB  == although streptococcus mutans biofilms have been useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates and the effects of fluoride on dental demineralization, a more appropriate biofilm should be developed to demonstrate the influence of other oral bacteria on cariogenic biofilms. this study describes the development and validation of a three-species biofilm model comprising streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus gordonii for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization after cariogenic challenges and fluoride exposure. single- or three-species biofilms were developed on dental substrata for 96 h, and biofilms were exposed to feast and famine episodes. the three-species biofilm model produced a large biomass, mostly comprising s. mutans (41%) and s. gordonii (44%), and produced significant demineralization in the dental substrata, although enamel demineralization was decreased by fluoride treatment. the findings indicate that the three-species biofilm model may be useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates other than sucrose and determining the effects of fluoride on dental substrata.

TI  == hiv infection and microbial diversity in saliva.
AB  == limited information is available about the effects of hiv and subsequent antiretroviral treatment on host-microbe interactions. this study aimed to determine the salivary microbial composition for 10 hiv-seropositive subjects, before and 6 months after highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart), compared  with that for 10 hiv-seronegative subjects. a conventional culture and two culture-independent analyses were used and consistently demonstrated differences  in microbial composition among the three sets of samples. hiv-positive subjects had higher levels of total cultivable microbes, including oral streptococci, lactobacilli, streptococcus mutans, and candida, in saliva than did hiv-negative  subjects. the total cultivable microbial levels were significantly correlated with cd4+ t cell counts. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), which compared the overall microbial profiles, showed distinct fingerprinting profiles  for each group. the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) assay, which compared the 16s rrna genes, showed clear separation among the three sample groups. veillonella, synergistetes, and streptococcus were present in all 30 saliva samples. only minor changes or no changes in the prevalence of neisseria,  haemophilus, gemella, leptotrichia, solobacterium, parvimonas, and rothia were observed. seven genera, capnocytophaga, slackia, porphyromonas, kingella, peptostreptococcaceae, lactobacillus, and atopobium, were detected only in hiv-negative samples. the prevalences of fusobacterium, campylobacter, prevotella, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, actinomyces, granulicatella, and atopobium were increased after haart. in contrast, the prevalence of aggregatibacter was significantly decreased after haart. the findings of this study suggest that hiv infection and haart can have significant effects on salivary microbial colonization and composition.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, streptococcus mutans.
AB  == although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, s. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. during the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against s. mutans. early attempts used fixed whole cells of s. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of s. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. in this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against s. mutans.

AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == effects of maltitol and xylitol chewing-gums on parameters involved in dental caries development.
AB  == aim: the effects on plaque parameters of sugar free chewing-gums (cg) sweetened with either maltitol or xylitol were assessed to better understand the role polyols can play in dental caries prevention. materials and methods: a double-blind, parallel, randomised, controlled study was conducted in china. subjects (n = 258, age = 13 to 15 years-old) were divided into 4 groups: 2 receiving polyols cg, containing respectively maltitol or xylitol, a group receiving gum base (placebo) and a negative control group not receiving any gum.  cg were chewed for 30 days. this corresponds to a 10 g consumption of polyol per  day. plaque parameters (growth, ph, bacteria and insoluble glucans) were evaluated throughout the experimental period. results: all parameters studied were significantly modified with gum base compared to no-gum: plaque ph increased; plaque growth, bacteria (s. mutans, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus and lactobacillus) and insoluble glucans decreased. maltitol and xylitol cg led similarly to a higher plaque ph (auc, p=/<0.05) on short (at baseline after the first cg consumption) and long term (after 4 weeks of daily cg consumption), with or without saliva stimulation compared to both control and placebo groups. they led to a decrease in plaque growth (p=0.02) over the experimental period compared to controls. moreover, they significantly reduced the concentration of 4 cariogenic bacteria species (p=/<0.05) in dental plaque compared to gum base. conclusion: sugar free cg sweetened with either maltitol or xylitol can similarly reduce plaque acidogenicity compared to gum base through a decrease in oral bacteria presence. the use of a gum base placebo allowed to isolate effects on parameters involved in dental caries development specific to maltitol and xylitol, and to show these effects were similar.

TI  == characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
AB  == background: lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri. results: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) fraction (47 out of 90). lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of lactobacillus positive infants) of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite,  and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and muc7, and purified mfgm, and adhered to  epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in 29.7% of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri (2.14 pg/ul) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/ul) or mfgm (0.697 pg/ul) formula. conclusions: lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.

TI  == a high-sensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for evaluating bacterial adhesion to denture materials.
AB  == oral bacteria adhered to dental material surfaces are known to cause various oral diseases. this study aimed to develop a highsensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for quantification of oral bacteria (streptococcus, actinomyces and veillonella) adhered to denture material surfaces. the amount of  adhered bacteria was estimated from the fluorescence intensity derived from resazurin, which is reduced by bacterial metabolic reactions. the addition of bacterial metabolic substrates (glucose for streptococcus and actinomyces and sodium lactate for veillonella) to the reaction mixture increased the fluorescence intensity by 2.3-110 times, subsequently improved the sensitivity. furthermore, an experimental device having silicon wells containing test material was carefully designed for accurate quantification of bacteria adhered to test materials. the improved resazurin method using a new experimental device successfully enabled the quantification of bacterial adhesion to polymethyl methacrylate and other three conventional denture materials.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

AB  == quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silicate (qams), an organically modified silicate (ormosil) functionalized with polymerizable methacrylate groups and an antimicrobial agent with a long lipophilic alkyl chain quaternary ammonium group, was synthesized through a silane-based sol-gel route. by dissolving qams in methyl methacrylate monomer, this ormosil molecule was incorporated into an auto-polymerizing, powder/liquid orthodontic acrylic resin system, yielding qams-containing poly(methyl methacrylate). the qams-containing acrylic resin showed a predominant contact-killing effect on streptococcus mutans (atcc 35668)  and actinomyces naeslundii (atcc 12104) biofilms, while inhibiting adhesion of candida albicans (atcc 90028) on the acrylic surface. the antimicrobial activities of qams-containing acrylic resin were maintained after a 3month water-aging period. bromophenol blue assay showed minimal leaching of quaternary  ammonium species when an appropriate amount of qams (<4wt.%) was incorporated into the acrylic resin. the results suggest that qams is predominantly co-polymerized with the poly(methyl methacrylate) network, and only a minuscule amount of free qams molecules is present within the polymer network after water-aging. acrylic resin with persistent antimicrobial activities represents a  promising method for preventing bacteria- and fungus-induced stomatitis, an infectious disease commonly associated with the wearing of removable orthodontic  appliances.

TI  == high strength re-mineralizing, antibacterial dental composites with reactive calcium phosphates.
AB  == objective: development of high strength dental composites with adhesive, antibacterial and re-mineralizing potential. materials: urethane and triethylene  glycol dimethacrylates were combined with hema (10 or 20wt%) and 2mp (2 or 10wt%), antibacterial chlorhexidine (2.5wt%) and chemical cure initiators. reactive mono/tri calcium phosphate (cp) mixed with silica/silicon carbide nanoparticles (s) (cp:s weight ratio 1:2 or 2:1) was added (50wt%). results: decreasing cp/s ratio and hema content reduced monomer conversion at 15min from 93 to 63%. conversely, decreasing cp/s increased initial "dry" compressive (137-203mpa) and flexural (79-116mpa) strength. with high hema content, these decreased by approximately 15-20mpa upon 24h water storage. with low hema content, average decline was <8mpa due to reduced water sorption. early water sorption induced mass increase, volume expansion, mono calcium phosphate dissolution and chlorhexidine release, were proportional to the initial calcium phosphate content. furthermore, they increased approximately 1.5 fold upon raising hema wt%. these diffusion controlled processes and strength decline slowed after 24h as phosphates reaction bound water within the materials. increasing 2mp concentration reduced calcium release but did not affect strength. formulations with high cp/s indicated greater antibacterial activity in agar diffusion and in vitro biofilm tests. significance: new material use beneath a conventional composite could potentially reduce high failure rates associated with residual caries and bacterial microleakage.

TI  == dynamic changes in the initial colonization of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii using a new animal model.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii are the predominant bacteria and initial colonizers of oral microflora. the binding of a. naeslundii and s. gordonii and the interaction between them on the salivary pellicle-coated tooth surface play an important role in the biofilm development. recently, we reported  that nod/scid.e2f1(-) mice are a useful model for studying oral biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans on the tooth surface. in this study, we aimed to determine whether nod/scid.e2f1(-) mice can be used for studying oral colonization of a. naeslundii and s. gordonii. colonization of a. naeslundii in mice fed with 1% sucrose water for 24 h before inoculation was higher than that among mice fed with sucrose water for 1 h. a. naeslundii colonization using mixed species-inoculation was lower than that using single-species inoculation 30-90 min after inoculation; however, the colonization was higher 120-180 min after inoculation. the mixed inoculation induced better colonization of s. gordonii than single-species inoculation 60-180 min after inoculation. polyclonal and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody stained bacteria showed better colonization of s. gordonii when a mixed culture is used in vivo. nod/scid.e2f1(-) mice were useful for studying the initial colonization of a. naeslundii and s. gordonii. long-term supply of sucrose water creates a favorable environment for the initial colonization of a. naeslundii that, in turn, supports the colonization of s. gordonii.

TI  == identification of organic acids in cichorium intybus inhibiting virulence-related properties of oral pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the low molecular mass (lmm) extract of cichorium intybus var. silvestre (red chicory) has been shown to inhibit virulence-linked properties of oral pathogens  including streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and prevotella intermedia. in the present study hplc-dad-esi/ms(2) was used to investigate the compounds contained in this extract for their anti-virulence activity. the extract contained a number of components, including oxalic, succinic, shikimic and quinic acids, which interfere with the growth and virulence traits (i.e., biofilm formation, adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite) of oral pathogens involved in gingivitis and tooth decay. succinic and quinic acid seem to be the most potent, mainly by interfering with the ability of oral pathogens to form biofilms (either through inhibition of their development or promotion of their disruption). our findings suggest that one or more of these compounds may modulate plaque formation in vivo, which is a prerequisite for the development of both caries and gingivitis.

TI  == the in vitro study of ursolic acid and oleanolic acid inhibiting cariogenic microorganisms as well as biofilm.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to examine the effect of ursolic acid (ua) and oleanolic acid (oa), triterpenoid compounds that are isolated from many edible and medicinal plants, on cariogenic microorganisms and biofilms. methods:  a microtitre plate dilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ua and oa against two actinomyces spp. and four streptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of ua and oa was assessed by crystal violet staining, scanning electron  microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: ua and oa displayed differential antibacterial activities against the six tested bacteria, with ua showing greater antibacterial activity than oa. furthermore, the two drugs had greater antibacterial activity against actinomyces spp. than streptococcus spp. ua and oa at 1/4 mic can reduce bacterial biofilm formation, whereas higher ua concentrations displayed antibacterial activity against actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans in mature biofilms. for instance, 2.0 mg ml(-1) ua was sufficient to kill an a. viscosus biofilm. conclusions: ua and oa inhibit the growth of cariogenic microorganisms, which suggests that ua and oa have considerable potential as antibacterial agents for dental caries prevention.

TI  == incorporation of antimicrobial agents can be used to enhance the antibacterial effect of endodontic sealers.
AB  == aim: the antibacterial activity of five endodontic sealers against three different microorganism strains alone and following incorporation of 2% benzalkonium chloride (bc) and 2% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) was evaluated. methodology: the agar diffusion method was used to determine the inhibitory effect of the following endodontic sealers: roekoseal, endomethasone n, n2, apexit plus and ah plus, on streptococcus mutans - atcc 25175, lactobacillus casei - atcc 4646 and actinomyces viscosus - atcc 19246. bacterial strains were inoculated into bhib, and incubated in an anaerobic atmosphere (37 degrees c). from the bacteria grown in the liquid medium, the density of the inoculum was set to be equivalent to mcfarland 2 standard. in shaedler agar, 350 mul of the bacterial suspension were equally spread. specimens (4 mm x 6 mm) were prepared from each material without and with addition of 2% bc or 2% cpc. the inhibition zones were determined after 2 days, after 7 days and after 21 days of incubation. results: the largest inhibition zones were shown at zero time in all cases, with  progressively less inhibition at 7 and 21 days. endomethasone n and n2 showed the most intense antimicrobial activity, while roekoseal showed the least antimicrobial effect. the most susceptible microorganism was a. viscosus. greater antimicrobial effects were found following incorporation of bc or cpc, and generally, bc gave greater inhibition zones than cpc. conclusions: adding either  bc or cpc has the potential to improve clinical outcomes with endodontic sealers, as these substances enhance the short-term antimicrobial effects of the sealers.

TI  == streptococcus mutans protein synthesis during mixed-species biofilm development by high-throughput quantitative proteomics.
AB  == biofilms formed on tooth surfaces are comprised of mixed microbiota enmeshed in an extracellular matrix. oral biofilms are constantly exposed to environmental changes, which influence the microbial composition, matrix formation and expression of virulence. streptococcus mutans and sucrose are key modulators associated with the evolution of virulent-cariogenic biofilms. in this study, we  used a high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to examine how s. mutans  produces relevant proteins that facilitate its establishment and optimal survival during mixed-species biofilms development induced by sucrose. biofilms of s. mutans, alone or mixed with actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis, were initially formed onto saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surface under carbohydrate-limiting condition. sucrose (1%, w/v) was then introduced to cause environmental changes, and to induce biofilm accumulation. multidimensional protein identification technology (mudpit) approach detected up to 60% of proteins encoded by s. mutans within biofilms. specific proteins associated with  exopolysaccharide matrix assembly, metabolic and stress adaptation processes were highly abundant as the biofilm transit from earlier to later developmental stages following sucrose introduction. our results indicate that s. mutans within a mixed-species biofilm community increases the expression of specific genes associated with glucan synthesis and remodeling (gtfbc, dexa) and glucan-binding  (gbpb) during this transition (p<0.05). furthermore, s. mutans up-regulates specific adaptation mechanisms to cope with acidic environments (f1f0-atpase system, fatty acid biosynthesis, branched chain amino acids metabolism), and molecular chaperones (groel). interestingly, the protein levels and gene expression are in general augmented when s. mutans form mixed-species biofilms (vs. single-species biofilms) demonstrating fundamental differences in the matrix assembly, survival and biofilm maintenance in the presence of other organisms. our data provide insights about how s. mutans optimizes its metabolism and adapts/survives within the mixed-species community in response to a dynamically changing environment. this reflects the intricate physiological processes linked  to expression of virulence by this bacterium within complex biofilms.

TI  == an ormosil-containing orthodontic acrylic resin with concomitant improvements in  antimicrobial and fracture toughness properties.
AB  == global increase in patients seeking orthodontic treatment creates a demand for the use of acrylic resins in removable appliances and retainers. orthodontic removable appliance wearers have a higher risk of oral infections that are caused by the formation of bacterial and fungal biofilms on the appliance surface. here, we present the synthetic route for an antibacterial and antifungal organically-modified silicate (ormosil) that has multiple methacryloloxy functionalities attached to a siloxane backbone (quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silicate, or qams). by dissolving the water-insoluble, rubbery ormosil in methyl  methacrylate, qams may be copolymerized with polymethyl methacrylate, and covalently incorporated in the pressure-processed acrylic resin. the latter demonstrated a predominantly contact-killing effect on streptococcus mutans atcc  36558 and actinomyces naselundii atcc 12104 biofilms, while inhibiting adhesion of candida albicans atcc 90028 on the acrylic surface. apart from its favorable antimicrobial activities, qams-containing acrylic resins exhibited decreased water wettability and improved toughness, without adversely affecting the flexural strength and modulus, water sorption and solubility, when compared with  qams-free acrylic resin. the covalently bound, antimicrobial orthodontic acrylic  resin with improved toughness represents advancement over other experimental antimicrobial acrylic resin formulations, in its potential to simultaneously prevent oral infections during appliance wear, and improve the fracture resistance of those appliances.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == possible variation of the human oral bacterial community after wearing removable  partial dentures by dgge.
AB  == although it is well-known that variations of the microbial community in a specific location of human body may be associated with some diseases, the developing change of the oral microbiota related to oral diseases before and after wearing the removable partial dentures (rpd) is not completely understood.  in this study, three kinds of samples (saliva, supra- and subgingival plaque, and oral mucosal surfaces) were collected from the 10-patients group at three different times: before, 1-month and 6-months after the treatment. ten healthy adults were also selected as the control group. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was applied to identify the bacterial profiles and to analyze the dynamics of the oral microbial population in the pre- and post-therapy. the anova of repeated measurement data indicated that, in the saliva and mucosal surfaces,  wearing rpds caused significant change of numbers of amplicons. as many as 607 amplicons were chosen to cut out and re-amplify by pcr. after cloning and sequencing, a total of 16 bacterial genera were identified. the health-associated genera such as streptococcus, neisseria, rothia, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, gemella, veillonella, selenomona and actinomyces tended to decrease, whereas the  disease-associated species including streptococcus mutans tended to increase. in  general, wearing rpds influenced the diversity of the bacterial species in the oral microbial ecosystem. it is noteworthy that the oral environment will be changed from the healthy status towards the disease status after the treatment.

TI  == quaternary ammonium silane-functionalized, methacrylate resin composition with antimicrobial activities and self-repair potential.
AB  == the design of antimicrobial polymers to address healthcare issues and minimize environmental problems is an important endeavor with both fundamental and practical implications. quaternary ammonium silane-functionalized methacrylate (qams) represents an example of antimicrobial macromonomers synthesized by a sol-gel chemical route; these compounds possess flexible si-o-si bonds. in present work, a partially hydrolyzed qams co-polymerized with 2,2-[4(2-hydroxy 3-methacryloxypropoxy)-phenyl]propane is introduced. this methacrylate resin was  shown to possess desirable mechanical properties with both a high degree of conversion and minimal polymerization shrinkage. the kill-on-contact microbiocidal activities of this resin were demonstrated using single-species biofilms of streptococcus mutans (atcc 36558), actinomyces naeslundii (atcc 12104) and candida albicans (atcc 90028). improved mechanical properties after hydration provided the proof-of-concept that qams-incorporated resin exhibits self-repair potential via water-induced condensation of organic modified silicate (ormosil) phases within the polymerized resin matrix.

TI  == effects of xylitol on xylitol-sensitive versus xylitol-resistant streptococcus mutans strains in a three-species in vitro biofilm.
AB  == we studied the effects of xylitol on biofilms containing xylitol-resistant (xr) and xylitol-sensitive (xs) streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and s. sanguinis. the biofilms were grown for 8 and 24 h on hydroxyapatite discs. the viable microorganisms were determined by plate culturing techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) was performed using a s. mutans-specific probe. extracellular cell-bound polysaccharides (eps) were determined by spectrofluorometry from single-species s. mutans biofilms. in the presence of 5 % xylitol, the counts of the xs s. mutans decreased tenfold in the  young (8 h) biofilm (p < 0.05) but no effect was seen in the mature (24 h) biofilm. no decrease was observed for the xr strains, and fish confirmed these results. no differences were detected in the eps production of the xs s. mutans grown with or without xylitol, nor between xr and xs s. mutans strains. thus, it  seems that xylitol did not affect the eps synthesis of the s. mutans strains. since the xr s. mutans strains, not inhibited by xylitol, showed no xylitol-induced decrease in the biofilms, we conclude that growth inhibition could be responsible for the decrease of the counts of the xs s. mutans strains in the clinically relevant young biofilms.

TI  == modeling of s mutans and a naeslundii acid production in vitro with caries incidence of low- and high-risk children.
AB  == objectives: nowadays, the extended ecological plaque hypothesis equates dental health with the occurrence of acidogenic generalists in the plaque flora and explains disease?the irreversible demineralization of the dental hard tissue?by an ecologic shift in plaque composition, favoring acidogenic and aciduric specialists, following repeated conditions of high sugar. in the present study, aspects of the extended ecological plaque hypothesis were examined in retrospect. method and materials: serving as a basis were data on (1) the caries incidence of children, classified according to their dmft as having low or high caries risk; (2) the qualitative plaque composition of the children with the prevalence of mutans streptococci and actinomyces; (3) the amounts of acid and acid tolerance,  determined by ph state titration (glucose), of representatively isolated strains  of mutans streptococci and actinomyces; (4) the extrapolation of the acid amount  to the occurrence of mutans streptococci and actinomyces in the plaque of children; and (5) the relationship between the extrapolated acid amount in plaque and caries incidence and the respective classification of the children into low and high caries risk. results: the synoptic consideration of the numbers of a naeslundii and s mutans in plaque of children, with their capacity for acid production in vitro, reflected the caries risk classification. conclusion: the analysis of the clinical, microbiologic, and in vitro findings concerning the virulence of the plaque isolates supports the extended ecological plaque hypothesis. children with low caries risk had developed one new decayed surface within 4 years; children with high caries risk developed four within the same time period.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == zoocin a and lauricidin in combination reduce streptococcus mutans growth in a multispecies biofilm.
AB  == dental caries is the most prevalent human infection. it is a multifactorial disease in which the microbial composition of dental plaque plays a major role in the development of clinical symptoms. the bacteria most often implicated in the development of caries are that group of streptococci referred to as the mutans streptococci, in particular streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. one  approach to the prevention of caries is to reduce the numbers of mutans streptococci in plaque to a level insufficient to support demineralization of the tooth. in this study, zoocin a, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, combined with lauricidin, a cell membrane active lipid, was shown over a 72 h period to selectively suppress the growth of s. mutans in a triple species biofilm. growth  of the non-target species streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus was not inhibited. in treated systems the amount of extracellular polysaccharide matrix produced was much reduced as determined by use of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. the ph of treated biofilms remained above neutral as opposed to a value of 4.3 in untreated controls. we conclude that use  of antimicrobial compounds that specifically target cariogenic bacteria should be further explored.

TI  == the exopolysaccharide matrix modulates the interaction between 3d architecture and virulence of a mixed-species oral biofilm.
AB  == virulent biofilms are responsible for a range of infections, including oral diseases. all biofilms harbor a microbial-derived extracellular-matrix. the exopolysaccharides (eps) formed on tooth-pellicle and bacterial surfaces provide  binding sites for microorganisms; eventually the accumulated eps enmeshes microbial cells. the metabolic activity of the bacteria within this matrix leads  to acidification of the milieu. we explored the mechanisms through which the streptococcus mutans-produced eps-matrix modulates the three-dimensional (3d) architecture and the population shifts during morphogenesis of biofilms on a saliva-coated-apatitic surface using a mixed-bacterial species system. concomitantly, we examined whether the matrix influences the development of ph-microenvironments within intact-biofilms using a novel 3d in situ ph-mapping technique. data reveal that the production of the eps-matrix helps to create spatial heterogeneities by forming an intricate network of exopolysaccharide-enmeshed bacterial-islets (microcolonies) through localized cell-to-matrix interactions. this complex 3d architecture creates compartmentalized acidic and eps-rich microenvironments throughout the biofilm, which triggers the dominance of pathogenic s. mutans within a mixed-species system. the establishment of a 3d-matrix and eps-enmeshed microcolonies were largely mediated by the s. mutans gtfb/gtfc genes, expression of which was enhanced in the presence of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. acidic pockets were found only in the interiors of bacterial-islets that are protected by eps, which impedes rapid neutralization by buffer (ph 7.0). as a result, regions of low ph (<5.5) were detected at specific locations along the surface of attachment. resistance to chlorhexidine was enhanced in cells within eps-microcolony complexes compared to those outside such structures within the biofilm. our results illustrate the critical interaction between matrix architecture and ph heterogeneity in the 3d environment. the formation of structured acidic-microenvironments in close proximity to the apatite-surface is  an essential factor associated with virulence in cariogenic-biofilms. these observations may have relevance beyond the mouth, as matrix is inherent to all biofilms.

TI  == pyrosequencing reveals unique microbial signatures associated with healthy and failing dental implants.
AB  == aim: although it is established that peri-implantitis is a bacterially induced disease, little is known about the bacterial profile of peri-implant communities  in health and disease. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbial signatures of the peri-implant microbiome in health and disease. materials and methods: subgingival and submucosal plaque samples were collected from forty subjects with periodontitis, peri-implantitis, periodontal and peri-implant health and analysed using 16s pyrosequencing. results: peri-implant  biofilms demonstrated significantly lower diversity than subgingival biofilms in  both health and disease, however, several species, including previously unsuspected and unknown organisms, were unique to this niche. the predominant species in peri-implant communities belonged to the genera butyrivibrio, campylobacter, eubacterium, prevotella, selenomonas, streptococcus, actinomyces,  leptotrichia, propionibacterium, peptococcus, lactococcus and treponema. peri-implant disease was associated with lower levels of prevotella and leptotrichia and higher levels of actinomyces, peptococcus, campylobacter, non-mutans streptococcus, butyrivibrio and streptococcus mutans than healthy implants. these communities also demonstrated lower levels of prevotella, non-mutans streptococcus, lactobacillus, selenomonas, leptotrichia, actinomyces and higher levels of peptococcus, mycoplasma, eubacterium, campylobacter, butyrivibrio, s. mutans and treponema when compared to periodontitis-associated biofilms. conclusion: the peri-implant microbiome differs significantly from the  periodontal community in both health and disease. peri-implantitis is a microbially heterogeneous infection with predominantly gram-negative species, and is less complex than periodontitis.

TI  == oral microbiota in swiss adolescents.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine, listerine and fluoride listerine mouthrinses on four putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of chlorhexidine (chx), listerine and fluoride listerine on putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm in the artificial mouth model. methods: a total of 24 human dentine discs were prepared. a biofilm composed of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii was cultured on the surfaces of human dentine discs in an artificial-mouth model. sucrose was supplied by computer-controlled release on a daily basis to simulate the real-life situation. three treatment reagents, chx, listerine and fluoride listerine, were supplied at a flow rate of 15 ml/h for 6 min twice a day. the dentine discs with biofilm were removed from the artificial mouth after being cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. the bacteria in the biofilm were analysed by plating on bhis agar and the colony-forming units of each species were counted. results: the total number of bacteria in the chx group was significantly lower than in the other three groups  (including control). there was no decline in the number of bacteria in the listerine group. s. mutans was reduced significantly in the chx group compared with the control group. the number and proportion of a. naeslundii in the chx group were significantly lower than in the other three groups. the proportion of  l. rhamnosus in the chx group was significantly higher than in the other three groups. conclusion: chx has the most significant effect on inhibition of the putative root-caries bacteria, with the exception of l. rhamnosus. both listerine and a combination of fluoride and listerine could not effectively reduce the numbers of bacteria in the biofilm. the effects of chx, listerine and fluoride listerine on root caries prevention need further investigation.

TI  == effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide chrysophsin-1 on oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  == dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and s. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) was investigated. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. live/dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), was used to observe and analyze s. mutans biofilms. mic and mbc results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by sem. furthermore, clsm images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against s. mutans biofilms. toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of hgfs in 5 min. our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of gel-entrapped catechins toward oral microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains almost half of the commensal bacterial population present in the human body. an increase in the number of these microorganisms may  result in systemic diseases such as infective endocarditis and aspiration pneumonia as well as oral infections. it is essential to control the total numbers of these microorganisms in order to suppress disease onset. thus, we examined the antimicrobial activity of a newly developed gel-entrapped catechin (gec) preparation against oral microorganisms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of gec was determined based on the relationship between a modified agar diffusion method and a broth microdilution method. gec inhibited the growth of the actinomyces, periodontopathic bacteria and candida strains tested, but did not inhibit the growth of the oral streptococci that are important in the normal oral flora. commercially available moisture gels containing antimicrobial components showed antimicrobial activity against all of  the tested strains. after a series of washes and after a 24-h incubation, gec retained the antimicrobial activity of the catechins. catalase prevented gec-induced growth inhibition of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans  suggesting that hydrogen peroxide may be involved in the antimicrobial activity of catechins. these results suggest that gec may be useful for controlling oral microorganism populations and reducing the accumulation of dental plaque, thereby helping to prevent periodontal disease and oral candidiasis.

TI  == influences of trans-trans farnesol, a membrane-targeting sesquiterpenoid, on streptococcus mutans physiology and survival within mixed-species oral biofilms.
AB  == trans-trans farnesol (tt-farnesol) is a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol commonly  found in propolis (a beehive product) and citrus fruits, which disrupts the ability of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) to form virulent biofilms. in this study, we investigated whether tt-farnesol affects cell-membrane function, acid production and/or acid tolerance by planktonic cells and biofilms of s. mutans ua159. furthermore, the influence of the agent on s. mutans gene expression and ability to form biofilms in the presence of other oral bacteria (streptococcus oralis (s. oralis) 35037 and actinomyces naeslundii (a. naeslundii) 12104) was also examined. in general, tt-farnesol (1 mmol x l(-1)) significantly increased the membrane proton permeability and reduced glycolytic activity of s. mutans in  the planktonic state and in biofilms (p < 0.05). moreover, topical applications of 1 mmol x l(-1) tt-farnesol twice daily (1 min exposure/treatment) reduced biomass accumulation and prevented ecological shifts towards s. mutans dominance  within mixed-species biofilms after introduction of 1% sucrose. s. oralis (a non-cariogenic organism) became the major species after treatments with tt-farnesol, whereas vehicle-treated biofilms contained mostly s. mutans (>90% of total bacterial population). however, the agent did not affect significantly the  expression of s. mutans genes involved in acidogenicity, acid tolerance or polysaccharide synthesis in the treated biofilms. our data indicate that tt-farnesol may affect the competitiveness of s. mutans in a mixed-species environment by primarily disrupting the membrane function and physiology of this  bacterium. this naturally occurring terpenoid could be a potentially useful adjunctive agent to the current anti-biofilm/anti-caries chemotherapeutic strategies.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == modeling of diffusion transport through oral biofilms with the inverse problem method.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the passive transport of macromolecules within dental biofilms. methodology: fluorescently labeled dextrans with different molecular mass (3 kd, 10 kd, 40 kd, 70 kd, 2000 kd) were used as a series of diffusion probes. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces naeslundii and fusobacterium nucleatum were used as inocula for biofilm formation. the diffusion processes of different probes through the in vitro biofilm were recorded with a confocal laser microscope. results: mathematical function of biofilm penetration  was constructed on the basis of the inverse problem method. based on this function, not only the relationship between average concentration of steady-state and molecule weights can be analyzed, but also that between penetrative time and  molecule weights. conclusion: this can be used to predict the effective concentration and the penetrative time of anti-biofilm medicines that can diffuse through oral biofilm. furthermore, an improved model for large molecule is proposed by considering the exchange time at the upper boundary of the dental biofilm.

AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == cultivable anaerobic microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == severe early childhood caries (ecc), while strongly associated with streptococcus mutans using selective detection (culture, pcr), has also been associated with a  widely diverse microbiota using molecular cloning approaches. the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota of severe ecc using anaerobic culture. the microbial composition of dental plaque from 42 severe ecc children was compared with that of 40 caries-free children. bacterial samples were cultured anaerobically on blood and acid (ph 5) agars. isolates were purified, and partial sequences for the 16s rrna gene were obtained from 5,608 isolates. sequence-based analysis of the 16s rrna isolate libraries from blood and acid agars of severe ecc and caries-free children had >90% population coverage, with greater diversity occurring in the blood isolate library. isolate sequences were compared with taxon sequences in the human oral microbiome database (homd), and 198 homd taxa were identified, including 45 previously uncultivated taxa, 29 extended homd taxa, and 45 potential novel groups. the major species associated with severe ecc included streptococcus mutans, scardovia wiggsiae, veillonella parvula, streptococcus cristatus, and actinomyces gerensceriae. s. wiggsiae was significantly associated with severe ecc children in the presence and absence of  s. mutans detection. we conclude that anaerobic culture detected as wide a diversity of species in ecc as that observed using cloning approaches. culture coupled with 16s rrna identification identified over 74 isolates for human oral taxa without previously cultivated representatives. the major caries-associated species were s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, the latter of which is a candidate as a newly recognized caries pathogen.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == development of a novel multi-triplex qpcr method for the assessment of bacterial  community structure in oral populations.
AB  == gingivitis and dental caries are two of the most predominant diseases in humans.  both conditions are easily treated with the removal of the plaque biofilm by brushing or the use of oral hygiene products. in both cases, pathogenic taxa found within the plaque biofilm are the causal agents of the disease. actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotalla intermedia have all been implicated in the development of gingivitis, while streptococcus mutans is the main organism associated with dental caries. many studies have so far focused on  the use of culture methods to detect and enumerate the pathogenic taxa within plaque samples. however, these methods are both labour intensive and biased towards culturable taxa. in the present study, a novel high-throughput multi-triplex quantitative pcr method was developed with the aim to investigate the community dynamics associated with oral communities. three triplex assays were designed targeting taxa associated with gingivitis and dental caries as well as oral health. saliva samples collected from healthy individuals were used in order to validate the newly developed method.

TI  == proteases of an early colonizer can hinder streptococcus mutans colonization in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary cariogen that produces several virulence factors that are modulated by a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) signaling system. in this study, we sought to determine if proteases produced by early dental plaque colonizers such as streptococcus gordonii interfere with the subsequent colonization of s. mutans bm71 on the existing streptococcal biofilms. we demonstrated that s. mutans bm71 colonized much less efficiently in vitro on streptococcal biofilms than on actinomyces naeslundii biofilms. several oral streptococci, relative to a. naeslundii, produced proteases that inactivated the  s. mutans csp. we further demonstrated that cell protein extracts from s. gordonii, but not from a. naeslundii, interfered with s. mutans bm71 colonization. in addition, s. mutans bm71 colonized more efficiently on the sgc protease knockout mutant of s. gordonii than on the parent biofilms. in conclusion, proteases of early colonizers can interfere with subsequent colonization by s. mutans in vitro.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == metabolomics of supragingival plaque and oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is initiated by demineralization of the tooth surface through acid  production by sugar metabolism of supragingival plaque microflora. to elucidate the sugar metabolic system, we used ce-ms to perform metabolomics of the central  carbon metabolism, the emp pathway, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and the tca cycle in supra- gingival plaque and representative oral bacteria, streptococcus and actinomyces. supragingival plaque contained all the targeted metabolites in the central carbon metabolism, except erythrose 4-phosphate in the pentose-phosphate pathway. after glucose rinse, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and pyruvate  in the emp pathway and 6-phosphogluconate, ribulose 5-phosphate, and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate in the pentose-phosphate pathway, and acetyl coa were increased. meanwhile, 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate in the emp pathway and succinate, fumarate, and malate in the tca cycle were decreased. these pathways and changes in metabolites observed in supragingival plaque were similar to the integration of metabolite profiles in streptococcus and actinomyces.

TI  == the role of bacteria in the caries process: ecological perspectives.
AB  == dental biofilms produce acids from carbohydrates that result in caries. according to the extended caries ecological hypothesis, the caries process consists of 3 reversible stages. the microflora on clinically sound enamel surfaces contains mainly non-mutans streptococci and actinomyces, in which acidification is mild and infrequent. this is compatible with equilibrium of the demineralization/remineralization balance or shifts the mineral balance toward net mineral gain (dynamic stability stage). when sugar is supplied frequently, acidification becomes moderate and frequent. this may enhance the acidogenicity and acidurance of the non-mutans bacteria adaptively. in addition, more aciduric  strains, such as 'low-ph' non-mutans streptococci, may increase selectively. these microbial acid-induced adaptation and selection processes may, over time, shift the demineralization/remineralization balance toward net mineral loss, leading to initiation/progression of dental caries (acidogenic stage). under severe and prolonged acidic conditions, more aciduric bacteria become dominant through acid-induced selection by temporary acid-impairment and acid-inhibition of growth (aciduric stage). at this stage, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli as well as aciduric strains of non-mutans streptococci, actinomyces, bifidobacteria, and yeasts may become dominant. many acidogenic and aciduric bacteria are involved in caries. environmental acidification is the main determinant of the phenotypic and genotypic changes that occur in the microflora  during caries.

TI  == potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  == effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. this was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove  calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy  output of 0.4 mj/mm(2) at 3 hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium  power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. in a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. they were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (n = 6/group) using identical settings. biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (p </= 0.0001). however, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (p </= 0.0001). the extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. to increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. this novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.

AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of a resin composite matrix with or without incorporated triclosan (0.3 wt%) on streptococcus mutans, actinomyces  viscosus and lactobacillus casei. in the quantitative assay, bacterial suspensions were filled into 20-mul cavities within temporary restorative resins. after 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h of incubation, the suspensions were removed from the restoratives and the numbers of viable bacteria were determined. bacterial suspensions incubated without restoratives served as the controls. ten replicates were carried out for each experiment. the resin composite containing triclosan demonstrated variable degrees of antibacterial activity against the microorganisms, revealing a significant inhibitory effect on s. mutans within 12  h compared to the control. the viable counts of a. viscosus significantly decreased after 24 h. a significant reduction of l. casei was observed after 48 h. the unloaded resin composite did not reveal a marked antibacterial effect. the resin composite loaded with triclosan might be beneficial in preventing cavity contamination and minimizing the risk of pulpal irritation in the short-term.

TI  == antiaggregation potential of berry fractions against pairs of streptococcus mutans with fusobacterium nucleatum or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation is an interspecies adhesion process, which is essential to the development of dental plaque. this is an in vitro study of the composition of the soluble solids in the berry juice molecular size fractions (<10 kda, fi; 10-100 kda, fii; >100 kda, fiii) derived from apple, bilberry, blackcurrant, cloudberry, crowberry and lingonberry and their ability to inhibit and reverse coaggregation  of the pairs of common species in dental plaque: streptococcus mutans with fusobacterium nucleatum or actinomyces naeslundii. inhibitory and reversal activity was found in the molecular size fractions fii and fiii of bilberry, blackcurrant, crowberry and lingonberry. the active fractions contained higher amounts of polyphenols (5-12% of soluble solids) than those without activity (<2% of soluble solids). proanthocyanidins dominated in the active lingonberry juice fractions fii and fiii and also small amounts of anthocyanins were detected. anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonol glycosides were prevalent in fii and fiii fractions of bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices. comparable amounts of sugars and titratable acids were present in the latter three berry juice fractions of different size. the results indicate that the high molecular size fractions of lingonberry, bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices have antiaggregation potential on common oral bacteria, the potential being associated with their polyphenolic content.

TI  == [establishment and evaluation of the in vitro dynamic biofilm model].
AB  == purpose: to establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. methods: the fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. four strains of oral bacteria, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. the hydroxyapatite (ha) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. the temperature, oxide pressure, ph, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. distilled water and 25mm sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. at the beginning  of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. after the growth of  bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was  inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). the organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. when the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. the ha discs and glass slides  were observed every 24 hours for five times. the data was analyzed using spss 10.0 software package. dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. results: the dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. with the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. conclsuions: the model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. the model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases modulate the establishment of microcolonies within multispecies biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a key contributor to the formation of the extracellular polysaccharide (eps) matrix in dental biofilms. the exopolysaccharides, which are mostly glucans synthesized by streptococcal glucosyltransferases (gtfs), provide  binding sites that promote accumulation of microorganisms on the tooth surface and further establishment of pathogenic biofilms. this study explored (i) the role of s. mutans gtfs in the development of the eps matrix and microcolonies in  biofilms, (ii) the influence of exopolysaccharides on formation of microcolonies, and (iii) establishment of s. mutans in a multispecies biofilm in vitro using a novel fluorescence labeling technique. our data show that the ability of s. mutans strains defective in the gtfb gene or the gtfb and gtfc genes to form microcolonies on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surfaces was markedly disrupted. however, deletion of both gtfb (associated with insoluble glucan synthesis) and gtfc (associated with insoluble and soluble glucan synthesis) is required for the maximum reduction in eps matrix and biofilm formation. s. mutans grown with sucrose in the presence of streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii steadily formed exopolysaccharides, which allowed the initial clustering of bacterial cells and further development into highly structured microcolonies. concomitantly, s. mutans became the major species in the mature biofilm. neither  the eps matrix nor microcolonies were formed in the presence of glucose in the multispecies biofilm. our data show that gtfb and gtfc are essential for establishment of the eps matrix, but gtfb appears to be responsible for formation of microcolonies by s. mutans; these gtf-mediated processes may enhance the competitiveness of s. mutans in the multispecies environment in biofilms on tooth surfaces.

TI  == [dissertations 25 years after date 21. enhancing resistance to bacteria with chlorhexidine varnish and probiotics].
AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

TI  == transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque ph decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low ph is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. the acidification also influences plaque bacteria. severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. we, therefore, investigated the effects  of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, lactobacillus paracasei, and actinomyces naeslundii were used. effects of physiological acidification at ph 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at ph 4.0-7.0, were  investigated. results: mutans streptococci and lactobacillus grew at ph 4.0 but the growth of s. sanguinis and s. oralis ceased below ph 4.2 and ph 4.2-4.4, respectively. acidification at ph 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and actinomyces, respectively. furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of s. sanguinis, s. oralis and actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental ph had returned to 7.0. the acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and lactobacillus.  conclusions: these results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.

TI  == oral biofilm models for mechanical plaque removal.
AB  == in vitro plaque removal studies require biofilm models that resemble in vivo dental plaque. here, we compare contact and non-contact removal of single and dual-species biofilms as well as of biofilms grown from human whole saliva in vitro using different biofilm models. bacteria were adhered to a salivary pellicle for 2 h or grown after adhesion for 16 h, after which, their removal was evaluated. in a contact mode, no differences were observed between the manual, rotating, or sonic brushing; and removal was on average 39%, 84%, and 95% for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundii, respectively, and 90% and 54% for the dual- and multi-species biofilms, respectively. however, in a non-contact mode, rotating and sonic brushes still removed considerable numbers of bacteria (24-40%), while the manual brush as a control (5-11%) did not. single a. naeslundii and dual-species (a. naeslundii and s. oralis) biofilms were more difficult to remove after 16 h growth than after 2  h adhesion (on average, 62% and 93% for 16- and 2-h-old biofilms, respectively),  while in contrast, biofilms grown from whole saliva were easier to remove (97% after 16 h and 54% after 2 h of growth). considering the strong adhesion of dual-species biofilms and their easier more reproducible growth compared with biofilms grown from whole saliva, dual-species biofilms of a. naeslundii and s. oralis are suggested to be preferred for use in mechanical plaque removal studies in vitro.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species.
AB  == objective: the aim was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species with and without the presence of saliva and a possible effect on the salivary proteins. methods: suspensions of actinomyces naeslundii (actcc 12104(t)), lactobacilli casei (n ctc 151) and streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), in salt buffer or in saliva, were exposed to ozone gas delivered by the ozone generator healozone 2130c. aliquots of the suspensions were taken after 10, 30 and 60s ozone exposures and cultivated on agar plates. initial number of bacteria per ml was 8.0 x 10(7) (sd 2.2 x 10(7)) (a. naeslundii), 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 3.1 x 10(6)) (l. casei) and 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 7.0 x 10(5)) (s. mutans), respectively. the proteins were separated by sds electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. results: in salt buffer 92%, 73% and 64% of the initial numbers of a. naeslundii, s. mutans and l. casei, respectively, were killed already after 10s ozone exposure, while approximately 99.9% of the bacteria were dead after a 60s exposure. after 10 and 30s, but not after 60s exposure to ozone, s. mutans and l. casei were less efficiently killed  in saliva compared to the salt buffer. various saliva proteins were degraded by ozone after a 60s exposure. conclusions: the cariogenic species s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii were almost eliminated following 60s of ozone treatment.  this killing was reduced in the presence of saliva although increasing the ozone  application time to 60s overcame these reductants in saliva. detection of altered salivary proteins indicates that saliva components constitute additional targets  for ozone.

TI  == dental caries vaccine.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. in modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by  host, agent, and environmental factors. the time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. a wide group of microorganisms are  identified from carious lesions of which s. mutans , lactobacillus acidophilus ,  and actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. in india, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. surveys among the u.s. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is  the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. these dental caries vaccines  are still in the early stages.

TI  == activity of panduratin a isolated from kaempferia pandurata roxb. against multi-species oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  == the formation of dental biofilm caused by oral bacteria on tooth surfaces is the  primary step leading to oral diseases. this study was performed to investigate the preventive and reducing effects of panduratin a, isolated from kaempferia pandurata roxb., against multi-species oral biofilms consisting of streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of panduratin a was determined by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution assay. prevention of biofilm formation was performed on 96-well microtiter plates by coating panduratin a in mucin at 0.5-40 microg/ml, followed by biofilm formation at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the reducing effect on the preformed biofilm was tested by forming the biofilm at 37 degrees c for 24 h, followed by treatment with panduratin a at 0.2-10 microg/ml for up to 60 min. panduratin a showed a mic of 1 microg/ml for multi-species strains. panduratin a at 2 x mic for 8 h exhibited bactericidal activity against multi-species planktonic cells for 8 h. at 8 x mic, panduratin a was able to prevent biofilm formation by > 50%. biofilm mass was reduced by > 50% after exposure to panduratin a at 10 microg/ml for 15 min. panduratin a showed a  dose-dependent effect in preventing and reducing the biofilm. these results suggest that panduratin a is applicable as a natural anti-biofilm agent to eliminate oral bacterial colonization during early dental plaque formation.

TI  == correlations of oral bacterial arginine and urea catabolism with caries experience.
AB  == background/aim: alkali generation by oral bacteria plays a key role in plaque ph  homeostasis and may be a major impediment to the development of dental caries. to determine if the capacity of oral samples to produce ammonia from arginine or urea was related to caries experience, the arginine deiminase system (ads) and urease activity in saliva and dental plaque samples were measured in 45 adult subjects. methods: the subjects were divided into three groups according to caries status; 13 caries-free (cf) individuals (decayed, missing, and filled teeth = 0); 21 caries-active (ca) individuals (decayed teeth >or= 4); and 11 caries-experienced (ce) individuals (decayed teeth = 0; missing and filled teeth  > 0). real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the proportion of  certain acid- or alkali-producing organisms in the samples. results: the amount of ammonia generated from the test substrates by plaque samples was generally higher than that produced by salivary samples in all groups. significantly higher levels of salivary ads activity and plaque urease activity were observed in cf subjects compared to ca subjects (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.014, respectively). the proportions of streptococcus mutans from saliva and dental plaque of ca subjects  were significantly higher than those from the cf group (p = 0.0153 and p = 0.0009, respectively). in the ca group, there was an inverse relationship between urease activity and the levels of s. mutans (p < 0.0001). conclusion: this study  supports the theory that increased caries risk is associated with reduced alkali-generating capacity of the bacteria colonizing the oral cavity; providing  compelling evidence to further our understanding of oral alkali-generation in health and disease.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific  media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not  only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance  of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

AB  == introduction: galla chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of galla chinensis and its chemical fractions. methods: a four-organism bacterial consortium (streptococcus sanguis,  streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown  on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. galla chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed  into different flow cells. the ph value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the ha discs were counted. enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. the biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. results: when galla chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase ph remained higher than that  in the sucrose alone. a lower level of colonization on the ha surface was also observed in the groups to which galla chinensis and fluoride were added compared  with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less  compact biofilm, respectively. enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the galla chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. conclusions: galla chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. galla chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents  that may prevent dental caries.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI  == influence of a chitosan on oral bacterial adhesion and growth in vitro.
AB  == generally, mechanical plaque control without chemical support is insufficient to  prevent oral diseases, and an ongoing quest exists for new antimicrobials for use in oral healthcare. chitosans are polycationic, naturally occurring antimicrobials that are rapidly finding their way into oral healthcare. in this study we determined the effects of pellicle treatment with chitosan on bacterial  adhesion and growth. chitosan caused a reduction in bacterial adhesion and was responsible for bacterial death upon contact compared with a buffer control. exposure of adhering bacteria to a chitosan solution or a buffer control did not  cause detachment, but the chitosan solution left a small proportion of the adhering bacteria alive. growth after exposure to chitosan was similar to (streptococcus mutans atcc700610, streptococcus oralis hm1, streptococcus sobrinus hg1025) or less than (s. mutans ns, actinomyces naeslundii hm1) that of  the control, while biofilm viability after chitosan treatment was lower than that of the control, except for s. oralis hm1. therefore, chitosan is a promising antimicrobial for use in oral healthcare.

TI  == effect of starch and sucrose on dental biofilm formation and on root dentine demineralization.
AB  == the cariogenicity of starch alone or in combination with sucrose is controversial and the effect on dentine demineralization and on the dental biofilm formed has not been explored under controlled conditions. a crossover, single-blind study was conducted in four steps of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal appliance containing 10 slabs of root dentine to which the following treatments were applied extraorally: 2% starch gel-like solution (starch group);  10% sucrose solution (sucrose group); a solution containing 2% starch and 10% sucrose (starch + sucrose group), or 2% starch solution followed by 10% sucrose solution (starch --> sucrose group). on the 14th day of each phase the biofilms were collected for biochemical and microbiological analyses, and dentine demineralization was assessed by hardness. a higher demineralization was found in dentine exposed to sucrose and starch sucrose combinations than to starch alone (p < 0.01), but the sucrose-containing groups did not differ significantly from each other (p > 0.05). the concentrations of soluble and insoluble extracellular  polysaccharides (eps), and the proportion of insoluble eps, were lower in the biofilm formed in presence of starch (p < 0.01) than in those formed in the presence of sucrose or sucrose/starch combinations; however, no significant difference was observed among the groups containing sucrose (p > 0.05). rna was successfully isolated and purified from in situ biofilms and only biofilms formed in response to sucrose and starch/sucrose combinations showed detectable levels of gtfb and gtfc mrna. the findings suggest that the combination of starch with sucrose may not be more cariogenic to dentine than sucrose alone.

AB  == hydroxychavicol isolated from the chloroform extraction of aqueous extract of piper betle leaves showed inhibitory activity against oral cavity pathogens. it exhibited an inhibitory effect on all of the oral cavity pathogens tested (mics of 62.5 to 500 microg/ml) with a minimal bactericidal concentration that was twofold greater than the inhibitory concentration. hydroxychavicol exhibited concentration-dependent killing of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 up to 4x mic and also prevented the formation of water-insoluble glucan. interestingly, hydroxychavicol exhibited an extended postantibiotic effect of 6 to 7 h and prevented the emergence of mutants of s. mutans atcc 25175 and actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987 at 2x mic. furthermore, it also inhibited the growth of biofilms generated by s. mutans and a. viscosus and reduced the preformed biofilms by these bacteria. increased uptake of propidium iodide by hydroxychavicol-treated cells of s. mutans and a. viscosus indicated that hydroxychavicol probably works through the disruption of the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures. hydroxychavicol also exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. this was evident from its concentration-dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation and significant suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in human neutrophils. its efficacy against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose suggests that hydroxychavicol would be a useful compound for  the development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and that it has great potential for use in mouthwash for preventing and treating oral infections.

TI  == antimicrobial effectiveness of an herbal mouthrinse compared with an essential oil and a chlorhexidine mouthrinse.
AB  == background: the authors investigated mouthrinses' antimicrobial effectiveness against predominant oral bacteria, as determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). specifically, they evaluated an herbal mouthrinse, an essential oil rinse and a 0.12 percent chlorhexidine gluconate rinse. methods: the authors assessed the inhibitory effects of the three test agents against 40 oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 micrograms per millliter. they inoculated plates containing basal medium and the  test agents with suspensions of the test species and incubated them anaerobically at 35 degrees c. the authors interpreted the mic as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: the  herbal mouthrinse inhibited the growth of most of the 40 test species. compared with the essential oil mouthrinse, the herbal mouthrinse exhibited significantly  lower mics for actinomyces species, periodontal pathogens eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia and prevotella species, as well as the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans. the chlorhexidine gluconate rinse had the lowest mics compared with the essential oil rinse and the herbal rinse for all test species examined. conclusions: although less potent than the chlorhexidine gluconate rinse, the herbal rinse was more effective than the essential oil rinse in inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria in vitro. clinical implications: the data  suggest that the herbal mouthrinse may provide oral health benefits by inhibiting the growth of periodontal and cariogenic pathogens. in vivo clinical testing is essential to confirm in vitro results.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == bacteria of dental caries in primary and permanent teeth in children and young adults.
AB  == although streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a major etiological agent of dental caries, our cross-sectional preliminary study indicated that 10% of subjects with rampant caries in permanent teeth do not have detectable levels of  s. mutans. our aims were to use molecular methods to detect all bacterial species associated with caries in primary and permanent teeth and to determine the bacterial profiles associated with different disease states. plaque was collected from 39 healthy controls and from intact enamel and white-spot lesions, dentin lesions, and deep-dentin lesions in each of 51 subjects with severe caries. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identities. in a reverse-capture checkerboard assay, 243 samples were analyzed for 110 prevalent bacterial species. a sequencing analysis of 1,285 16s rrna clones detected 197 bacterial species/phylotypes, of which 50% were not cultivable. twenty-two new phylotypes were identified. proc mixed tests revealed  health- and disease-associated species. in subjects with s. mutans, additional species, e.g., species of the genera atopobium, propionibacterium, and lactobacillus, were present at significantly higher levels than those of s. mutans. lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium dentium, and low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in subjects with no detectable s. mutans. actinomyces spp. and non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in white-spot lesions, while known acid producers were found at their highest levels later in disease. bacterial profiles change with disease states and differ between primary and secondary dentitions. bacterial species other than s. mutans, e.g., species of the genera veillonella, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and propionibacterium, low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp., and atopobium spp., likely play important roles in caries progression.

TI  == bacterial composition and red fluorescence of plaque in relation to primary and secondary caries next to composite: an in situ study.
AB  == background/hypothesis: secondary caries has been suggested as the main reason for restoration replacement. we hypothesized that more caries-associated bacteria are found on composite resin restoration material, compared to sound tooth tissue. methods: both restored and unrestored dentin and enamel samples were placed in a  full denture of eight subjects for 20 weeks. the microbiological composition of approximal plaque and the association between caries-associated bacteria and red  autofluorescence of dental plaque was studied. every 4 weeks the specimens were microradiographed using transversal wavelength independent microradiography (t-wim). after 1 and 20 weeks red fluorescence pictures and plaque samples were taken. samples were cultured for total anaerobic counts, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, candida and actinomyces odontolyticus. results: lesion depth in the dentin and enamel was positively associated with lactobacilli, and lesion depth in dentin was positively associated with a. odontolyticus, whereas no association was found between mutans streptococci and lesion depth. the red-fluorescent bacteria a. odontolyticus and lactobacilli did not correlate with red-fluorescent plaque, indicating that red fluorescence is probably not caused by a single species of these bacteria. after 20 weeks, a higher proportion of combined mutans streptococci and lactobacilli was found on restored tissue compared to non-restored tissue (p = 0.04). conclusion: the higher proportion of caries-associated bacteria on restored tissue indicates that the ecology on the surface of primary lesions differs from that on lesions next to composite, and that secondary caries next to composite may differ from the primary caries process.

TI  == effects of amine fluoride on biofilm growth and salivary pellicles.
AB  == the amine fluoride (amf) n'-octadecyl-trimethylene-diamine-n,n,n'-tris(2-ethanol)-dihydro-fluoride is a cationic antimicrobial which can have beneficial effects on plaque formation. here, we determine changes in pellicle and bacterial cell surface properties of the strains actinomyces naeslundii hm1, streptococcus mutans ns, s.mutans atcc 700610, s. sobrinus hg1025 and s. oralis hm1 upon adsorption of this amf and accompanying effects on bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth. in vitro pellicles had a zeta potential of -12 mv that became less negative upon adsorption of amf.  the chemical functionalities in which carbon and oxygen were involved changed after amf adsorption and amf-treated pellicles had a greater surface roughness than untreated pellicles. water contact angles in vitro decreased from 56 to 45 degrees upon amf treatment, which corresponded with water contact angles (44 degrees ) measured intraorally on the front incisors of volunteers immediately after using an amf-containing toothpaste. all bacterial strains were negatively charged and their isoelectric points (iep) increased upon amf adsorption. minimal inhibitory concentrations were smallest for strains exhibiting the largest increase in iep. adhesion to salivary pellicles and biofilm growth of the mutans  streptococcal strains were significantly reduced after amf treatment, but not of  a. naeslundii or s. oralis. however, regardless of the strain involved, biofilm viability decreased significantly after amf treatment. the electrostatic interaction between cationic amf and negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces is pivotal in establishing reduced biofilm formation by amf through a combination of effects on initial adhesion and killing. the major effect of amf treatment, however, was a reduction brought about in biofilm viability.

TI  == in vitro anti-biofilm activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans houtt. against oral primary colonizer bacteria.
AB  == in early dental plaque formation, oral primary colonizers such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus are initially attached to  the pellicle-coated tooth surface to form a biofilm. the study aimed to determine the efficacy of macelignan, isolated from nutmeg (myristica fragrans houtt.), in  removing each single oral primary biofilm in vitro on a polystyrene 96-well microtiter plate. four biofilm growth phases (4, 12, 20 and 24 h) were evaluated  in this study after treatment with macelignan at various concentrations (0.2, 2 and 10 microg/ml) and exposure times (5, 10 and 30 min). anti-biofilm activity of macelignan was measured as the percentage of the remaining biofilm absorbance after macelignan treatment in comparison with the untreated control. at 24 h of biofilm growth, s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. sanguis biofilms were reduced by up to 30%, 30% and 38%, respectively, after treatment with 10 microg/ml macelignan for 5 min. increasing the treatment time to 30 min resulted in a reduction of more than 50% of each of the single primary biofilms. the results indicate that macelignan is a potent natural anti-biofilm agent against oral primary colonizers.

TI  == surface antibacterial properties of glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  == background: atraumatic restorative treatment (art) is recommended for use worldwide, not only in developing countries where resources are not readily available, but also in more industrialized countries. the antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials may improve the restorative treatment  outcome. glass ionomer cement (gic) has been advocated as the preferred restoration material for art. the authors evaluated the antibacterial properties  of restorative materials-three gics and a zinc oxide eugenol (zoe)-in vitro. methods: streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and enterococcus faecalis were the test microorganisms. the authors used a quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assay to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the restorative  materials using the direct contact test (dct) of freshly prepared and one-week-aged materials. results: the freshly prepared gics and zoe showed no bacterial growth in all tested bacteria compared with a control. this effect lasted for at least one week for s. mutans and a. viscosus but not for e. faecalis. conclusions: conventional gics used in art showed antibacterial surface properties against cariogenic bacteria for at least one week. further study on the long-term antimicrobial effects of gics is needed. clinical implications: the antimicrobial properties of freshly prepared restorative materials and aged restorative materials used in art have a potent effect against cariogenic bacteria. these properties have crucial importance in preventing secondary caries.

TI  == activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. to address this problem, we have examined  the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. we demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mpe), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and candida species found in oral infections. since streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against s. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. our results indicate that mpe can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. incubation with 5 nm mpe prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nm mpe reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. structure-function analyses suggest that mpe inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds dna at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act  both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular  antibiotic, similar to other amps. we conclude that mpe and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.

AB  == the prevalence of root-surface caries is increasing. we hypothesized that some restorative materials are protective against cariogenic challenge on root surfaces. our goal was to study the effects of different restorative materials on root surfaces incubated with an oral biofilm generated in an artificial mouth. a  biofilm of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and actinomyces naeslundii was co-cultured for 21 days on 24 glass-ionomer cement, resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, or resin-composite-restored root surfaces. these surfaces were then examined with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron energy-dispersive spectroscopy. only glass-ionomer restorations showed a significant increase in log calcium-to-phosphorus ratio (p < 0.01), and a significantly lower log amide i-to-hydrogen phosphate ratio on the root surface after incubation in the artificial mouth. glass-ionomer restoratives conferred a preventive effect on the root surfaces against initial cariogenic challenge with a mixed-species oral biofilm without therapeutic intervention.

TI  == the effects of polishing methods on surface morphology, roughness and bacterial colonisation of titanium abutments.
AB  == bacterial colonisation of exposed implant and abutment surfaces can lead to peri-implantitis, a common cause of oral implant failure. when an abutment becomes exposed in the oral environment the typical recommendation is to debride  it, to obtain a smoother surface which might be expected to reduce bacterial colonisation. the aim of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, a conventional polishing protocol (pp1) and a simplified polishing protocol (pp2), suggested to  have advantages over pp1. the surface morphology and roughness of titanium abutments were characterised at each stage of polishing, and adhesion of oral bacteria was evaluated, using atomic force microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. pp1 and pp2 methodologies resulted  in indistinguishable surface finishes, with fewer scratches than the unmodified surface, and equal roughness values. pp2 resulted in less disruption and less removal of surface material. early biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans was  reduced on surfaces polished using pp2, but not pp1. biofilms of actinomyces naeslundii were more extensive on polished abutment surfaces. simplified protocol pp2 may be preferable to conventional protocol pp1, since less material is removed, and there is less chance of rough areas remaining. polishing, however, does not necessarily reduce oral bacterial colonisation.

TI  == effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  == dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. recent literature has demonstrated that infrared co(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. in this study, a xecl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (summit technology, boston, usa). both aerobe (streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii) and  anaerobe microorganisms (a. odontolyticus, prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. according to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 j/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 hz were used for all irradiations. colony-forming units  after laser irradiation were counted. excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. as compared to s. mutans and s. sanguis, a. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both  aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. new studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other  wavelengths or conventional therapies.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == incipient caries lesions on cementum by mono- and co-culture oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: there is increasing prevalence of root caries. we hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. this study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces israelii. sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. materials and methods: the matrix (amide i) and phosphate content  of the lesions was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (sem-edx). results: the log[amide i:hpo(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that a. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[ca:p] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. conclusions: oral biofilm arising  from bacterial species a. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested  and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.

TI  == multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  == clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. the crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. comparable numbers of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, neisseria subflava, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. quantitative  fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene  formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (eps) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific  fluorescent stains. anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm eps and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (p < 0.05). sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm eps in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (p < 0.05). clsm demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm eps, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (p < 0.05). agents in oral hygiene formulations  (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (n-acetyl-l-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (p < 0.05). multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm eps and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as  a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.

TI  == association between the presence of bacterial 16s rna in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (sweden).
AB  == objective: to study bacterial 16s rna in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial dna was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n =  171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). methods: 16s dna pcr followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. results: in 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16s rna were detected.  sequence analysis revealed propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16s rna positive patients). the second most frequent isolate-escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. the other isolates included pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == an in vitro quantitative antibacterial analysis of amalgam and composite resins.
AB  == objectives: antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials such as amalgam and composite resins may improve the restorative treatment outcome. this  study evaluates the antibacterial properties of three composite resins: z250, tetric ceram, p60 and a dental amalgam in vitro. methods: streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus served as test microorganisms. three quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assays were used to evaluate the effect of the restorative materials on: (i) early-stage biofilm using a direct contact test (dct); (ii) planktonic bacterial growth; (iii) bacterial growth in the materials' elute. for comparison purposes, agar diffusion test (adt) was also performed. results: the effect of the composite resins on bacterial growth was minimal and limited to a few days only. one-week-aged composites promoted growth of s. mutans and a. viscosus. the antibacterial properties in direct contact were more potent  than in planktonic bacterial growth. amalgam showed complete inhibition of both bacteria in all phases, and the effect lasted for at least 1 week. the materials' elute had no effect on both bacterial growth with the exception of complete inhibition of s. mutans in amalgam. the later results correlated with the adt. conclusions: the present findings demonstrate potent and lasting antibacterial properties of amalgam, which are lacking in composite resins. this may explain the clinical observation of biofilm accumulated more on composites compared to amalgams. it follows that the assessment of antibacterial properties of poorly-soluble materials has to employ more than one assay.

TI  == host-derived pentapeptide affecting adhesion, proliferation, and local ph in biofilm communities composed of streptococcus and actinomyces species.
AB  == salivary proline-rich proteins (prps) attach commensal actinomyces and streptococcus species to teeth. here, gel filtration, mass spectrometry and edman degradation were applied to show the release of a pentapeptide, rgrpq, from prp-1 upon proteolysis by streptococcus gordonii. moreover, synthetic rgrpq and derivatives were used to investigate associated innate properties and responsible motifs. the rgrpq peptide increased 2.5-fold the growth rate of s. gordonii via a q-dependent sequence motif and selectively stimulated oral colonization of this organism in a rat model in vivo. in contrast, the growth of streptococcus mutans, implicated in caries, was not affected. while the entire rgrpq sequence was required to block sucrose-induced ph-decrease by s. gordonii and s. mutans, the n-terminal arg residue mediated the ph increase (i.e., ammonia production) by s.  gordonii alone (which exhibits arg catabolism to ammonia). strains of commensal viridans streptococci exhibited prp degradation and arg catabolism, whereas cariogenic species did not. the rgrpq peptide mediated via a differential q-dependent sequence motif, adhesion inhibition, and desorption of prp-1-binding  strains of a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (5 of 10 strains) but not of s. gordonii (n=5). the inhibitable a. naeslundii strains alone displayed the same binding profile as s. gordonii to hybrid peptides terminating in rgrpq or gqspq, derived  from the middle or c-terminal segments of prp-1. the present findings indicate the presence of a host-bacterium interaction in which a host peptide released by  bacterial proteolysis affects key properties in biofilm formation.

AB  == colonization of candida albicans on oral surfaces can serve as a reservoir for disseminated infections, such as aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal infection, particularly in the immunocompromised host. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salivary and serum pellicles on c. albicans, streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, lactobacillus and actinomyces colonization on type i collagen, a major organic component of periodontal ligaments. the colonization potential of two isolates each of c. albicans, s. mutans and s. sanguis, and a single isolate each of lactobacillus and actinomyces to uncoated (control), saliva-coated or serum-coated type i collagen plates (surface area 143 mm(2), cell disk; sumitomo, tokyo, japan) was examined using a  bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate assay based on firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the results revealed that with mutans streptococci, a saliva pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting bacterial colonization compared with the pellicle-free collagen disc, and the serum-coated sample significantly inhibited the colonization of streptococci (anova; p < 0b01). in contrast, in the case of c. albicans, lactobacillus and actinomyces isolates, a serum pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting the colonization, followed by saliva pellicle and uncoated specimen (anova; p < 0b01). these results suggested that crevicular fluid rich in seruminous components would promote the colonization of  candida, lactobacillus and actinomyces on type i collagen as opposed to streptococci which showed greater avidity to saliva-coated collagen.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == effects of nidus vespae extract and chemical fractions on the growth and acidogenicity of oral microorganisms.
AB  == nidus vespae is the honeycomb of polistes olivaceous (de geer), p. japonicus saussure, and parapolybiavaria fabricius. it is known to have a number of pharmacological effects, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-virus,  anti-tumor and anesthetic properties. the present study evaluated the antimicrobial activity and acid inhibition properties of extracts and chemical fractions of nidus vespae. the raw material was first extracted using 95% ethanol/water. subsequent fractions were prepared from this extract using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, and chloroform/methanol. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined using the microdilution method. the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) fraction showed the highest antibacterial activities with a mic of 8-16mg/ml and  an mbc of 16-32mg/ml. in addition, the extract and chemical fractions of nidus vespae showed a remarkable capacity for inhibiting the acid production of common  oral bacteria at sub-mic concentrations. sub-mic levels of the petroleum ether/ethyl acetate fraction significantly inhibited acid production by streptococcus mutans atcc 25175. the significant antiacidogenic activity demonstrated by nidus vespae shows it to be a promising source of novel anticariogenic agents.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the influence of glucosyltransferase-gene-negative (gtf-) streptococcus mutans strains unable to synthesize water-insoluble or soluble glucan on the structure and macromolecular  diffusion properties of in vitro grown mixed oral biofilms. biofilms modeling supragingival plaque consisted of actinomyces naeslundii omz 745, candida albicans omz 110, fusobacterium nucleatum kp-f2, streptococcus oralis sk 248, veillonella dispar atcc 17748t and one of the s. mutans strains ua159, omz 966, omz 937 or omz 977. biofilms were grown anaerobically on sintered hydroxyapatite  disks for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c. to perform confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses, microorganisms were stained with syto 13 and extracellular polysaccharides (eps) with calcofluor. macromolecular diffusion properties were measured following timed biofilm exposure to texas-red-labeled 70-kda dextran. results showed that replacing wild-type s. mutans by a gtfc- mutant led to an increase in the volume fraction occupied by cells from 29 to 48% and a decrease of the eps volume fraction from 51 to 33%. no such changes were observed when the s. mutans wild-type strain was replaced by a gtfb- or gtfd- mutant. the diffusion coefficient of 70-kda dextran in biofilms containing the gtfc- s. mutans was 16-fold higher than in biofilms with the wild-type strain indicating a strong macromolecular sieving effect of gtf c-generated glucans. our data demonstrate the influence of eps on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of  an oral biofilm model and uncover our still limited knowledge of the function of  eps in biofilms and plaque.

TI  == [study of antibacterial effect of galla chinensis on the bacteria biofilm in chemostat].
AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect of galla chinensis with that of chlorhexidine by means of chemostat and provide experimental foundation for caries prevention with chinese medicine instead of chemicals in future. method: a multispecies consortium biofilm (bf) model was construted in the chemostat. the growth-inhibition on bacterial biofilm coated on ha was investigated by means of  the colony-forming units (cfu). acid-inhibition was inspected by continual ph-recording in the flow cells. and the profile on the biofilm treated by both experimental medicines was observed with the scanning electromicroscopy (sem). result: both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the growth of the bf bacteria. and galla chinensis had no obvious influence on the ecological composing of the bf bacteria. both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the acid producion of experimental bacteria. but the final ph of galla chinensis  was lower than that of chlorhexidine. a typical biofilm formed on ha was observed by sem. both of galla chinensis and chlorhexidine could inhibit the production of extracellular matrix and make the bf profile on the surface of the ha clearer and simpler. conclusion: galla chinensis had definite antibacterial effect. no obvious difference is found between galla chinensis (4 g x l(-1)) and chlorhexidine (0.5 g x l(-1)). therefore, it is possible for chinese medicine to  gradually replace the chemical medicine in clinic and it will give a new choice for caries prevention.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and galla  chinesis in bioflim model. to evaluate the feasibility of application of gala chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. in the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. after a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the ha disc was  examed, the planktonic ph in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the ha disc was observed by sem. results: (1) galla chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) galla chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic ph in the flow cell, but galla chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) the biofilms formed after application of galla chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. conclusion: galla chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.

TI  == microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

AB  == this study evaluated the antibacterial activity of the glass-ionomer cements vitrebond (3m espe), ketac molar (3m espe) and fuji ix (gc america) against s mutans, s sobrinus, l acidophilus and a viscosus, using the agar diffusion test.  inocula were obtained by the seed of indicators cultures in bhi broth incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. base layers containing 15 ml of bhi agar and 300 microl of each bacteria suspension were prepared in petri dishes. six wells measuring 4 mm in diameter were made in each plate and completely filled with one of the testing materials. a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution applied in round filter papers was used as control. tests were performed 12 times for each material and bacteria strain. after incubation of the plates at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, the zones of bacterial growth inhibition around the wells were measured. overall, the results showed the following sequence of antibacterial activity: vitrebond (despite the activation mode) > 0.2% chlorhexidine > ketac molar > fuji ix, according to kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney statistical tests. this study confirmed significant antibacterial activity for two conventional glass-ionomers  and one resin-modified glass-ionomer material. the resin-modified glass-ionomer cement vitrebond, regardless of the activation mode, presented the best antibacterial activity against s mutans and s sobrinus. the antibacterial activity against a viscosus for vitrebond was similar to 0.2% chlorhexidine, while light activation reduced its antibacterial activity against l acidophilus.

TI  == antibacterial effects and physical properties of glass-ionomer cements containing chlorhexidine for the art approach.
AB  == objectives: since atraumatic restorative treatment (art) involves removal of carious lesions with manual instruments, improvement of filling materials to guarantee greater success should be considered. this study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, physical, and bonding properties of glass-ionomer cements (gic) containing chlorhexidine (chx), and to determine optimal concentrations for incorporation of agents to obtain antibacterial gics for use with the art approach. methods: chx diacetate combined with chx dihydrochloride was added to control gic powder to obtain concentration ratios of 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 1/1, or 2/2%  w/w. antibacterial activity of each cement against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei or actinomyces naeslundii was examined using agar-diffusion methods, and release of chx was analyzed by hplc. compressive strength, bond strength to dentin, and setting time were measured, and compared with those of control samples. results: all experimental gics exhibited inhibition of three bacteria, but sizes of inhibition zones and concentrations of chx released were not dependent upon chx content. incorporation of chx diacetate at 2% or greater,  significantly decreased compressive strength, and bond strength to dentin was adversely affected by addition of chx diacetate at 2% or more (p<0.05, anova, fisher's plsd test), although setting time was extended a little by addition of any concentrations of chx. significance: the present results demonstrate that experimental gics containing chx are effective in inhibiting bacteria associated  with caries, and incorporation of 1% chx diacetate is optimal to give appropriate physical and bonding properties.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of clearfil protect bond.
AB  == objectives: this study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of a commercially available self-etching adhesive system, clearfil  protect bond, which contains antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb). methods: inhibitory effects against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, or actinomyces naeslundii were examined by an agar-disc diffusion method using the clearfil protect bond primer  containing 5% mdpb and an acidic adhesion-promoting monomer mdp, the primer only  with mdp, and the primer with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (mic/mbc) of each primer for the three bacterial species were determined by serial microdilution assays. for testing the bactericidal effects seen in dentin, the primer was applied to demineralized dentin blocks in which s. mutans had been impregnated, and numbers of viable bacteria were counted. results: for all three bacteria, the sizes of the inhibition zones produced by clearfil protect bond primer were significantly greater than for the other primers (p<0.05, anova and scheffe's f-test). the mic/mbc values of clearfil protect bond primer were less than those of the primer without mdpb, and comparable to those of the primer containing cetylpyridinium chloride. no bacterial recovery was obtained after application of clearfil protect bond primer to the bacteria-impregnated dentin, although the primer without mdpb showed some bactericidal effect. significance: clearfil protect bond primer has strong antibacterial activity based upon mdpb against s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii, and the capability to disinfect cavities containing residual bacteria.

TI  == the complex oral microflora of high-risk individuals and groups and its role in the caries process.
AB  == the involvement of the oral biofilm in the caries process requires re-evaluation. the essential role of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) in the caries process is not proven. acid production by dental plaque is not dependent upon the presence of mutans streptococci; caries occurs in the absence of these species and their presence does not necessarily indicate caries  activity. other oral bacteria, non-mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp. and bifidobacterium spp., are acidogenic and aciduric. they outnumber mutans streptococci in dental plaque, and there are data which support a role for these  bacteria in the initiation and progression of caries. molecular studies demonstrate the great diversity and complexity of the flora associated with caries. many taxa identified have not been cultured and the role of these taxa is not known. we have, in mutans streptococci, good markers of disease but not necessarily the aetiological agents of the disease. considerably more research is required to investigate the transition of tooth surfaces from being intact and sound to the white spot lesion stage. a combination of conventional and molecular approaches are required to elucidate the involvement of an individual taxon and of microbial populations with particular traits in the caries process.

TI  == salivary actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  == background: gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. methods: to test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also  associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. the study population consisted of 297 predominantly african- american women who were pregnant for the first time. the salivary bacterial levels evaluated were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. results: for 1 unit increase in log(10) a. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; se = 29.1; p = 0.04), and a 0.17  week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; se = 0.09; p = 0.05). in contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) l. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; se = 19.3; p = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; se = 0.06; p = 0.04). conclusions: we conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. these organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.

TI  == antibody response to actinomyces antigen and dental caries experience: implications for caries susceptibility.
AB  == fluoridated dentifrices reduce dental caries in subjects who perform effective oral hygiene. actinomyces naeslundii increases in teeth-adherent microbial biofilms (plaques) in these subjects, and a well-characterized serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody response (actinomyces antibody [a-ab]) is also increased. other studies suggest that a serum igg antibody response to streptococcal d-alanyl poly(glycerophosphate) (s-ab) may indicate caries experience associated strongly with gingival health and exposure to fluoridated water. the aim of this study was to investigate relationships between a-ab response, oral hygiene, s-ab response, and caries experience. measurements were made of a-ab and s-ab concentrations, caries experience (number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth [dmft], number of teeth surfaces [dmfs], and number of  decayed teeth needing treated [dt]), exposure to fluoridated water (flu), mean clinical pocket depth (pd; in millimeters), and extent of plaque (pl) and gingival bleeding on probing (bop). a-ab concentration, the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis, increased with s-ab concentration and decreased with pl and dmft adjusted for flu (r(2) = 0.51, p < 0.002). residual associations with age, dmfs, dt, and bop were not significant. in addition, an elevated a-ab response, defined from immunoprecipitation and immunoassay measurements, indicated a significant, 30% reduction in dmft after adjustment for significant age and flu covariance (analysis of variance with covariance f statistic = 10.6,  p < 0.003; s-ab response and interactions not significant). thus, an elevated a-ab response indicates less caries in subjects performing effective oral hygiene using fluoridated dentifrices. conversely, a low a-ab response is suggestive of decreased a. naeslundii binding to saliva-coated apatite and greater caries experience, as reported by others.

AB  == noninvasive in situ detection of suspected cariogenic bacterial species within dental biofilms could facilitate monitoring of the dynamic change of oral microbial flora and assist in the assessment of the treatment efficacy of therapeutic agents. in this study, we explore the possibility to use three well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and lactobacillus casei to identify these three important members of the oral microbial community in the complex environment of oral biofilms. these mabs, which were conjugated to different fluorescent labels and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), proved to be an useful tool to identify the three species of interest (s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l.  casei) under various experimental conditions including in vitro and in vivo derived oral biofilms. manifold addition of the mabs on consecutive days did not  alter the biofilm structure thus allowing monitoring of the same biofilm over extended time periods. using this mab-based method the effect of sucrose challenge on the biofilm composition and the distribution of s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l. casei were examined. s. mutans was found to be the predominant species under the various biofilm conditions tested. these studies indicate that  mabs based bacterial detection with clsm is a versatile tool which permits new insights into the ecology of oral biofilm development.

AB  == objectives: to assess the antimicrobial effect of acid etching or a triclosan-containing compomer on the cultivable microflora of incompletely excavated dentinal carious lesions. methods: thirty detinal lesions were opened with a diamond burr. subsequent to removal of the softened biomass a sample of dentin was taken from the cavity floor with a round bur. ten cavities each were treated with 36% phosphoric acid (ph) for 15s, covered with a triclosan-containing compomer (tc) or received no treatment as control (co). all  lesions were restored with a compomer composite. sampling was performed directly  after etching in the ph group and at re-entry after 6 weeks in all groups. aliquots were plated on blood agar and selective media for lactobacilli (rogosa)  and mutans streptococci (msb). cultures were incubated anaerobically for 7 days at 37 degrees c prior to quantitative assessment and biotyping of the isolates. results: application of phosphoric acid resulted in initial reduction of the totally cultivable microflora (p=0.006). evaluation of the total number of cultivable microflora after 6 weeks revealed no differences between the groups (p>0.05). lactobacilli counts were significantly lower in the tc group compared to the ph and co groups (p<0.05). no difference was detected between the ph and co groups after 6 weeks. significance: phosphoric acid initially reduces the number of microorganisms in carious dentin but not in the longer term. the experimental triclosan composite suppresses lactobacilli species over a period of 6 weeks.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

TI  == fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  == salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. in this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis), and oral actinomyces. fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. group i streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group ii streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group  iii streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. each species of streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two  of these gp340 interaction groupings. the gp340 interaction modes i to iii and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. many  gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (i to iii) for s. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. adherence of s. gordonii dl1 (challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon  expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin hsa. however, aggregation of cells  by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of hsa and involved sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides. conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of s. mutans ng8 involved antigen i/ii polypeptide. deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in s. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. these results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. this phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.

AB  == dental hand instruments are not efficient in removing all infected dentin when performing carious removal for minimal intervention techniques. the use of an antibacterial dentin conditioner may therefore be useful when restoring cavities  that have residual carious dentin. antibacterial agents--chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, benzaikonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite, were added either to a dentin conditioner used for glass ionomer cements or distilled water at 1% concentration. dentin conditioning solutions at ph 2.5, 4.9 and 7.7 were also prepared, along with 1% aqueous thymol. using an agar diffusion test, 25 microl aliquots were examined for their  inhibitory effects on three cariogenic bacteria. after 24 hours, an agar pellet was extracted adjacent to the agar well and placed on a second inoculated agar plate to observe sustained inhibitory effects, after which this procedure was repeated one more time. antibacterial dentin conditioners showed significant inhibitory effect compared to the control over the three test periods (p<0.016).  the combination of dentin conditioners with antibacterial agents significantly reduced the inhibitory effect compared to the antibacterial aqueous solutions (p<0.016). one-percent aqueous thymol showed no inhibitory effect against the test bacteria. the cetrimide-dentin conditioner showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all three test bacteria over the three experimental periods (p<0.016). the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents was significantly reduced when combined with a dentin conditioner. only the cetrimide-dentin conditioner combination produced significant inhibitory effects against all three test organisms.

AB  == the antigen i/ii (agi/ii) family polypeptides, ranging from 1310 to 1653 amino acid (aa) residues, are cell wall anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous  species of oral streptococci. the polypeptides interact with a wide range of host molecules, in particular salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag or gp340), and with ligands on other oral bacteria. to determine the receptor recognition properties of six different agi/ii family polypeptides from strains of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus mutans, the genes were cloned and expressed on the surface of the surrogate host lactococcus  lactis. the s. gordonii sspa and sspb polypeptides mediated higher binding levels of l. lactis cells to surface immobilized gp340 than did s. intermedius pas protein, or s. mutans spap or pac proteins. however, the agi/ii proteins were all similar in their abilities to mediate aggregation of lactococci by fluid phase gp340. the spap(i) polypeptide from s. mutans ingbritt, which was c-terminally truncated by approximately 400 aa residues, did not bind gp340. lactococci expressing agi/ii proteins, including spap(i), were aggregated by a synthetic 16  aa residue peptide srcrp2 derived from the aa repeat block sequences within gp340. in coaggregation assays, sspb from s. gordonii was unique in mediating coaggregation with only group a and group e strains of actinomyces naeslundii. all the other agi/ii polypeptides mediated coaggregation with group c and group d strains of a. naeslundii. analysis of chimeric protein constructs revealed that coaggregation specificity was determined by sequences within the n-terminal half  of agi/ii protein. a synthetic peptide (20 aa residues), which defines a putative adhesion epitope within the c-terminal region of polypeptide, inhibited agi/ii-mediated aggregation by gp340 but did not affect coaggregation with a. naeslundii. these results suggest that different mechanisms operate in interactions of agi/ii family polypeptides with native gp340, gp340 srcr domain peptide, and a. naeslundii. specificity of these interactions appears to be determined by discontinuous but interacting regions of the polypeptides, thus providing flexibility in receptor recognition for streptococcal colonization of the human host.

TI  == effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == background: cecropin-xj belongs to cecropin-b, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. methods: four oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-xj. mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (mtt) colorimetric assay. the bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-xj were examined on scanning  electron microscope (sem). the influence of cecropin-xj on bacterial adhesion to  saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) was measured by scintillation counting. results: the mics of cecropin-xj for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/l with the highest susceptible to a. naeslundii  and the lowest susceptible to l. acidophilus. at ph 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 mic of  cecropin-xj reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for s. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for l. acidophilus. the activities against s. mutans and l. acidophilus increased at ph 5.5 compared with ph 6.8 (p  < 0.01, respectively). in present of 50% saliva, 1/2 mic of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for s. mutans and l. acidophilus, respectively (p < 0.01 and p > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria  (p > 0.05, respectively). mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj from 1.0 to 100 micromol/l exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (p > 0.05). bacterial morphological changes induced by mic of cecropin-xj examined on sem showed cell surface disruption. furthermore, the ability of a. naeslundii adhesion to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 10 and 20 minutes (p = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and s. mutans, a. viscosus to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 20 minutes (p = 0.000, respectively). conclusions: cecropin-xj exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity  enhanced in the acid environment. the results also demonstrate that cecropin-xj prevents s. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that cecropin-xj may have potential to prevent caries.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == the microflora of the erupting first permanent molar.
AB  == the relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. a significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified  as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased  numbers of streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. significantly greater numbers and proportions of s. oralis and s. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. this study suggests that  organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.

TI  == anti-bacterial efficacy of new self-etching dentine bonding agent.
AB  == since a perfect seal is not easily achieved during bonding procedures, any product which will limit or delay bacterial proliferation in the resulting micro-leakage spaces should extend the life span of bonded restorations. this study compared the antibacterial properties of an experimental, self-etching, fluoride-releasing, antibacterial bonding system (abf) with two standard bonding  systems (se bond and scotchbond mp). spread plates of three different bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus paracasei and actinomyces naeslundii) were prepared on brain-heart infusion agar. standardised, sterilised filtration paper  disks were infiltrated with 20 microl of primer and then placed on the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. the extent of the inhibition zones were measured at different positions and data were analysed using the student t-test to determine significant differences. all three primers showed zones of inhibition for all three bacteria tested. inhibition zones for abf primer against s. mutans were significantly larger (p<0.05) compared to that of scotchbond mp and se bond. in general the antibacterial activity of the three primers against the three bacteria tested varied, and the inhibitory effect for the experimental primer was significantly superior against s. mutans only.

TI  == the antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices: results of an in vitro diffusion method study.
AB  == background: increasing numbers of americans are using natural herbal products for general and oral health care. few of these products, however, have undergone rigorous testing, as evidenced by the limited amount of information on their safety and efficacy in the literature. the authors conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices. methods: the authors used a diffusion method to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of 14 natural herbal dentifrices against four microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus and candida albicans. colgate total (colgate-palmolive, new york city) and sterile pyrogen-free water served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. the authors tested the natural  herbal dentifrices at full strength and at 1:1 dilution. they measured the zones  of inhibition at 24 and 48 hours to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the dentifrices. results: six herbal dentifrices were effective in inhibiting the growth of all four microorganisms. the positive control produced significantly sized inhibition zones with all four microorganisms, while the negative control produced no observable zones. six herbal dentifrices produced larger inhibition zones with a. viscosus than did the positive control. six herbal dentifrices were inhibitory against c. albicans at full strength, but at 1:1 dilution, only three  had such inhibitory effect. one herbal dentifrice produced microbial growth around and over the samples, indicating possible microbial contamination of the toothpaste. only one herbal dentifrice showed consistent antimicrobial activity against all four microorganisms. conclusions: the variation in antimicrobial inhibition among the herbal dentifrices indicates that more research is needed to validate their effectiveness claims. clinical implications: this study provides practitioners with insight into the claims of natural herbal dentifrices' antimicrobial effects.

TI  == biofilm growth of lactobacillus species is promoted by actinomyces species and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to integrate within a biofilm is pivotal to their survival. a dependence on the amount of biofilm growth by noncoaggregating lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus plantarum on coculture with actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus mutans and veillonella parvula was investigated using an artificial-mouth culture system. biofilm formation by the lactobacilli in mono-culture was poor. in coculture with actinomyces species the amount of l. rhamnosus increased 7-20 times and l. plantarum 4-7 times compared to its mono-culture biofilm. s. mutans also promoted substantial biofilm growth of lactobacilli but v. parvula had no effect. we conclude that these actinomyces species promoted growth of key lactobacillus species in a biofilm, as did s. mutans to a smaller extent, and that the ability  of individual bacteria to form mono-culture biofilms is not necessarily an indicator of their survival and pathogenic potential in a complex multispecies biofilm community.

TI  == a simple approach to examine early oral microbial biofilm formation and the effects of treatments.
AB  == background/aims: a simple in vivo approach to examine early dental plaque formation in the human mouth and to determine the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures on biofilm formation is reported. methods: a custom designed device that fits securely behind the teeth of the mandibular arch provides a surface for microbial colonization. this device is prepared with denture acrylic and can be repeatedly used by the subject, exposing a large and constant surface area for microbial accumulation. results: large numbers of oral  bacteria colonized the device by 2 h; these increased significantly by 4 h (p < 0.05). bacterial colonization increased significantly after rinsing with a sucrose solution (p < 0.05) but remained unaffected after rinsing with water, a commercially available fluoride mouthrinse without antimicrobial agents, or brushing with a fluoride dentifrice (p > 0.05). rinsing with mouthrinses formulated with chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride or triclosan/copolymer significantly inhibited colonization (p < 0.05). a dose-dependent inhibition was  noted with chlorhexidine rinses (p < 0.05). brushing with a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited microbial colonization compared with a control (p < 0.05). conclusion: this simple approach was useful for examining the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures. significant biofilm inhibitory effects were noted with formulations that demonstrated efficacy in previous clinical studies.

TI  == suppression of caries-related microorganisms in dentine lesions after short-term  chlorhexidine or antibiotic treatment.
AB  == this study investigated the efficiency of a chlorhexidine varnish and an antibiotic paste in suppressing the cultivable microflora of deep dentine cavities in a stepwise excavation procedure. subsequent to enamel preparation and removal of the central biomass, infected dentine was sampled from the cavity floor. ten cavities each were either covered with the 1% chlorhexidine- and 1% thymol-containing varnish cervitec (ce), the demeclocycline hydrocortisone-containing ointment ledermix (le) or received no treatment as control (co). a compomer composite was used as intermediate restorative. cavities were reassessed after 6 weeks and again dentine samples were microbiologically investigated for total viable counts, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. after 6 weeks a significant reduction of the total viable counts was observed in the le group (p = 0.011) compared to the control, whereas no differences were found in the ce group (p > 0.05). mutans streptococci were rarely recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks. compared to the co group counts of lactobacilli were significantly reduced in the ce and le groups (p < 0.05). lactobacillus species were frequently recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks of observation. lactobacillus rhamnosus was the predominant species in all samples investigated.  application of ce or le resulted in reduced counts of lactobacilli after a period of 6 weeks. although none of the materials completely eliminated the viable microorganisms, the use of le was more effective than ce in reducing the total anaerobic microorganisms associated with carious dentine.

TI  == the rational design of an anti-caries peptide against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the cariogenic bacterium streptococcus mutans attaches to tooth surfaces via a cell surface adhesin termed streptococcal antigen i/ii (sa i/ii). mapping studies identified an adhesion epitope within residues 1025-1044. a synthetic peptide (p1025) spanning these residues inhibited adhesion of s. mutans in vitro and was  tested in an in vivo human streptococcal adhesion model. direct application of p1025 to the teeth prevented recolonisation of the oral cavity by s. mutans but not actinomyces naeslundii. this review also describes various other adhesion-inhibiting peptides have been identified in vitro. we suggest that adhesion-blocking synthetic peptides may provide novel anti-infective agents. topical application of such peptides at mucosal surfaces does not provide sustained selective pressure and in contrast to antibiotics, may not induce resistance.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil in vitro.
AB  == the in vitro activity of melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil against 161 isolates of oral bacteria from 15 genera was determined. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) ranged from 0.003 to 2.0% (v/v). mic90 values were 1.0% (v/v) for actinomyces spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, and 0.1% (v/v) for prevotella spp. isolates of porphyromonas, prevotella and veillonella had the lowest mics and mbcs, and isolates of streptococcus, fusobacterium and lactobacillus had the highest. time kill studies with streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that treatment with > or = 0.5% tea tree oil caused decreases in viability of >3 log colony forming units/ml after only 30 s,  and viable organisms were not detected after 5 min. these studies indicate that a range of oral bacteria are susceptible to tea tree oil, suggesting that tea tree  oil may be of use in oral healthcare products and in the maintenance of oral hygiene.

TI  == a rapid procedure to ascertain the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations.
AB  == a rapid method examining the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations with alamar blue, an oxidation-reduction dye with fluorescent end-points, is described. significant correlations between increasing viable plate counts of the oral bacteria actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and increased alamar fluorescence were noted. metabolically active bacteria reduced alamar with the reduced dye found in the cell-free filtrate. insignificant alamar reductions were noted in the absence of bacteria or by spent culture supernatants. the efficacy of mouthrinses with clinically proven antiplaque agents such as chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride were determined by alamar blue. in a model system with a. viscosus, triclosan dentifrices demonstrate a dose-dependent effect on bacteria. human salivary bacteria demonstrate increasing alamar fluorescence with increasing plate counts. a clinical study examined the effects of rinsing with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in comparison with a placebo mouthrinse and water on salivary bacteria. rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in the least  number of bacteria by alamar and plate count methods. in summary, the current study demonstrates the utility of alamar blue to examine the antimicrobial effects of oral care formulations in laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate,  clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

TI  == effect of the environment on genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis in the oral biofilm.
AB  == the genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (424 isolates) and streptococcus oralis (446 isolates) strains isolated from two sound approximal sites in all subjects who were either caries active (seven subjects) or caries free (seven subjects) was investigated by using the repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. the plaque from the caries-active subjects harbored significantly greater proportions of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and a smaller proportion of a. naeslundii organisms than the plaque sampled from the caries-free subjects. these data confirmed that the sites of the two groups of subjects were subjected to different environmental stresses, probably determined  by the prevailing or fluctuating acidic ph values. we tested the hypothesis that  the microfloras of the sites subjected to greater stresses (the plaque samples from the caries-active subjects) would exhibit reduced genotypic diversity since  the sites would be less favorable. we found that the diversity of a. naeslundii strains did not change (chi2 = 0.68; p = 0.41) although the proportional representation of a. naeslundii was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). conversely, the diversity of the s. oralis strains increased (chi2 = 11.71; p = 0.0006) and the proportional representation of s. oralis did not change. we propose that under these environmental conditions the diversity and number of niches within the oral biofilm that could be exploited by s. oralis increased, resulting in the increased genotypic diversity of this species. apparently, a. naeslundii was not  able to exploit the new niches since the prevailing conditions within the niches  may have been deleterious and not supportive of its proliferation. these results  suggest that environmental stress may modify a biofilm such that the diversity of the niches is increased and that these niches may be successfully exploited by some, but not necessarily all, members of the microbial community.

TI  == fermentation of five sucrose isomers by human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == sucrose has five structural isomers: palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, maltulose and leucrose. although these isomers have been reported to be noncariogenic disaccharides, which cannot be utilized by mutans streptococci, there is no information about their fermentability by other bacteria in dental plaque. the purpose of the present study was to examine whether these isomers were fermented  by predominant bacteria in human dental plaque. clinical bacterial isolates obtained from dental plaque from 3 children aged 22 months to 50 months (146 strains) were inoculated into 3 ml of peptone-yeast extract (py medium) containing glucose for 1 day, then an aliquot of 20 microl of culture medium was  inoculated into 1 ml of py medium containing 1% (w/v) of the respective test carbohydrates. after incubation for 1 day, the ph values and the optical density  at 660 nm of the cultures were measured. fermentation ability was measured by ph  <or=5.5, growth by an od(660) of >or=0.5. of the clinical isolates, 33% fermented palatinose, and 69% of these were actinomyces species. all of the palatinose-fermenting bacterial strains fermented trehalulose, 25% fermented turanose, 70% fermented maltulose and 23% fermented leucrose. we therefore conclude that, in human dental plaque, there are significant numbers of bacteria  that are able to ferment sucrose isomers.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase iv activity of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. we previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase iv (dapiv) from p. gingivalis. in the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of  passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab) capable of inhibiting the dapiv activity of p. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant  dapiv as an immunogen. the constructed mab, designated as mab-pg-dap-1, significantly inhibited dapiv activity in p. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus. furthermore, the mab did  not inhibit dapiv enzyme activity in human serum. this novel mab may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.

TI  == antibacterial property of isoflavonoids isolated from erythrina variegata against cariogenic oral bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial property of 7 compounds, isolated from erythrina variegata (leguminosae) by repeated silica gel column chromatography, against cariogenic oral bacteria was investigated. extensive spectroscopic study revealed that all were isoflavonoids. among them, 3,9-dihydroxy-2,10-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-6a,11a-dehydropterocarpan (erycristagallin) showed the highest antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci, other oral streptococci, actinomyces and lactobacillus species with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 1.56-6.25 microg/ml, followed by 3,6a-dihydroxy-9-methoxy-2,10-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)pterocarpan (erystagallina) and 9-hydroxy-3-methoxy-2-gamma,gamma-dimethylallylpterocarpan (orientanol b) (mic range: 3.13-12.5 microg/ml). the antibacterial effect of erycristagallin to mutans streptococci was based on a bactericidal action. erycristagallin (6.25 microg/ml: mic) completely inhibited incorporation of radio-labelled thymidine into streptococcus mutans cells. incorporation of radio-labelled glucose into bacterial cells was also strongly inhibited at mic, and 1/2 mic of the compound reduced the incorporation approximately by half. the  findings indicate that erycristagallin has a potential as potent phytochemical agent for prevention of dental caries by inhibiting the growth of cariogenic bacteria and by interfering with incorporation of glucose responsible for production of organic acids.

TI  == pcr method is essential for detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  == tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. m. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. to evaluate the risk of m. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of m. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the detection rates by pcr in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. the detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. m. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. strains of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of m. tuberculosis, but strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. the present study concludes that the pcr method is essential for detecting m. tuberculosis in oral samples.

TI  == comparison of antibacterial activity of simplified adhesive systems.
AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the intrinsic antibacterial activity of commercially available simplified adhesive systems. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of five self-etching/priming one-step adhesives and three  priming/bonding adhesives against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and  actinomyces viscosus was assessed by the agar disc-diffusion test and determination of the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). twenty microl of each adhesive was impregnated into a paper disc and placed on an agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension, with or without light-irradiation. the size of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of incubation. the mic values were measured by serial microdilution assays, visually examining the growth of bacteria after incubation  with each adhesive for 24-48 hours. the subcultures were made on bhi agar plates  from the wells showing no visible growth of bacteria, and the mbc values were determined based on production of colonies. two primers in two-step self-etching  systems and an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine were tested for reference. the results of disc-diffusion tests were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test. results: the size of inhibition zones produced by adhesives varied among the brands. none of the available commercial adhesives showed significant inhibition against all three of the bacterial species tested. light-irradiation reduced the size of inhibition zones for a few materials, but a similar trend to the effectiveness of non-irradiated specimens was observed. the  antibacterial activity of commercial products determined in terms of mic/mbc values were different from the results by disc-diffusion tests. the self-etching  adhesives with low ph were not necessarily more effective than priming/bonding solutions, and no significant relationships between the acidity and antibacterial effects were found. compared with commercial products, an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine produced significantly larger inhibition zones against all species (p < 0.05) and exhibited greater bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity, demonstrating lower mic/mbc values.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  == the objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (gic). this was assessed using an agar diffusion test. chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to fuji  ix gic at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. antibacterial-gic specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (streptococcis, lactobacillus, and actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. the experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. control specimens of the gic produced no bacterial inhibition. the antibacterial-gic combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on  week 1. ct-gic showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. the addition of antibacterial agents to fuji ix creates a gic material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.

TI  == effect of sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish on streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus in orthodontic patients.
AB  == this study evaluated the effect of sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish on orthodontic patients. ten children, ages 10 to 16 years, participated. bacterial  levels of streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus and total counts were evaluated in sputum samples. these counts were evaluated at 4 stages: before orthodontic treatment, at least 2 weeks after bonding of the brackets, 1 week after application of chlorhexidine varnish, and 3 weeks after application of chlorhexidine varnish. increases in bacterial levels of s mutans and in the total bacterial count were detected after the brackets were bonded. one week after the  sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish was applied, a significant decrease of total bacterial levels and s mutans was observed. this decrease persisted for 3 weeks after the first application. no significant change in a viscosus levels occurred during that period. the results provide additional evidence that sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish decreases s mutans levels in orthodontic  patients with fixed appliances and therefore might be useful in preventing caries lesions.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

TI  == effects of nitrite and nitrate on the growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == it is hypothesised that exogenous nitrite acidified by metabolic products of acidogenic bacteria in the mouth will be converted to products which inhibit growth of the bacteria in question which contribute to dental caries. objectives: the aims of this study were (1) to test the activity of both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite at differing concentrations on the ability of streptococcus mutans to lower the ph of its surroundings and hence (2) to determine whether either nitrate or nitrite might be bactericidal or bacteriostatic against s. mutans. methods: s. mutans nctc 10449(t) was cultured in a liquid medium to which either  sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to a final concentration of 0.0, 0.2,  2.0, 20 or 200 mm, of which the first acted as a test substance negative control. after 24 h, the cultures were streaked onto agar to test for growth and the remaining culture used for ph measurement. the mann-whitney u-test was used for statistical comparison of ph values. results: nitrite at concentrations of 20 and 200 mm had a highly significant inhibitory effect (p < 0.001) on the ability of s. mutans nctc 10449(t) to lower ph. moreover, bacteria that had been subjected to these levels of nitrite were unable to recover on solid medium. nitrate had no such effect on either the growth of the bacteria or on their ability to lower ph. conclusions: it is concluded that nitrite, at final concentrations of either 20 or 200 mm, is both bactericidal and anti-acidogenic with respect to s. mutans, while lower concentrations of nitrite and all concentrations of nitrate are ineffective. nitrite might be worthy of consideration as a mouth-rinse constituent.

AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine and compare the antimicrobial action of a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan with a lipid-depleting detergent-based handwash product with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate. the zones of inhibition produced by the two handwash lotions and the one produced by the positive control were similar against all strains of bacteria tested, indicating  that a urea-based handwash lotion with triclosan is as effective as a lipid-depleting handwash lotion in inhibiting bacterial activity.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == the association of bacterial adhesion with dental caries.
AB  == saliva adhesion of bacteria is a key event in oral biofilm formation. here, we used partial least-squares (pls) analysis to correlate adhesion of cariogenic (streptococcus mutans ingbritt) and commensal (actinomyces naeslundii ly7) model  bacteria, and their agglutinin and acidic proline-rich protein ligands, respectively, with high and low caries experiences in 38 children reflecting today's skewed caries distribution. adhesion of s. mutans was among the factors correlating strongest with high caries experience when pls modeled together with  traditional factors (e.g., sugar intake, lactobacilli counts). saliva phenotypes  with high agglutinin levels and db-s (an acidic prp variant) coincided with both  high caries experience and s. mutans adhesion. a. naeslundii adhesion correlated  with low caries experience. non-db phenotypes (i.e., acidic prp-1 and prp-2 variants) coincided with both low caries experience and s. mutans, but high a. naeslundii, adhesion. thus, bacterial adhesion may modulate susceptibility and resistance to dental caries.

TI  == proteolytic degradation of oral biofilms in vitro and in vivo: potential of proteases originating from euphausia superba for plaque control.
AB  == this paper deals with enzymatic removal of dental plaque, in vitro as well as in  vivo, using proteases from the antarctic krill shrimp (euphausia superba), referred to as krillase. krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. in model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms. krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results showed that krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque  in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. the surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of  a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. krillase was also able to remove  plaque accumulated on dentures in vivo. our results demonstrate the potential of  krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == alteration of the coadherence of candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  == interactions between bacterial oral flora and candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. this study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of c. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine  triphosphate (atp) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. when yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (ynb) supplemented with 250 mm glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of streptoccus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus and actinomyces. however, when the yeast was precultured in ynb supplemented with 500 mm galactose, the yeast coadhered with s. salivarius and actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in ynb with glucose. in addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of s. sanguis was significantly reduced. enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.

TI  == bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  == this study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans or actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of  buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. on average, s. sanguis was the  easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while a. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). the combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including ph, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

AB  == to produce a bonding system which has both high bond strength and antibacterial properties, an antibacterial agent (vancomycin: vcm or metronidazol: mn) was added to the pmma powder of 4-meta/mma-tbb resin (cb). the influence of the addition of an antibacterial agent on tensile bond strength to dentin and the antibacterial effect were investigated in this study. forty-seven freshly extracted bovine first or second incisors were used to measure the tensile bond strength to dentin. the bond strengths to bovine dentin were not significantly decreased by addition of vcm (1%, 2%, 5%), or mn (1%) to cb (p < 0.05). the antibacterial effect of cb containing antibacterial agent on six strains of bacteria was investigated by the agar plate diffusion method, analyzing the appearance of the inhibition zone around a resin disk following anaerobic culturing. the resin disks containing vcm showed antibacterial effects on all of  the strains examined; the widths of the inhibition zones were 4-15 mm. the resin  disks containing mn showed antibacterial effects on three strains; the widths of  the inhibition zones were 0-4 mm. it was thus possible to produce a bonding system with both antibacterial effect and high tensile bond strength by addition  of vcm to pmma powder.

TI  == the role of fructans on dental biofilm formation by streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == dental plaque biofilm plays a pivotal role in the progression of dental diseases. polysaccharides are of great importance in the ecology of the dental biofilm. we  studied the effect of fructans, glucans and a mixture of both fructans and glucans, synthesized in situ by immobilized fructosyltransferase or glucosyltransferase, on the adhesion of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces viscosus to hydroxyapatite beads coated with human saliva (sha). the adhesion of a. viscosus to sha was found to be fructan-dependent. adhesion of both s. sobrinus and s. mutans was found to be  mediated mainly by glucans, while the adhesion of s. gordonii was found to be both glucan- and fructan-dependent. treatment with fructanase prior to a. viscosus adhesion resulted in a significant reduction in adhesion to sha, while adhesion of s. sobrinus, s. mutans and s. gordonii was slightly influenced by fructanase treatment. treatment with fructanase after adhesion of s. gordonii to  sha resulted in a significant reduction in their adhesion to sha. our results show that fructans may play a role in the adhesion and colonization of several cariogenic bacteria to sha, thus contributing to the formation of dental plaque biofilm.

AB  == the aim of our study was to determine whether the structure of glucans formed by  glucosyltransferase from streptococcus sanguinis (gtfss) on a surface differ from those formed in solution and to explore the effects of antiserum to gtfs, control normal rabbit serum, starch hydrolysates (sth) and dextran on s. sanguinis (gtfss) glucan. linkage analyses showed that solution-formed glucans are predominantly alpha-1,6-linked and have a small amount of alpha-1,3-linked glucose. surface-formed glucans have enhanced susceptibility to mutanase. solution- and surface-formed glucans made in the presence or absence of sera, sth, and dextran contain linkages which differ in both amount and type from control glucans. the gtfss enzyme in solution exposed to antiserum behaves as if  it is adsorbed to a surface. binding of streptococcus mutans gs-5 and actinomyces viscosus omz105e (ny1) to s. sanguinis glucan differs if the glucan is formed in  the presence of antiserum. the information could help to define the role of glucans in the formation of pellicle, colonization of tooth surfaces and the accumulation of dental plaque.

TI  == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces naeslundii. whereas the growth of s. mutans was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after 24 h of exposure. similar effects were observed with a. naeslundii and l. casei. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also markedly affected by nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 7, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of s. mutans, with similar effects on the other organisms tested. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva has an effect on the growth and survival of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == studies concerning the glucosyltransferase of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == we have shown in previous studies that the glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzymes of streptococcus mutans have distinct properties when adsorbed to a surface. in the  present study, we compared the activity of gtf from streptococcus sanguis, designated gtfss, in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  (sha) beads, and determined the ability of its product glucan to support the adherence of oral microorganisms. gtf from s. sanguis 804 nctc 10904 was purified from culture supernatant fluids by means of hydroxyapatite chromatography. enzyme and the substrate were prepared in buffers at ph values from 3.5 to 7.5. maximum  activity of gtfss occurred between ph 5.5 and ph 6.5, whether in solution or adsorbed onto a surface. the solubilized and insolubilized enzymes showed highest activity at 40 degrees c; activity was reduced by 50(+/-2)% at 20 and 30 degrees  c. the enzyme did not form glucans in either phase at 10 or 60 degrees c. the k(m), determined from lineweaver-burk plots, for the enzyme in solution was 4.3(+/-0.4) mmol/l sucrose, and the k(m) for the enzyme on sha beads was 5.0(+/-1.0) mmol/l sucrose. the ability of the gtfss glucan synthesized on the surface of sha beads to support the adherence of oral bacteria was investigated.  (3)h-thymidine-labeled bacteria (s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus 6715, s. sobrinus 6716, s. sanguis 10904, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, a. viscosus 2085, and a. viscosus 2086) were incubated with sha beads coated with gtfss glucan. s. mutans  gs-5 displayed the highest level of binding numerically. these results show that  the gtfss of s. sanguis is active on sha beads, that the ph optimum for activity  on a surface differs slightly from that in solution, and that its product glucan  can support the adherence of oral microorganisms.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative  materials--an in vitro study.
AB  == three tooth-coloured, resin-based restorative materials (charisma, dyract, and pertac) were exposed to typical oral bacteria (s. mutans, s. oralis and a. naeslundii) over a period of up to 35 days. the three strains of bacteria all colonised the resin-based materials within a few hours and formed thick bacterial films. determination of the bacterial glucose consumption and lactate production  during the incubation period showed no difference from the controls which contained no resin samples. following the experimental exposure, the materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) for possible surface damage and roughness was measured in a perthometer. little damage to the resin-based composite material surfaces (charisma, pertac) could be observed, whereas the polyacid-modified composite material (dyract) showed greater damage. there was a  significant difference in the resin surface roughness after exposure to s. mutans and to a. naeslundii. the study clearly showed that the bacteria used strongly adhered to the resin-based restorative materials. as a consequence of bacterial colonisation and/or poor oral hygiene, damage to the restorative materials might  develop. this suggests the need for dentists to evaluate personal oral hygiene, along with general indications and economic factors, in selecting materials for restorations, since the known anti-bacterial properties of amalgam are considerable.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == [the effect of removable partial denture on the composition of bacteria on the apt-to-decay site of abutment teeth].
AB  == this study was aimed at the composition of plaques which were on the base teeth's carious sensitive sites, just after the insertion of the removable partial denture (rpd). the results showed that the ratios of bacterial detection in different teeth at the same period and those on the different sites of same teeth at different periods were not significantly different. there was a tendency that  the detection ratio of the stomatococcus at the early period was higher than that of other bacteria, but at the middle period the ratios declined, and at the late  period it was higher again. the detection ratio of the bacillus was on the contrary in the study. at the same time, the composition of the plaques changed significantly after the dentures had been used for 7, 14, and 21 days and 3 months. after 3 months, the ratios of the stomatococcus and the bacillas returned to their normal levels. the 3 main cariogenic bacteria were all detected in this  study. the streptococcus mutant was the dominant bacterium in the plaques and its ratio went up with the time duration. the ratio for the lower second molar was higher than that for the mandibular second premolar (p < 0.05). the detection ratios of the actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus were lower. in conclusion, after the insertion of rpd, the oral microbial ecosystem would be changed and the cariogenic bacteria began to implant on the surface of the base teeth. so rpd is  a potential factor to cause the caries.

TI  == development of multi-species consortia biofilms of oral bacteria as an enamel and root caries model system.
AB  == the aim was to establish defined-species consortium plaque biofilms to investigate enamel and root caries in an artificial mouth. strains of the putative enamel and root caries pathogens, streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus, were screened in batch culture for potential cariogenic properties: a low terminal ph, ability to aggregate, and catabolic diversity. the strains selected were grown as monoculture biofilms and as consortium plaque biofilms in a multiplaque artificial mouth. the biofilms were supplied with a constant flow of a simulated  oral fluid and were given periodic sucrose (and in some instances glucose) to simulate meals. all the bacteria except l. rhamnosus formed large, monospecies biofilms with resting ph in the range 5.3-5.8. the consortia biofilms were larger and had a resting ph of 4.9-5.3. the consortia biofilms supplied with 8-hourly carbohydrate comprised mainly 'mutans' streptococci (58, sd 5.5%) and l. rhamnosus (42, sd 5.7%). a. naeslundii characteristically was absent or present in a low percentage (up to 4% colony-forming units). all biofilms demineralized polished bovine enamel and dentine blocks, as assessed by microradiography and enamel-surface microhardness measurement. the consortia also demineralized intact enamel and tooth roots; they were more cariogenic to enamel than any of the monoculture biofilms, as measured by enamel-surface softening, but variation in lesion depth was proportional to biofilm wet weight irrespective of acidogen composition (r = 0.93, p < 0.05). enamel lesions had a well-mineralized intact surface and a zone of subsurface demineralization, typical of early natural lesions. dentine and root lesions showed extensive demineralization but lacked a  pronounced surface mineralized zone. substitution of glucose for sucrose had no effect on the cariogenicity of the consortium to bovine enamel or human roots and had no major effect on the plaque composition. continuously supplied fluoride (19 parts/10(6)) resulted in a substantially reduced enamel surface softening and subsurface demineralization of intact roots. it was concluded that consortia biofilms of selected caries pathogens generate realistic caries lesions in all tooth hard tissues under controlled growth conditions in the artificial mouth. this in vitro caries experimental model may prove useful for the study of interrelations between the plaque biofilm, tooth tissues and the oral environment, and for the development of procedures to modify the course of caries development.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

AB  == background: while streptococcus mutans and actinomyces spp are considered to be major pathogenic microorganisms of root caries, their roles in the degradation of organic matrix components of human root dentin need clarification. methods: ten laboratory strains and 11 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and actinomyces species, and positive bacterial or purified enzyme controls (porphyromonas gingivalis whole cell lysates, trypsin or clostridial collagenase) were used to establish the degradation of azocollagen (ac), insoluble type i collagen (ic) or human dentin collagen (dc) from dentin powder in two types of experiments investigating collagenolytic activity either during or after bacterial growth. ultraviolet-irradiated dentin powder and gamma-irradiated ic were used to assess the collagenolytic activity of test strains during bacterial  growth. ac, ic and acid-treated dentin powder were used to determine the collagenolytic activity of sonicated bacterial whole cells and cell-free culture  supernatants recovered from test strains after growth. hydroxyproline or spectrophotometric assays were used to analyze the level of degraded collagen. results: data from this study showed that in contrast to the positive controls, none of the laboratory strains or clinical isolates elicited significant degradation of ac, ic or dc. conclusions: results indicated that mutans streptococci and actinomyces species had no significant collagenolytic activity,  but may be involved in the root caries process through other mechanisms. in addition, proteolytic enzymes from other oral bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis or from host cells such as neutrophils may also participate in the pathogenesis of root caries.

TI  == mutans streptococci and other caries-associated acidogenic bacteria in five-year-old children in south africa.
AB  == correlations between mutans streptococci and caries are inconsistent; some studies show that early caries may occur with other bacterial species possessing  the ability to survive, interact and compete with mutans streptococci. this study looked at the relationship between mutans streptococci, lactobacillus, actinomyces and veillonella in saliva and plaque collected from four tooth sites  in two ethnic groups, with and without caries. all samples were collected and cultured onto selective media. colonies were enumerated and identified using biochemical tests. pearson correlations showed low yet statistically significant  correlations between plaque mutans streptococci counts and the number of decayed  surfaces (ds) and decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs) of primary teeth in blacks and in coloreds (historical race classification). salivary mutans streptococci counts correlated with ds and dmfs in coloreds. no relationship was  found between ds, dmfs and lactobacillus, actinomyces or veillonella numbers. significant associations were evident between plaque mutans streptococci and veillonella and lactobacillus in black children with caries and between plaque mutans streptococci and actinomyces and lactobacillus and veillonella in colored  children. hence, oral microbes are in constant flux but have interrelationships in children with caries.

TI  == effect of salivary biofilm on the adherence of oral bacteria to bleached and non-bleached restorative material.
AB  == objective: the objective of this work was to examine the effect of in vitro salivary biofilm on the adherence of oral bacteria to bleached and non-bleached restorative material (charisma). methods: charisma samples, prepared in silicon models, were treated with either 10% carbamide peroxide (cp) or 10% hydrogen peroxide (hp). after incubation with the bleaching agent for a period of one, two or three days, the samples were coated with freshly collected human saliva. the adsorption pattern of the saliva to the restorative material was determined using gel electrophoresis coupled with computerized densitometry techniques. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed onto the treated surfaces was measured using the bradford method. sucrose-dependent bacterial adhesion to the salivary-coated charisma was tested using radio-labeled streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus. adhesion of each bacterium to surfaces pretreated with the bleaching agents was compared with saliva coated bleached surfaces. results: the profile of salivary proteins adsorption followed a similar pattern in charisma samples pretreated with either cp or hp or untreated samples. however, the total amount of salivary proteins adsorbed onto the samples decreased after bleaching with cp or hp. salivary biofilm, coating the surface of the restorative material, significantly decreased sucrose-dependent adhesion of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus mutans to the bleached and non-bleached  surfaces, compared to non-coated specimens (p < 0.05). saliva had a minor effect  on adhesion of actinomyces viscosus. significance: our study demonstrates the importance of salivary biofilm in controlling adhesion of oral bacteria to restorative material pretreated with bleaching agents or untreated.

AB  == a group of 20 students, harbouring >10(4) mutans streptococci per millilitre of saliva, was enrolled into the study. models for sampling, reproducibly, the dental plaque present in specific sites (fissure and smooth surface) on the dentition were developed and validated. withdrawal of normal oral hygiene procedures for only 1 day resulted in approximately 10-fold increases in the number of micro-organisms recovered from both sites. the effect of supplementing  the subjects' diets with particular food items given 5 times per day [lemonade (5.8% w/v sugars, 250 ml), biscuits (digestive biscuits, 67.6% w/w carbohydrate of which 22% w/w was sugars and 45.6% w/w was starch), caramel toffees and sugar  lumps] on the number of micro-organisms recovered and on the composition of the flora at both sites was determined. dental plaque samples were taken after 5 days and it was found that supplementation of the diet with toffee and sugar lumps resulted in significantly more micro-organisms at both sampling sites. the supplementation of the diets with lemonade or biscuits did not significantly alter the numbers of micro-organisms recovered from either site. the percentage composition of the plaque samples from both dental sites remained relatively unaffected by oral hygiene although there were lower levels of mutans streptococci which might be related to the use of an antimicrobial toothpaste containing fluoride, triclosan and zinc citrate. this study suggests that the cariogenicity of certain sucrose-containing foods may, in part, be due to the enhancement of plaque accumulation in addition to other effects on the percentage composition of the plaque which may become manifest on prolonged usage of these dietary foodstuffs. these observations are consistent with dietary survey findings which often find consumption of confectionery related to caries experience or incidence.

AB  == the present study was carried out to establish the normal bacterial oral flora and the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora from deep seated dental caries, and to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity of the clinical isolates so obtained streptococcus mutans (48%) and streptococcus sanguis (20%) were the main aerobic  isolates whereas lactobacillus spp. (52%), veillonella spp. (24%) and actinomyces spp. (12%) were the major anaerobic isolates. hundred percent of the samples from dental caries yielded polymicrobial isolates while in two samples from healthy individuals s. mutans was the sole isolate. as the flora changed from healthy tooth to dental caries it changed from one predominated by anaerobic gram-positive cocci to anaerobic gram-positive bacilli. all the anaerobes isolated were sensitive to metronidazole and cefotaxime, whereas all the isolated streptococci were sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. incorporation of the antibiotics in baseline restoration, if technically feasible, has been advocated.

AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == three kinds of antibacterial substances from lentinus edodes (berk.) sing. (shiitake, an edible mushroom).
AB  == three kinds of antibacterial substances were extracted by chloroform, ethylacetate or water from dried shiitake mushrooms (lentinus edodes). these substances possess efficient antibacterial activities against streptococcus spp., actinomyces spp., lactobacillus spp., prevotella spp., and porphyromonas spp. of  oral origin. in contrast, other general bacteria, such as enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp., escherichia spp., bacillus spp., and candida spp. were relatively resistant to these substances. chloroform extracts had bactericidal activity against both growing and resting bacterial cells of s. mutans and p. intermedia, whereas the other two extracts showed bacteriostatic activity against both growing and resting bacterial cells of s. mutans and resting bacterial cell  of p. intermedia. the antibacterial activity of chloroform extracts and ethylacetate extracts were relatively heat-stable. the water extract was heat-labile.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers: an in vitro evaluation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers after 2, 20 and 40 days. the sealers studied were apexit, endion, ah26, ah-plus. procosol and ketac endo. the microorganisms used were candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces israelii. petri dishes were filled with sterile agar and 0.1-ml wells were prepared and filled with the sealers. the agar plates were stored for 24 h at 37  degrees c. the samples were then removed, immersed in 4.5 ml of culture medium and divided into three groups. the samples in group 1 were stored for 2 days at 37 degrees c whereas the samples of groups 2 and 3 were stored at 4 degrees c for 20 and 40 days respectively. the samples were then removed and discarded, and 0.1 ml of the culture medium was seeded on the agar plates in order to perform colony forming unit counts. apexit, endion and ah-plus produced slight inhibition on streptococcus mutans at 20 days and on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. no effect was found on candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. ketac endo only produced an antimicrobial effect on actinomyces israelii at 2 and 40 days. ah26 and procosol showed antimicrobial effect at 40 days on candida albicans, at 20 and 40 days on streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus, and an effective inhibition on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. statistical analysis revealed both sealers and microorganisms to be significant factors affecting results in groups 2 and 3. in conclusion, the sealers evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects depending on time span. overall, sealers containing cugenol and formaldehyde proved to be most effective  against the microorganisms at the time intervals studied.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of amalgams, alloys and their elements and phases.
AB  == objectives: this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of amalgams, alloys, elements and phases against two cariogenic bacteria, actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans. methods: test materials comprised: (i) commercial amalgams comprising amalcap (vivadent), cavex avalloy lc and dp (cavex), cupromuc (merz), fluoralloy and synalloy (dentoria); (ii) ag-cu alloy; (iii) gamma, gamma 1, gamma 2 and cu6sn5 phases; (iv) pure metal samples and chloride solutions of copper, mercury, tin and zinc; and (v) aqueous sodium fluoride. bacterial suspensions of each of the two bacteria were grown in the presence of the test materials for 24 h. antimicrobial effectiveness was assessed by measuring reduction in optical density at 640 nm using a visible spectrophotometer. results: cupromuc/fluoralloy, non gamma 2 amalgams and amalcap displayed high, moderate and no antibacterial activity, respectively. antibacterial effectiveness was not related to copper content. whereas mercury, copper, ag-cu alloy, fluoride and zinc showed antibacterial activity (hg > cu > f > zn), tin, gamma phases and cu6sn5 showed no such activity. significance: although the fluoride and copper solutions were most effective at 50 micrograms ml-1 concentration, their antibacterial action was still significant, albeit reduced, at 10 micrograms ml-1 concentration. this was not the case for mercury chloride which was just as effective at both concentrations. our results show that although mercury and copper contribute significantly to the antibacterial properties of amalgams, a high copper content does not necessarily relate to high antibacterial effectiveness. these elements could be useful in conferring antibacterial properties to amalgam although their effects on host cells must be  investigated.

TI  == a synthetic peptide adhesion epitope as a novel antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the earliest step in microbial infection is adherence by specific microbial adhesins to the mucosa of the oro-intestinal, nasorespiratory, or genitourinary tract. we inhibited binding of a cell surface adhesin of streptococcus mutans to  salivary receptors in vitro, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, using a synthetic peptide (p1025) corresponding to residues 1025-1044 of the adhesin. two residues within p1025 that contribute to binding (q1025, e1037) were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. in an in vivo human streptococcal adhesion model, direct application of p1025 to the teeth prevented recolonization of s. mutans but not actinomyces, as compared with a control peptide or saline. this novel antimicrobial strategy, applying competitive peptide inhibitors of adhesion, may  be used against other microorganisms in which adhesins mediate colonization of mucosal surfaces.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

TI  == antibacterial activity of proprietary self-etching primers.
AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the in vitro antibacterial activity of three self-etching primers. materials and methods: lb primer (liner bond 2), fb primer  (fluoro bond), and mb conditioner (tokuso mac bond) were evaluated. the antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces viscosus was assessed using the agar disc-diffusion method. twenty microliters of each primer were impregnated into a paper disc and placed on a brain heart infusion agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension. the size  of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of  incubation of the plate. in addition, 20 microliters of each primer was added to  a 1 ml suspension of s. mutans adjusted to 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(5), or 1 x 10(4) cfu/ml in phosphate buffered saline and kept in contact for 30 seconds. the number of viable bacteria after contact with each primer was determined. the results were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test (p < 0.05). results: lb primer and fb primer produced inhibition zones against s. mutans and a. viscosus, and mb conditioner produced an inhibition zone only against a. viscosus. no inhibition zones were produced by any of the primers against l. casei. the three  primers completely killed 1 x 10(4) cfu of s. mutans within 30 seconds of contact. when 1 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(6) cfu of bacterial cells were kept in contact, significant differences in the number of recovered viable cells were found among  the three primers with mb conditioner being the most bactericidal. lb primer had  little bactericidal activity and the mean reduction of viable bacteria by fb primer and mb conditioner was approximately 30% and 65%, respectively.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

AB  == the correlation between the number of blood polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmns) and the counts of oral bacteria in 92 children (33 girls and 59 boys), aged 4-15  was investigated. the groups of children comprised 44 healthy individuals and 48  children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who were given intensive antileukaemic chemotherapy. it was found that while the number of pmns in blood decreased, the counts of streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp., mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp., and actinomyces spp. in the saliva tended to increase. the similar reciprocal correlation between the number of blood pmns and the counts of these bacteria in the saliva was found in the group of healthy children. we concluded that the blood pmns, by influencing the number of oral pmns which control bacteria in this habitat, influence also the number of some groups of bacteria there.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

AB  == the binding specificities of streptococcus glucosyltransferase (gtf) b, c and d for hydroxyapatite (ha), saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha), and bacterial surfaces were examined. for ha beads the following values were obtained: (k = affinity; n = number of binding sites) gtfb, k = 46 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.65 x  10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 86 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 4.42 x 10(-6) mumol/m2.; gtfd, k = 100 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.83 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. for sha beads, the following values were obtained: gtfb, k = 14.7 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 1.03 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 21.3 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 3.66 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfd, k = 1.73 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 8.88 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. the binding of gtfb  to sha beads was reduced in the presence of parotid saliva, but the binding of gtfc and d was unaffected. the binding of gtfb to sha in the presence of parotid  saliva supplemented with gtfc and d was reduced when compared with its binding to sha in the presence of parotid saliva alone. in contrast, te binding of gtfc and  sha was unaffected when parotid saliva was supplemented with the other gtf enzymes. gtfb bound to several bacterial strains (strep, mutans gs-5, actinomyces viscosus omz105e and lactobacillus casei 4646) in an active form, while gtfc and  d did not bind to bacterial surfaces. it is concluded that of the three gtf enzymes, gtfc has the highest affinity for ha and sha surfaces and can adsorb on  the the sha surface in the presence of the other two enzymes. gtfd also binds to  sha in the presence of the other enzymes but has a very low affinity for the surface. gtfb does not bind to sha in the presence of the other gtf enzymes but binds avidly to bacterial surfaces in an active form. therefore, gtfc most probably binds to apatitic surfaces, while gtfb binds to bacterial surfaces.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == agglutinin and acidic proline-rich protein receptor patterns may modulate bacterial adherence and colonization on tooth surfaces.
AB  == bacterial binding to salivary proteins may in part account for individual differences in the colonization of tooth surfaces. high-molecular-weight glycoproteins, agglutinins, mediate s. mutans adherence, whereas acidic proline-rich proteins mediate adherence of other early-colonizing streptococci and actinomyces. the aim of the present study was to examine the composition of adherence-related salivary proteins and dental plaque micro-organisms in three individuals with a low, moderate, and high capacity to mediate s. mutans adherence. the s. mutans (strain ingbritt) binding activity resided with a 300-kda agglutinin which was six-fold more prevalent in the high s. mutans binding saliva compared with the low one. binding to all three salivas was completely blocked by a monoclonal anti-agglutinin antibody. the moderate s. mutans binding saliva was found to contain adherence-inhibiting components. furthermore, the low and moderate s. mutans binding salivas mediated binding of a. naeslundii strain ly7 to a greater extent than the saliva with high s. mutans  binding. the a. naeslundii binding activity resided with the acidic proline-rich  proteins (aprps) and paralleled the relative content of 106- and 150-residue aprps. low a. naeslundii binding coincided with an almost two-fold higher ratio of 106/150 aprps compared with the high a. naeslundii binding saliva. during conventional gel filtration, a degradation of the acidic, basic, and glycosylated proline-rich proteins was evident in the saliva with high s. mutans and low a. naeslundii binding. this saliva donor had a comparably high rate of dental plaque formation, high counts of s. mutans, and low counts of other streptococci and actinomyces.

AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

TI  == enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

TI  == antimicrobial compounds from ceanothus americanus against oral pathogens.
AB  == during the search for antimicrobial compounds from higher plant sources, a methanol extract of ceanothus americanus demonstrated antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. through further bioassay-guided fractionation and purification, three triterpenes (ceanothic acid, 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid) and two flavonoids (maesopsin and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside) were identified. among these, ceanothetric acid and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside were  new compounds. ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid demonstrated growth inhibitory effect against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia with mics ranging from 42 to  625 micrograms ml-1. maesopsin, its glucoside, and 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid, were inactive below the concentration of 500 micrograms ml-1.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.
AB  == an antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. interaction between the material (termed) oais) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. seven species of streptococcus and two actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to oais revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. the results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to oais. gel electrophoresis revealed that oais could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the strep. mutans strain to oais in a dose-dependent manner. the results indicate that oais adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. a major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.

TI  == inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

TI  == incorporation of antibacterial monomer mdpb into dentin primer.
AB  == the polymerizable monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) shows antibacterial activity when immobilized in a resin-based material. in this study, the antibacterial effect of a dentin primer incorporating mdpb was investigated.  the influence of incorporation of mdpb on bond strength to dentin and on the curing performance of the adhesive system was also evaluated. experimental primers were prepared by addition of mdpb into a proprietary primer at 1, 2, or 5%. antibacterial effects of experimental primers were compared with those of control primer and two other proprietary primers by an agar disc-diffusion method and bactericidal activity test. experimental primers produced greater inhibition  zones against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei than any of three proprietary primers, and inhibition increased as the concentration of mdpb was increased. bactericidal activity of mdpb-containing primers against streptococcus mutans was greater than those of the other three primers, with incorporation of mdpb at 5% showing complete killing of bacteria after 30 s contact. no decrease in tensile bond strength was observed for materials containing mdpb. on the contrary, the primer incorporating 1 and 2% mdpb showed higher bond strength than all the others, including the control (p <  0.05). when the degree of conversion of the complex of primer and adhesive resin  was determined with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, there were no significant differences between any of the experimental primers and the control (p > 0.05). these results indicate that incorporation of the antibacterial monomer mdpb enhanced the antibacterial effect of a proprietary dentin primer before curing, and had no adverse influence on bond strength to dentin and curing of the adhesive system.

TI  == age-related changes in salivary antibodies to commensal oral and gut biota.
AB  == the prevalence of mucosally derived infections appears to increase with age, suggesting dysfunction at the mucosal surfaces. the present investigation was undertaken to examine any age-related changes in secretion rates and concentrations of secretory antibodies in whole and parotid saliva in a healthy adult population. a total of 116 subjects were subdivided into the following age  groups: 20-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years and 80 years and over. specific immunoglobulin a (iga), igg and igm antibodies in whole and parotid saliva to streptococcus mutans (serotype c), actinomyces viscosus nctc 10951, and escherichia coli nctc 10418 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. iga antibodies to all three organisms examined increased with age in both whole and parotid saliva, whereas igg antibody levels to s. mutans in whole saliva were significantly decreased with age. igg antibodies to e. coli in parotid saliva were reduced in older age groups. igm antibody levels to s. mutans were reduced with age in both secretions, whereas igm antibodies to a. viscosus were greatest  in the oldest age groups. no significant changes with age were observed in salivary igm antibody levels to e. coli. no significant reduction in the secretion rates of iga antibodies were observed in parotid or whole saliva, whereas igg and igm antibody secretion rates to all three microorganisms were reduced in most age groups in both whole and parotid saliva. the results of this  investigation have demonstrated age-related changes with salivary antibodies, but, whereas salivary igg and igm antibodies showed decreases, salivary iga levels generally increased with age. this suggests that the ability to form iga antibody responses is not impaired with increased age, and that secretion rates and functional properties of antibodies may be as important as concentrations in  protection against mucosal infective diseases.

TI  == variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

TI  == does assessment of microbial composition of plaque/saliva allow for diagnosis of  disease activity of individuals?
AB  == microbiological tests are limited in their applicability in the assessment of caries activity and in caries prediction. they can be effective in group of persons with high or low caries experience. the reasons for the limitation of microbiological tests rests with unique characteristics of the microflora and local environments of the oral cavity, which will modify the cariogenicity of plaque in an individual. thus, high numbers of s. mutans may be associated with the development of a lesion at a site, while a second susceptible site with high  levels of this organism in the same subject will remain caries free. this paper identifies some aspects of oral bacteria which can contribute to the unique nature of the microflora associated with plaque in an individual. firstly, the range of bacteria potentially involved in caries has widened and now includes, for example, 'low ph' non-mutans streptococci. the presence of such organisms in  plaque in an individual may influence early enamel demineralization. most significantly, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces naeslundii have been shown to be comprise many distinct clones, with different distribution among subjects. little is known of the impact of clonal diversity on caries activity but in some bacterial diseases particular clones are associated with virulence. therefore, possession of a particular clone or clones by an individual could be related to caries activity. also, the extent of clonal diversity may reflect the nature of the oral environment. recent studies suggest  that cells are released from biofilms, during adherence and growth, i.e. the early phases of development. thus, determination of the numbers of a given species in non-stimulated saliva may indicate whether it is actively growing in plaque. microbiological tests on the oral flora should perhaps be used to monitor the status of the oral cavity, after establishing a norm for the individual patient. research on species and clonal diversity of oral bacteria among human populations; diversity and its role in the caries process; and the liberation of  biofilm cells could provide data to allow better appreciation and evaluation of the results of microbiological testing.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on the bacterial colonization and degradation of dentin  and completely demineralized dentin in situ.
AB  == the effects of 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected plaque microorganisms were studied  in an intraoral dentin caries model. in 8 individuals wearing partial dentures, sound and completely demineralized dentin specimens were placed consecutively in  2 periods of 4 weeks, respectively. throughout the experimental period, the specimens were treated 2 x daily with 0.2% chlorhexidine; control specimens were  treated with water. plaque accumulation on the specimens was left undisturbed. no protection against demineralization of the dentin or degradation of the dentin collagen by the chlorhexidine treatment was observed. the chlorhexidine treatment did not result in a reduction of the total cultivable flora when compared with the control specimens. a significant reduction of mutans streptococci and total streptococci recovered from completely demineralized dentin treated with chlorhexidine was observed, but the proportions of actinomyces and lactobacilli were not affected significantly. it is speculated that areas of exposed roots, which are difficult to reach by oral hygiene measurements, such as approximal surfaces, will not be protected by a 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinse against the caries process.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. in this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pabs) and a monoclonal antibody (omvu10) on the  chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus. during growth in broth s. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pabs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pabs did not influence the growth rate of s.  sobrinus in broth. omvu10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. in order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, s. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus. no effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. however, the morphology of the s. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pabs and omvu10. the colonies were less dense and chains of s. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. after growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. it was  concluded that pabs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas  omvu10 influenced the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.

TI  == saliva mediated adherence, aggregation and prevalence in dental plaque of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces spp, in young and elderly humans.
AB  == salivary components in the pellicle mediate bacterial adherence to the tooth. such components may also aggregate bacteria in saliva and prevent them becoming established in dental plaque. in the present study, the adherence and aggregation of streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. sanguis strain 10556 and actinomyces  viscosus-strain 19246 mediated by parotid and whole saliva from groups of young and elderly people were examined. significant differences were found between test strains, salivary secretions and age groups. s. sanguis 10556 and a. viscosus 19246 generally adhered more strongly than s. mutans ingbritt, which adhered better to pellicles from parotid saliva than from whole saliva strain 19246 bound in higher numbers to parotid saliva pellicles from elderly compared to young individuals. strain 10556 adhered better to whole saliva than parotid saliva pellicles, and the difference was significant among the young individuals, indicating reduced adherence ability in elderly whole saliva. the streptococci were aggregated by parotid and whole saliva, and s. sanguis aggregation was less  with whole saliva from the elderly than from the young participants. besides a correlation between whole saliva aggregation of s. mutans and proportions of bacteria in plaque, no correlations were found for the individual binding properties of saliva and prevalence of bacteria in vivo. however, the level of saliva-mediated adherence in vitro was in the following order: s. mutans. actinomyces s sanguis, which corresponded to their isolation frequency in plaque. these findings emphasize the importance of initial adherence to salivary receptors in bacterial colonization on teeth. further studies are needed to reveal if individual patterns in the in vitro binding characteristics of saliva lead to variation of colonization in vivo.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate the shear bond strength (sbs) and microleakage (ml) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria  of aelitebond single primer restorative system. materials and methods: fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. the test specimens were prepared on  the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit sic paper. the bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees c for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. for the microleakage determination, class v cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees c and 15 degrees c in 2% methylene blue. the teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. the color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. the modified model cavity method of meryon & johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. results: the mean sbs values (in mpa) were  found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. there was no significant increase (p < 5%) in the sbs after 15 minutes. the ml of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the sbs values. the restorative system significantly (p < 5%) inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, streptococcus mutans with 42%, streptococcus sanguis with 39% and streptococcus oralis with 9%. however, the growth of veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.

TI  == a microbiological and clinical study of the safety and efficacy of baking-soda dentifrices.
AB  == this article reports the results of a study that examined the clinical and microbiological changes associated with regular use of baking-soda dentifrices. two dentifrice formulations were examined in a 6-month longitudinal study of 101  adult subjects with assessments for plaque, gingival inflammation, and stain at baseline and 3 and 6 months during the active phase of the study, and at 3 months after cessation of product use. one dentifrice contained 52% baking soda and 3% sodium percarbonate (arm & hammer peroxicare) while the other dentifrice contained 65% baking soda (arm & hammer dental care). both dentifrices resulted in statistically significant reductions in dental plaque, gingival inflammation,  and stain at all time periods compared to baseline. dental plaque and buccal soft-tissue samples were obtained for microbiological analysis from a 50-subject  subset. microbiological assays, including bacterial culture, phase-contrast microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy, confirmed the safety of both formulations. beneficial alterations in dental plaque bacteria were noted, including significant reductions in the levels of actinomyces species. the data from this study indicate that dentifrices containing high levels of baking soda are clinically effective and microbiologically safe.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota of a limited number of root caries lesions.
AB  == the microbiota of root caries lesions of different grades of severity were studied. fourteen lesions were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed correlation of histopathologically distinguishable stages with specific and distinct microbial populations. dentin samples were ground in a sterile mortar and cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, apizym, and api50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. in initial as well as in  advanced lesions gram-positive bacteria accounted for approximately 90% of the cfut. the proportion of actinomyces, and in particular a. naeslundii was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in initial lesions than in advanced lesions. in contrast, the percentage of streptococcus and especially s. mutans was higher (p  < 0.05) in advanced than in initial lesions. surprisingly low (0.8% of the cfut)  was the percentage of lactobacilli in advanced lesions. gram-negative bacteria formed a minor part of the microbiota in both initial and advanced lesions. among the gram-negative isolates, prevotella, selenomonas, and bacteroides spp. were most noticeable. in advanced lesions, only the outermost layer of 0.5 mm thickness was populated by a high number of bacteria; the following segments harbored a negligible number of bacteria only. it is concluded that root caries is a continuous destruction process which is restricted to a subsurface zone of limited depth. the necrotic dentin is successively worn away, leading to a saucer-shaped cavitation which is repopulated by plaque. the creation of cavitations favors an aciduric flora. this might explain the succession of bacterial populations observed during the destruction process.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on actinomyces naeslundii genospecies in plaque from dental fissures.
AB  == this study describes the effects of varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on actinomyces naeslundii populations in plaque from human molar fissures. in each of 15 subjects two dental fissures with high levels of mutants  streptococci were selected. the experimental treatment consisted of the single application of a small amount of chlorhexidine varnish onto the selected fissures. the varnish was removed 15 min after application. one month after varnish application a significant increase was observed in a. naeslundii counts while the number of mutans streptococci had decreased significantly compared with preexperimental levels. from 85 randomly selected actinomyces isolates taken from blood agar plates before varnish application, 44% belonged to a. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 56% to a. naeslundii genospecies 2. from 106 isolates taken 1 month after chlorhexidine varnish application, 42% belonged to a. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 58% to a. naeslundii genospecies 2. at baseline 28% of a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were catalase-positive, but 1 month after varnish application 4% of the strains were catalase-positive (p < 0.05). it is concluded that chlorhexidine varnish application caused an increase of a. naeslundii in dental plaque, but induced no significant changes in the distribution of the two a. naeslundii genospecies.

TI  == the microbiology and histopathology of human root caries.
AB  == based on numerous microbiological studies performed over the past several decades, it is clear that mutans streptococci can cause human root caries. s. mutans fulfills the criteria for implicating bacteria in the etiology of a mixed  infection. for example, s. mutans is found in high numbers in lesion sites, higher than on sound root surfaces in the same subject. subjects make elevated antibody levels to s. mutans antigens. the organism produces a number of virulence factors including metabolic acid from dietary sucrose and extracellular polysaccharides which facilitate bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces. eliminating or reducing the number of s. mutans reduces the number of root caries lesions and can even result in "healing" of incipient lesions. there is also data demonstrating the cariogenic potential of s. mutans in animal models. clearly, s. mutans fulfills the aforementioned requirements. further, there is also evidence  to implicate lactobacillus as being important in the pathogenesis of root caries  by virtue of its association with s. mutans in these lesions. there is less recent evidence regarding the importance of actinomyces in this disease. while this microorganism is present in root caries and while animal studies clearly point to their cariogenic potential, more recent studies with few exceptions fail to find much association between actinomyces and root caries. there is an important caveat, however. the actinomyces may have subspecies groups which are more highly virulent and more closely involved in the etiology of root caries than other groups. for example, a. viscosus serovar 2 is associated with root caries. this and other subspecies groups may produce certain virulence factors not found within actinomyces species as a whole. for this group of microorganisms and for other potential pathogens, techniques in molecular biology such as 16s ribosomal rna sequencing offers the hope of more precisely defining species and unraveling what may be largely problems in bacterial taxonomy. ribosomal rna sequencing may reveal taxonomic relationships not apparent with classical phenotypic or serologic analyses. other molecular methods, such as dna or rna probes to specific virulence factors may also reveal relationships between clinical lesions and microorganisms possessing these virulence factors. finally,  there are clearly a number of additional species which may have importance in root surface caries as shown in some studies. these techniques can be used to identify the distribution of novel, even uncultivable bacteria in root caries lesions and in this way establish their role in this important disease.

TI  == enhanced bactericidal activity of arm and hammer dental care.
AB  == purpose: to compare and contrast antibacterial activities of a baking soda-containing dentifrice, arm and hammer dental care (ahdc) with two fluoride dentifrices without baking soda (crest and colgate). materials and methods: a biphasic approach was taken, utilizing newly-developed laboratory model systems to: (1) assess the activity of brief exposure to dentifrices on single and mixed  cultures; and (2) determine the effect of multiple, short-term exposure of sucrose-colonized streptococcus mutans to simulate cumulative activity against cariogenic plaque. results: the short-term exposure assays revealed that s. mutans was significantly more susceptible to ahdc than either crest of colgate (p<0.05). moreover, exposure of mixed suspensions of bacteria by ahdc resulted in complete killing of actinomyces viscosus and significantly greater decreases in s. mutans (p<0.05). this enhanced bactericidal effect was not due to an alkaline  ph as ph-adjusted ahdc solutions exhibited similar activity. the comprehensive in vitro plaque studies showed that exposure of colonized s. mutans to ahdc resulted in significantly greater decreases in numbers of viable cells than crest (p<0.05). under the conditions employed, the baking soda-containing ahdc exhibited greater antibacterial efficacy overall than the standard crest or colgate pastes. these studies suggest that the use of ahdc may provide additional clinical benefit as a result of the enhanced bactericidal activity.

TI  == experimental root surface caries in hamsters the development of the disease after inoculations of two types of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the development of root surface caries in hamsters fed a high-sucrose diet over a 24-week period after inoculations of two types of cariogenic bacteria. twenty-one day old male golden hamsters (n = 103) were divided into 5 groups. four groups were given diet 2000, and one group  was given a stock diet ce-2, of the groups given diet 2000, three groups were infected with actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987 and streptococcus mutans ntcc 10449 separately (av and sm groups) or in combination (avsm group), and one group remained uninfected. a grid method was used to evaluate the plaque accumulation,  alveolar bone loss, and root surface caries. after 12 weeks, root surface caries  developed mainly on the first mandibular molars in the three infected groups. at  24 weeks, the prevalence of root surface caries was highest in the av group, but  root caries scores were not significantly different among the three infected groups. in the groups sm and avsm, the molar crowns were extensively destroyed by caries, while in the av group the crowns were almost intact. it was concluded that challenge with actinomyces viscosus may be appropriate to study root surface caries in hamsters.

AB  == we adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (mcclay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. bacteria are centrifuged onto  human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. plates  are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. the force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. the bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (actinomyces viscosus t14 v). these forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately  6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.

TI  == microbiological assessment of an improved stannous fluoride dentifrice.
AB  == recently, a new stabilized stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice (ssf) has been developed. the aim of the present work was to examine the antimicrobial activity  of snf2, and to assess the long-term microbial safety of this dentifrice in a series of in vitro and clinical evaluations. results of in vitro time-kill experiments with representative oral bacteria demonstrated that snf2 exerts broad antimicrobial activity against both gram-positives and gram-negatives and, in particular, has potent activity against streptococcus mutans. sixty-eight subjects participated in a nine-day plaque regrowth clinical study to assess the  short-term antiplaque effect of ssf. the results revealed no significant differences from the negative control, suggesting that snf2 does not detectably or directly alter plaque microbial viability or composition. separately, evaluation of microbial safety in a subgroup of 120 subjects participating in a six-month clinical efficacy and safety trial found no significant ecological shifts between ssf and the negative (naf dentifrice) control among 11 supragingival microbial populations examined. the potential for development of bacterial resistance to snf2 was assessed under both in vitro and clinical conditions. in a rigorous assessment of the ability of bacterial populations to develop either phenotypic or genotypic resistance to snf2, representative bacteria were exposed to continuous sub-lethal concentrations of snf2 in a laboratory chemostat for at least 9 days. results of time-kill experiments on exposed populations revealed no significant changes in susceptibility despite exposure of over 10(12) bacteria. based on typical spontaneous mutation rates of  10(-6) to 10(-8), these results suggested that the potential for bacteria to develop resistance to snf2 is low. evaluation of susceptibility to snf2 to over 800 bacterial isolates obtained over the course of the six-month clinical trial corroborate the in vitro findings, revealing no changes in susceptibility suggestive of development of resistance to snf2 is a microbiologically safe agent for oral use and support separate clinical observations demonstrating the safety  and efficacy of this stabilized snf2 dentifrice.

TI  == adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  == numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. we compared the ability of streptococcus and actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsha) and human saliva (sha). we also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. we show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. dissolved rsha beads revealed a  major protein band (35-49 kd), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kd and alpha-amylase (66 kd) were also identified. overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsha are similar to those observed with sha.

TI  == plaque composition, fluoride tolerance and acid production of mutans streptococci before and after the suspension of the use of fluoride toothpastes.
AB  == although fluoride toothpastes are widely used for caries prevention, little is known about the impact of fluoride dentifrices on plaque composition. also the issue of adaptation of mutans streptococci to grow in vivo in a fluoride environment has received little attention. such an adaptation may be of interest  as it has been suggested that adapted mutans streptococci may show reduced glycolytic activity thereby being less cariogenic. in the present experiments the impact of the suspension of the use of fluoride toothpastes on plaque composition, fluoride tolerance and acid production of mutans streptococci was studied. pooled plaque samples from the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors were collected from individuals (n = 13) just before and 7 weeks after they had replaced their fluoride toothpastes (0.1-0.15% f) with a non-fluoride one. the samples were analysed for fluoride and the numbers and proportions of streptococci, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species,  and lactobacilli, respectively. the fluoride tolerance of the mutans streptococci was estimated by culture of the plaque samples on tycsb agar supplemented with of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mmol/l fluoride (naf) at ph 7.2. from each plaque sample six s. mutans strains were isolated for the measurement of the rate of acid production (vap) at ph 7 in the presence of 0, 5, and 10 mmol/l f. the overnight  final ph was measured in cultures of the s. mutans strains with excess of glucose and 0, 5, and 10 mmol/l f. the results showed that the removal of the fluoride pressure from plaque did not affect the numbers or proportions of the various species and genera of bacteria. the fluoride tolerance of the mutans streptococci, and the vap or the overnight final ph of the isolated strains had not changed. these results suggest that the use of fluoride toothpaste had not affected plaque composition, nor fluoride tolerance or acidogenicity of mutans streptococci. probably the amount of fluoride delivered by fluoride dentifrices to dental plaque is too low to induce such adaptations.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota in plaque covering sound, carious and arrested carious root surfaces.
AB  == the plaque microbiota covering sound or carious root surfaces were studied and compared with that covering arrested root caries lesions. from each of these categories five extracted teeth were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed us to relate the qualitative and quantitative microbial composition to the degree of integrity of the root surface. plaque was sampled by a newly developed 'mowing' technique. plaque samples were cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci of the mutans group. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, api zym, and api 50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. regardless of the state of mineralization, the microbiota on all surfaces resembled marginal plaque associated with gingivitis. in addition to the gram-positive predominant facultative anaerobic genera streptococcus, staphylococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces, gram-negative anaerobes, predominantly bacteroides, prevotella, selenomonas, fusobacterium, leptotrichia,  and capnocytophaga, showed the highest isolation frequencies. on all surfaces actinomyces spp. predominated, with streptococci and lactobacilli forming a minor part of the microbiota. with respect to the detected proportions of anaerobes, microaerophiles, actinomyces naeslundii, prevotella buccae and selenomonas dianae, significant differences were observed between the three categories of root surfaces. the total cfu's on both caries-free and caries-active surfaces were significantly higher than on arrested lesions. in general, the results support a polymicrobial etiology for caries initiation on root surfaces, with a.  naeslundii, capnocytophaga spp., and prevotella spp. making specific contributions to the processes of cementum and dentin breakdown.

AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == comparison of selected microflora of plaque and underlying carious dentine associated with primary root caries lesions.
AB  == the composition of the microflora recovered from superficial dental plaque sampled from 81 primary root caries lesions requiring restoration was compared with the microflora of the underlying, infected carious dentine. the numbers of bacteria in the plaque samples were significantly greater than in the dentine samples, and the frequency of recovery of mutans streptococci, streptococci, lactobacilli, gram-positive pleomorphic rods (primarily actinomyces spp.), and yeasts was not significantly different between the paired samples. however, the proportion of lactobacilli and gram-positive pleomorphic rods was significantly greater in the dentine, while the proportions of streptococci and yeasts did not  differ significantly; the proportions of mutants streptococci were similar in both samples. these data indicate that the microflora overlying primary root caries lesions is significantly different from that associated with the infected  root dentine. the method of sampling and culturing the microflora of root caries  lesions must, therefore, discriminate between the microflora of the superficial supragingival plaque and the microflora associated with destruction of the infected underlying dentine.

'fluoride-bound hydroxyapatite' (fha) and 'fluoride-free hydroxyapatite' (ha) rods were prepared as test and control surfaces, respectively. biofilms of s. mutans bm71, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 wvu627, and l. casei bm225 accumulated on the surfaces of rods in a semi-defined, mucin-based medium in a chemostat. culture conditions were varied from ph 4.5 to 7.0 under carbon (glucose) limitation and excess, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1. low environmental ph reduced both the numbers of cells on ha surfaces during the early phases (from 0 to 2 h) of accumulation and the final numbers of cells in mature biofilms (20 h). the initial adherence of cells was unaffected by surface  fluoride under any of the conditions tested. similarly, biofilm cells under carbon limitation and those under carbon excess at ph 7.0 were not affected by surface fluoride. however, at low environmental ph values, ph 5.5 for s. mutans and ph 6.0 for a. naeslundii under glucose excess, the accumulation of biofilm cells on the fha surfaces was significantly reduced (p < 0.05-0.001). biofilm cell number doubling times of s. mutans and a. naeslundii were increased on fha relative to ha. biofilms of l. casei were not significantly affected, even at ph  4.5 in glucose excess. the results confirmed that fluoride from the substratum affected fluoride-sensitive biofilm cells but only under conditions of glucose excess ad low ph.

TI  == bacterial-protein interactions in the oral cavity.
AB  == bacteria in the oral cavity must interact with salivary proteins if they are to survive. such interactions can take several forms, either providing nutrients, a  means of adhesion to surfaces, or resulting in aggregation or killing and, therefore, clearance of organisms. recent work has provided an insight into the mechanisms of some of these bacterial-protein interactions, revealing complexity  and diversity. for example, the interaction between a putative streptococcus mutans adhesin, p1 (b, i/ii, etc.), and a parotid glycoprotein results in adhesion when it occurs at a surface or aggregation when in solution, and different domains of p1 appear to be involved in the two processes. an alternative strategy is employed by actinomyces viscosus, which interacts, via its type-1 fimbriae, with a proline-rich salivary protein; however, this interaction occurs only when the prp is adsorbed to a surface. a. viscosus takes  advantage of a conformational change in the prp when it becomes surface-bound, which exposes a cryptic part of the molecule. a third, and intriguing, type of interaction is seen between various streptococci and salivary amylase. this does  not result in either adherence or aggregation but provides organisms with the ability to utilize starch breakdown products for metabolism. an understanding of  the mechanisms involved in bacterial-protein interactions could conceivably lead  to novel methods for controlling specific pathogens, but the systems operating in the mouth are numerous, complex, and diverse.

AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an in vitro model for adhesion of bacteria to human tooth root surfaces.
AB  == a model mimicking bacterial colonization of dentine has been developed. it employs uniform particles of pulverized human tooth root tissue incubated with radioactively labelled bacteria. after incubation, the number of attaching bacteria is quantified. attachment of streptococcus mutans ua140, actinomyces viscosus t14, and lactobacillus casei 101 was found to be time dependent and complete within 1-3 h. dissociation constants (kd) of the interactions equalled 2.5 x 10(8) and 1.6 x 10(8) cells/ml, for strep. mutants and a. viscosus, respectively. the kd for l. casei could not be determined as attachment was not saturable. the putative tissue components involved in adherence were studied by determining the attachment of bacteria in the presence of competing strains. the  results suggest that strep. mutans and a. viscosus recognized and competed for the same ligand (probably collagen) in the dentine. l. casei attachment did not complete with the attachment of strep. mutans and a. viscosus. attachment of all  strains was modified by preincubation with saliva and varied with bacterial strain and saliva donor.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate on oral bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether pyrophosphate, the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, exerts antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria commonly found in supragingival plaque. minimal inhibitory concentrations of pyrophosphate were determined for streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces  naeslundii. all of the bacteria tested were susceptible to pyrophosphate with identical minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.67% wt/vol (25 mm). bactericidal kinetics assays revealed that both s. mutans and a. viscosus were killed by pyrophosphate, with the latter being considerably more susceptible. the mechanism of killing was not due to high ionic strength, as comparable controls showed no loss in numbers of viable cells. brief exposure (two 5-min incubations) of s. mutans to pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate caused pronounced inhibition of growth over the 24-h test period. under the constraints of the conditions used, these studies indicate that pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate can substantially inhibit the growth of oral bacteria. these compounds may affect the oral microflora of patients who routinely use tartar-control dentifrices and mouthrinses.

TI  == characteristics of accumulation of oral gram-positive bacteria on mucin-conditioned glass surfaces in a model system.
AB  == strains of streptococcus, actinomyces and lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (ph 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. the accumulation of cells followed four phases. in phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (cdt) streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): cdt streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. the biofilm stabilized in phase 4, cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. the numbers  (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and lactobacillus, 2.77.  accumulation increased (cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  == the treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. to investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. analyses of  sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that s. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. the pattern of recolonization by individual streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: s. oralis and s. sanguis were primary colonizers while s. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. it is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.

TI  == a comparison of primary root caries lesions classified according to colour.
AB  == three hundred and ninety-five primary root caries lesions in 117 patients were included in this study. each lesion was clinically characterised (colour, dimensions, distance from gingival margin and texture) and a sample of infected or altered dentine was taken using a standardised sampling procedure. the relationships between the colour and the microflora, texture, physical dimensions and distance from the gingival margin of the lesions were investigated. lesions in each colour group (light brown, yellow, dark brown and black) were identified  in each texture category (soft, leathery and hard), except for black lesions which were recorded as only soft or leathery. black soft and black leathery lesions had a significantly greater area and harboured more lactobacilli than all other types of lesions while black leathery lesions also harboured significantly  more yeasts. there were no significant differences in the number of bacteria or mutans streptococci isolated from soft or leathery lesions irrespective of lesion colour. overall, these data indicate that the colour of primary root caries lesions is not a reliable indicator of primary root caries activity. assessment of the clinical severity of primary root caries lesions requires consideration of lesion texture and the distance of the lesion from the gingival margin rather than the colour of the lesion.

TI  == a quantitative comparison of selected bacteria in human carious dentine by microscopic counts.
AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

TI  == a microbiological study of recurrent dentinal caries.
AB  == a cross-sectional microbiological study of recurrent (secondary) dentinal caries  was conducted. freshly extracted human teeth containing amalgam restorations judged to be clinically intact were scrubbed with chlorhexidine soap and soaked in povidone-iodine solution. the teeth were then split to remove the fillings and examined for dentinal caries. of 54 teeth examined, 22 (40%) were free of dentinal caries in the restored site. the remainder were assigned to arbitrary groups of questionable (15), initial (8) and active caries (9), based on the amount of dentinal decay observed. comparison of pre-extraction bite-wing radiographs with the in situ findings revealed the sensitivity for secondary caries detection to be only about 50%. in contrast, the specificity for absence of caries was 73%. there was considerable variation in the numbers and types of micro-organisms found in dentine samples from lesions of comparable severity. facultatively, anaerobic streptococci were the most numerous and most prevalent micro-organisms in the affected dentine, but no single species was significantly  associated with recurrent caries. mutans streptococci were found in 40% of sites  with any degree of caries and in only 3 of the 9 sites with the most caries. homofermentative lactobacilli were present in 18 of the 54 dentine samples, including 4 from caries-free sites. while the prevalence and numbers of lactobacilli increased with the degree of caries, they occurred in less than half of the affected dentine samples. actinomyces occurred in 15 of 32 affected sites  but only in 2 of the 9 most active sites. their numbers never exceeded 3 x 10(3)  cfu/mg.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == adhesion of actinomyces isolates to experimental pellicles.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to adhere to surfaces is associated with their pathogenicity. actinomyces can adhere to pellicle and cells through extracellular fimbriae. research on adhesion of actinomyces has been conducted with use of hydroxyapatite (ha) coated with mammalian-derived salivary constituents, whereas  the bacterial-derived components of the acquired pellicle have been largely ignored. the influence of the cell-free bacterial enzyme, glucosyltransferase (gtf), on adhesion of human and rodent isolates of actinomyces viscosus was examined. cell-free gtf was adsorbed onto parotid saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha). next, a. viscosus was exposed to the pellicle following the synthesis of glucan formed in situ by gtf. glucans formed on the pellicle served as binding sites for adhesion of a rodent strain of a. viscosus. conversely, the presence of in situ glucans on sha reduced the adhesion of human isolates of a. viscosus compared with their adhesion to sha. adhesion of the rodent strains may be facilitated through a dextran-binding protein, since the rodent strains aggregated in the presence of dextrans and mutan. the human isolates were not aggregated by dextran or mutan. pellicle harboring a. viscosus rodent strains interfered with the subsequent adhesion of streptococcus mutans to the bacterial-coated pellicle. in contrast, the adhesion of s. mutans to pellicle was not decreased when the pellicle was pre-exposed to a human isolate of a. viscosus. the experimental data suggest that human and the rodent isolates of a.  viscosus have distinct glucan adhesion properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a microbiological study of primary root-caries lesions with different treatment needs.
AB  == samples of altered or carious dentin for microbiological culture were obtained from 301 primary root-caries lesions in 59 patients by means of a standardized sampling procedure. this involved the cleansing of each root surface of extraneous supragingival plaque by means of a hand-held toothbrush and distilled  water and the collection of the sample with a sterile dental excavator passed through the entire vertical dimension of each lesion. the total number of colony-forming units (cfu) in each sample and the numbers of mutans streptococci  (primarily streptococcus mutans), lactobacilli, yeasts, and gram-positive pleomorphic rods (gppr) were determined. individual bacterial counts were expressed as log10 (cfu per sample), as a percentage of the total number of bacteria per sample, and as a frequency of isolation from lesions with different  clinical diagnostic criteria. clinical measurements of each lesion were made for  color, texture, position relative to the gingival margin, and treatment need. lesions classified as soft yielded significantly more bacteria, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and gppr than leathery lesions, which yielded more bacteria than hard lesions. lesions were classified into 5 treatment categories:  soft and restore, leathery and restore, leathery and debride of caries; leathery  and treat therapeutically; and hard no treatment. the total numbers of bacteria,  mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, gppr, and yeasts decreased significantly with  decreasing treatment need. the frequency of isolation of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and yeasts was significantly greater from lesions requiring restoration and from lesions situated within 1 mm of the gingival margin. we suggest that the majority of root caries is initiated adjacent to the gingival margin.

TI  == synergistic, growth-inhibitory effects of chlorhexidine and copper combinations on streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether chlorhexidine combined with copper would exert a synergistic, growth-inhibitory effect against selected  oral bacteria. actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus mutans were all susceptible to chlorhexidine individually, with s. mutans displaying the highest sensitivity. much higher concentrations of copper were needed to achieve growth inhibition of the micro-organisms tested. determination  of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine and cu2+ combinations suggested synergistic activity. bactericidal kinetics assays confirmed synergism of chlorhexidine and cu2+ combinations with 1 to 2 log greater decreases in viable cell numbers compared with chlorhexidine alone. under the constraints of the conditions employed, these data demonstrate the efficacy of chlorhexidine and cu2+ combinations against the oral bacteria tested. these studies suggest that a chlorhexidine and copper formulation could be useful as a  mouthrinse in helping control cariogenic micro-organisms and/or in the treatment  of gingivitis.

(c), tubulicid blue (tb) and red label (tr), blue experimental  solution (sb) and red experimental solution (sr) and sterile distilled water (control). the preparation was incubated at 37 degrees c for seven days to test viability. p, tr, tb and sb produced complete inhibition of germs tested. the results reveal that, "in vitro", not all the substances tested exert a germicide  effect on the microorganisms analyzed.

AB  == in 15 caries-active patients, with a total of 770 exposed root surfaces, the effect of fluoride therapy and professional tooth cleaning was studied during a 1-year period. dental plaque from 92 of the root surfaces and whole saliva samples were analysed at baseline and after 12 months for the presence of specific bacteria. the results showed that the number of active carious lesions had decreased from 99 to 46, while the inactive lesions had increased from 69 to  124. of the active lesions which had been converted into inactive lesions, most were on the buccal and fewest were located on the distal surfaces. lower plaque scores were found on sound and inactive root surfaces compared to active surfaces. the salivary concentrations of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli remained constant during the 12-month observation period. there was a tendency for higher levels of streptococcus mutans in plaque from active lesions compared  with sound root surfaces, whereas an inverse relationship was noted for the streptococcus oralis group. no significant differences in the actinomyces naeslundii counts were detected. in conclusion, the 12-month prophylactic programme had an effect on the clinical surface characteristics of root caries, but the components of the oral microflora selected for study seemed to be relatively unaffected during the observation period.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (snf2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of snf2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). the antibacterial inhibitory effect of various snf2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. intermedius.  when twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent snf2 were compared  for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the snf2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). with increasing concentration of snf2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). snf2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. this in vitro study demonstrated that certain snf2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the snf2.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine-containing gel and varnish on abutment teeth in patients with overdentures.
AB  == previous experiments have shown that daily use of 1% chlorhexidine gel strongly reduced caries development in the abutment teeth under overdentures. the present  experiment was designed to determine whether intermittent application of chlorhexidine, either in a varnish or in a gel, might be used as an alternative preventive method, less demanding for the patient. to this end, 31 patients were  distributed among four treatment groups, with the number of mutans streptococci in plaque and saliva used as a balancing criterion. the treatments consisted of a single application of 40% chlorhexidine varnish, daily application of 1% chlorhexidine gel for one week, or the corresponding placebo treatments with varnish or gel without chlorhexidine. patients were re-called for bacteriological and clinical examination at various intervals during an eight-week period following treatment. chlorhexidine varnish and chlorhexidine gel applications significantly suppressed mutans streptococci on the abutment teeth for four and eight weeks, respectively. in agreement with earlier findings, the numbers of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii in plaque were significantly increased after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. the chlorhexidine gel reduced plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding for one week but had no long-lasting effect. the results seem to justify a long-term clinical test of intermittent chlorhexidine applications as an alternative for daily use in patients with overdentures.

TI  == the influence of denture-wearing and age on the oral microflora.
AB  == the effects of denture-wearing and age on the prevalence of selected bacteria of  dental significance and on the carriage of opportunistic pathogens in molar plaque and whole saliva were determined in 120 healthy subjects, 41 of whom wore  partial dentures. the subjects were divided into four age groups: 20-39 years (group a), 40-59 years (group b), 60-79 years (group c), and greater than or equal to 80 years (group d). the proportions, mean log10 viable counts, and isolation frequency of yeasts and lactobacilli in saliva and plaque were consistently higher in partial-denture wearers. the proportions of staphylococci  and mutans streptococci were also raised in denture wearers, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. when the data were analyzed for age effects, both yeasts and lactobacilli were found to be increased in saliva with age, but statistically significant differences were generally found only between denture wearers in group d and subjects in the control group a. the  isolation frequency of yeasts from plaque was also significantly higher in denture wearers of the oldest age group (d) compared with those in group a. a. viscosus predominated over a. naeslundii in the older age groups, regardless of the presence of dentures. enterobacteria were isolated occasionally but only from the saliva of denture wearers in group d. spirochetes and black-pigmented anaerobes were generally found in lower numbers in denture wearers. collectively, the data show that components of the oral microflora in adults can be independently influenced by both age and the wearing of partial dentures.

TI  == sealing of occlusal hidden caries lesions: an alternative for curative treatment?
AB  == the bacterial composition of the dentine of thirty molars with sealed occlusal surfaces (delton tinted) was examined. undiagnosed hidden caries was present at the time of treatment. although clinically assessed as good (age 3.4 years, s.d.  2.1), 47 percent of the sealants had a marginal defect, when assessed with sem. the dentine of the treated teeth was of a soft consistency. the median of the number of microorganisms was 400 (range 0-3.10(5)) cfu per sample. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were found in 53 percent of the samples. no relationship was found between the number of microorganisms and the marginal adaptation of the sealant, when examined under sem; neither was a relationship found between the age of the sealant and the number of microorganisms (kendall's  tau-c = 0.17, n.s. and -0.01, n.s., respectively). at present, there are insufficient grounds for treating nonvisible lesions (with a radiolucency on the  bitewing) with a resin sealant.

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == bacterial growth of a vegetable oil-based product was determined in vitro. growth of streptococcus mutans and veillonella alcalescens was strongly inhibited for dilutions up to 50x. on the basis of these results, it was decided to evaluate the short-term, clinical efficacy of a 1:10 dilution of the concentrated product  in water. fifteen human volunteers employed this rinse twice-a-day during a six-day period. planimetric plaque scores, as well as the plaque and gingival indexes according to loe, were assessed at the beginning and end of this period.  the efficacy of such a rinse, though less than of chlorhexidine-based products, turned out comparable to several other commercially available products with a reasonable potential in maintaining a low gingival index.

TI  == effect of slow-release chlorhexidine mouthguards on the levels of selected salivary bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the effect of an alternate delivery system for chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms) and other selected oral bacteria.  on the basis of salivary ms levels > or = 10(4) cfu/ml, 22 subjects were enrolled. all caries lesions were restored prior to treatment. two pretreatment paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were obtained for culturing at least 1 week apart. complete-arch vacuum-adapted mouthguards were individually fabricated and  coated internally with a 3% w/v chlorhexidine varnish. mouthguards were worn for  an average of 7 h/night for 7 nights. saliva samples were obtained immediately after treatment and 1 and 3 months later. there was no significant change in levels of any of the monitored bacteria between the two pretreatment samples. a significant and specific reduction in salivary ms levels was observed in the three after-treatment samples as compared with baseline values (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). the levels of actinomyces viscosus were also measured, and there was a significant reduction immediately after treatment (p <  0.05), a return to baseline values at 1 month, and a significant increase above baseline values at 3 months, (p < 0.001). there was no significant change in saliva volume, in total numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria, or in levels of lactobacilli or streptococcus sanguis. this treatment system is capable of significant and specific suppression of ms levels for up to 3 months without retreatment.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

TI  == effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  == surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. a polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. in all bacteria (b. gingivalis, streptococcus sobrinus, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells  adsorbed to the cathode. treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of  cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. moreover, in the case of  b. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. these findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of b. gingivalis was  dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, b. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == effects of an acidic calcium phosphate solution and the intraoral fluoride-releasing device on dental caries and fluoride uptake in rats.
AB  == this investigation comprised two studies evaluating the effects of an acidic calcium phosphate solution (cps) on fluoride uptake in the enamel, glycolysis of  dental plaque, the incidence of dental caries and urinary fluoride concentrations of rats wearing an intraoral fluoride-releasing device (ifrd). in the first study, cps-fluoride treatment preceded the cariogenic challenge. in the second study, the cariogenic challenge preceded the treatments. in the first study, cps  treatments increased the ability of enamel to bind fluoride. however, the enamel-bound fluoride exerted a negligible effect on plaque glycolysis as measured by the ph decrease after sucrose challenge. in the second study cps augmented the caries inhibition for both the sulcal-morsal and buccal-lingual surfaces. in both studies the ifrd significantly restricted the development of carious enamel on the sulcal-morsal surfaces and caused elevated concentrations of fluoride in the urine independent of cps treatments.

AB  == plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. five subject groups were defined: a (dmfs 16.4), b (dmfs 55.9), c1 (dmfs 55.6), c2 (dmfs 57.0) and c3 (dmfs 48.1). groups c1 and c2 had unrestored root surface lesions; group a, b and c3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in groups c1 and c2 than from intact root surfaces in group a. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis 1 and streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from group a. the percentage contribution that s. mutans made to plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 was higher than that from plaque  in group a and actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in group c1 than in samples from group a. the percentage counts of lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 were higher than those from intact roots in groups a, b, and c3. subjects were also grouped on the presence of lactobacillus  and s. mutans in plaque samples. samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of s. mitis 1 and  also a. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing s. mutans or lactobacillus. actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples  containing both s. mutans and lactobacillus. the results confirm an association of s. mutans and lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and a. viscosus serovar 2.

TI  == an intra-oral appliance study of the plaque microflora associated with early enamel demineralization.
AB  == an intra-oral appliance model was used to investigate the composition of the plaque microflora associated with early enamel demineralization. enamel sections, with exposed windows, were mounted on lower removable appliances, and the devices were worn by volunteers for three-week periods under three experimental conditions. these were: (1) "normal" plaque conditions, (2) extra-oral sucrose applications nine times daily, and (3) inoculation of each volunteer's own mutans streptococci onto the test sites and sucrose applications as described for (2). after 21 days, the plaque overlying each window was removed, and the bacterial composition was determined. changes in mineral content of the associated enamel were measured by microradiography and microdensitometry, and the total mineral loss (delta z) that had occurred at each site was calculated. the 144 sites studied were divided into four demineralization groups by delta z value, with an  increase in mineral loss from group 1 to group 4. a progressive and significant increase in the isolation frequency of mutans streptococci occurred from delta z  group 1 to group 4 sites. these organisms were isolated from the plaque of every  location with enamel mineral loss of over 1000 delta z units, but were not detected in 27% of the group 3 sites. lactobacilli comprised 2% to 3% of the total cultivable microflora in groups 1-3 sites, but were found in significantly  higher proportions (18%) at those enamel sites experiencing the most extensive mineral loss (group 4). no significant relationship was found between demineralization and the levels of actinomyces species or veillonella.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  == seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (bsm) and sheep (osm), and from the stomach of pig (pgm). considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. the aggregating activity of hwsm varied widely among the different bacterial strains. the bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for s. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for s. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the s. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. for a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. for a human salivary mucin (mg-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence neuac (alpha 2,3)gal(beta 1,3)galnac- was specifically involved in the interaction with s. sanguis strains, in contrast to s. rattus bht. our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of s. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. on the other hand, desialization of bsm and osm largely abolished their aggregating capability towards s. rattus bht. moreover, it was found that bsm and osm, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effect of a triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice on the oral microflora.
AB  == eighty-one human subjects completed a double-blind study which examined the effects of a 0.3% triclosan/2% gantrez copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice on the microflora of supragingival dental plaque. subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice and a control group which also performed  normal oral hygiene with the same dentifrice minus the triclosan/copolymer. at baseline, 10 weeks, and 28 weeks, supragingival dental plaque was collected from  buccal and lingual surfaces of the four first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase contrast microscopy, 2) actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces species, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and wolinella recta by immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) lactobacillus, yeast, enterics, staphylococcus, aerobes and anaerobes by bacterial culture. after 28 weeks' use of their respective dentifrices, changes in the supragingival plaque microflora of the subjects were similar between the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the control dentifrice group, except for statistically significant reductions in fusiforms, spirochetes and staphylococci and significant increases in s. sanguis in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group, as compared to the control dentifrice group. the subject population was unusual in the presence of enteric species and anaerobes found in supragingival plaque sites. this study indicates that the use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 2% gantrez copolymer over an extended period of time (28 weeks) does not result in shifts in the microflora of supragingival plaque favoring the growth of either opportunistic or pathogenic bacterial species.

TI  == the effects of sucralose on coronal and root-surface caries.
AB  == sucralose is an intensely sweet, chlorinated carbohydrate structurally similar to sucrose; thus, its cariogenic potential is of great interest. four groups of 12 sprague-dawley rats were infected with streptococcus mutans (sobrinus), caged in  a konig-hofer programmed feeding machine, and fed diet 2000 or modified diet to contain sucralose at various concentrations instead of sucrose. rats fed sucralose diet developed significantly fewer lesions than did the rats fed regular diet 2000. animals fed diet 2000 also harbored more s. mutans (sobrinus)  than did the other groups of animals. in a concurrent study, desalivated rats were inoculated with s. mutans (sobrinus) and actinomyces viscosus. they were fed (ad libitum) either diet 2000 (contains 56% sucrose) or diet 2000 minus sucrose plus 93 mg% sucralose. the severity of caries lesions in the sucralose-fed rats after 35 days was significantly less than those in the sucrose-fed rats. the amount of root exposure was the same in both groups. however, root-surface caries did not develop in the sucralose-fed rats. these results show that sucralose is non-cariogenic in rats.

TI  == association of the microbial flora of dental plaque and saliva with human root-surface caries.
AB  == dental plaque was obtained from one or two sound root surfaces of subjects with different degrees of root-surface caries experience. from subjects with root-surface caries, plaque samples were also obtained from either one incipient  or one more advanced lesion. proportions of the total flora were determined for total streptococci and different streptococcal species, total and different actinomyces species, and lactobacilli. a sample of saliva was obtained from about one-third of the subjects for determination of the concentrations of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. the main observations were: (1) subjects without root-surface caries or restorations (group i), as compared with subjects with root-surface caries with or without restorations (group ii), were characterized by having a lower prevalence and proportion of mutans streptococci and a higher prevalence and proportion of a. naeslundii in plaque on sound root surfaces; (2)  subjects in group i also tended to have a lower salivary concentration of mutans  streptococci and lactobacilli than subjects in group ii; (3) dental plaque on sound surfaces in group ii subjects contained a lower proportion of mutans streptococci than plaque associated with incipient or advanced lesions; and (4) the prevalence and proportion of lactobacilli in plaque associated with sound as  well as carious root surfaces were very low. the data reinforce findings from other studies and indicate that, as for coronal caries, the plaque and saliva populations of mutans streptococci specifically are correlated positively with the presence of root-surface caries.

TI  == salivary conditions and cariogenic microorganisms in 55, 65, and 75-year-old swedish individuals.
AB  == secretion rate, buffer capacity, and cariogenic microorganisms of resting and stimulated whole saliva were examined in 208 55-, 65-, and 75-yr-old swedes. the  secretion rate for both resting and stimulated saliva decreased with age. when the use of drugs was taken into account the difference in terms of age group was  significant for resting saliva alone (p less than 0.01). in 22% the resting saliva was less than 0.1 ml/min, and in 5% the stimulated saliva was less than 0.7 ml/min. persons with subjective dryness in the mouth had a lower salivary flow. men had higher secretion rates than women irrespective of medication (p less than 0.05). the buffer capacity was strongly correlated to the secretion rate of both resting and stimulated saliva (r = 0.39 and r = 0.44, respectively). the number of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli increased with age, although significant in terms of age group for lactobacilli alone (p less than 0.05). the  number of these microorganisms was lower in resting saliva than in stimulated saliva (p less than 0.0001). individuals harboring both streptococcus mutans and  streptococcus sobrinus had higher values of mutans streptococci in resting and stimulated saliva than those harboring only s. mutans (p less than 0.001). actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii comprised greater than or equal to 1% of the total cfu in 89% of the plaque samples. the corresponding figures for lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were 6% and 38%, respectively.

TI  == adherence of mutans streptococci to other oral bacteria.
AB  == adherence of mutans streptococci to strains of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane was measured. strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and s. rattus bound in a lactose-independent manner to a variety of the actinomyces and  streptococci. most of these reactions could proceed in the presence of whole saliva although adherence of s. rattus bht to the streptococci was inhibited by salivary molecules. in contrast, adherence of s. mutans 10449 and kpsk2 to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, and s. mitis was enhanced by salivary molecules. s. mutans  kpsk2, s. sobrinus omz 176, and s. rattus fa-1 binding to a. viscosus nc3 and s.  sanguis g9b exhibited saturation kinetics. adherence to a. viscosus nc3 was of a  higher avidity than adherence to s. sanguis g9b. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to s. sanguis g9b and of s. mutans omz 176 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis g9b was inhibited by heat treatment of the mutans streptococci. attachment of s. mutans kpsk2 to a. viscosus nc3 and of s. rattus fa-1 to a. viscosus nc3 and s. sanguis  g9b was unaffected by heat. these observations suggest that the mutans streptococci can adhere to a variety of early plaque bacteria by several distinct mechanisms. such interactions may be important in the colonization of tooth surfaces by the mutans streptococci.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

TI  == effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius.
AB  == the effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius was investigated. b. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a ph as low as 5.0. these bacteria grew almost as well as streptococcus mutans at ph 5.0 and  better than actinomyces viscosus at ph 5.5 and 5.0. some b. intermedius strains raised the culture ph when grown at a low ph without glucose. in contrast, p. gingivalis strains grew only at ph 6.5 to 7.0. the p. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the b. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. b. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at ph 7.0, and high activity over a wide ph range. in contrast, the optimum ph of proteolytic activity in p. gingivalis was ph 7.5 to 8.0. the p. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of b. intermedius to low ph. the capacity of b. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low ph might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. these differences between b. intermedius and p. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how b. intermedius might positively influence the growth of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.

TI  == microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  == studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on streptococcus mutans, and s. mutans and lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. subsequent studies confirmed an association between s. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state  of the lesion. a second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, lactobacillus, and veillonella. however, it has been known for 17 years that the actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii. such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. a similar situation exists with oral streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain s. mutans and lactobacillus show a high isolation of s. mitis 1 and no isolations of a. naeslundii. careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.

TI  == diminished acid tolerance of plaque bacteria caused by fluoride.
AB  == fluoride acts to reduce acid tolerances of plaque bacteria by upsetting normal proton currents across cell membranes. streptococcus mutans was found to be unusually sensitive to fluoride, in part because its f1f0, proton-translocating atpase is directly inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels. thus, not only does fluoride serve in the hf form to bring extruded protons back into the cell, but it also reduces the capacity of the cell to extrude protons. reductions in acid tolerance caused by fluoride would be expected to result in concomitant reductions in cariogenic potential.

AB  == this paper reveals the antibody titer of plaque microorganisms in experimental gingivitis rats of differents ages and immunization. before sacrificing experimental animals status of gingival tissue was assessed. further on speciments of saliva and serum were taken for antibody titer measurements. none of the young rats developed gingivitis during experiment, where as the adult immunized rats bled on probing. low values of antibodys point out the absence of  intensive synthesis of specific antibodys in saliva upon the antigen stimulation  of plaque maicroorganisms. serum antibody titers were low in young rats, moderate in adult, and high in adult immunized rats. these results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigents than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.

TI  == [evaluation of in vitro adhesion of cariogenic microorganisms to enamel and dental filling materials].
AB  == the adhesive ability of lactobacillus, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus-naeslundii on enamel, amalgam and composite of microparticle and small-particle are studied "in vitro". the selective mediums used for the three micro-organisms are, respectively, rogosa agar, m.s.b. and c.f.a.t. the lower adherence is showed by bacterias of lactobacillus genus. s. mutans and a. viscosus-naeslundii show similar adherence properties between them. the greatest  adherence was obtained in composites, being s. mutans the bacteria with a greatest level of adherence to the composites of small-particle, and a. viscosus-naeslundii the bacteria with more adherence to the ones of micro-particle. the adherence on amalgam was slightly lower than the adherence on enamel.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == effects of varnishes containing chlorhexidine on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  == this study describes the effects of varnishes containing 0%, 10%, 20%, or 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on the microflora of human fissure dental plaque. sandarac, a natural resin, was used as the varnish base. ten subjects, each with  at least four sound fissures harboring high levels of streptococcus mutans, participated in the study. the fissures in each of the individuals were randomly  assigned to four experimental groups, in each of which one of the varnishes was tested. the varnish treatment consisted of a single application of a small amount of varnish onto the fissures. apart from the selected fissures, the rest of the dentition was left untreated. all chlorhexidine-containing varnishes selectively  suppressed s. mutans in fissure plaque, and had no effect on total viable counts  or on the numbers of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis beyond one week. the extent of the suppression depended upon the concentration of chlorhexidine in the varnish, 40% chlorhexidine varnish giving the greatest suppression of s. mutans. at 22 weeks, after a single treatment with varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine, mean s. mutans counts were more than ten times lower than in the control or 10%-chlorhexidine varnish group. at that time, s. mutans was still undetectable in five out of ten experimental fissures in this group. the results suggested that sandarac varnishes containing high concentrations of chlorhexidine can be used successfully for long-term suppression of s. mutans in dental fissures.

TI  == the microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  == thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. the teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus species, and veillonella. after plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the royal dental college (copenhagen) for histological analysis. the results showed that s. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. s. sanguis and 's. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and veillonella was isolated from all samples. a.  viscosus was the most commonly isolated actinomyces. the numbers of streptococcus and veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). s. mutans and a. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at  day 1 (p less than 0.01). histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. dissolution was detected in areas where s. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but s. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). there was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of s. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of s. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == caries on root surfaces exposed following gingivectomy in conventional rats infected with streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == to study the ability of bacteria associated with coronal caries to initiate root  surface caries, a rat model was used. root surfaces were exposed by gingivectomy  in rats fed a caries-promoting diet and orally inoculated with either actinomyces viscosus m-100, streptococcus sobrinus (mutans) 6715, or both. a fourth group received a diet containing antibiotics. the animals were sacrificed 64 days following the gingivectomy performed on the right molar quadrants. gingivectomy significantly increased exposed lingual root length and root caries incidence. there were no caries on non-gingivectomy root surfaces. root surface caries incidence in the groups inoculated with a. viscosus and a. viscosus plus s. sobrinus did not differ. for both these groups, root caries incidence was significantly greater than that for the group inoculated with s. sobrinus alone.  root caries incidence in this latter group did not differ from that in the control group.

TI  == an in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  == the difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. this investigation assessed the antibacterial  and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. the microorganisms used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary  organisms, and candida albicans. the results showed an absence of activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. it is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.

TI  == characterization of salivary alpha-amylase binding to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major salivary components which interact with oral bacteria and to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for their binding to the bacterial surface. strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and actinomyces viscosus were incubated for 2 h in freshly collected human submandibular-sublingual saliva (hsmsl) or parotid saliva (hps), and bound salivary components were eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western transfer, alpha-amylase (ec 3.2.1.1) was the prominent salivary component eluted from s. sanguis. studies with 125i-labeled hsmsl or 125i-labeled hps also demonstrated a component with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of alpha-amylase which bound to s. sanguis. purified alpha-amylase from human parotid saliva was radiolabeled and found to bind to strains of s. sanguis genotypes 1 and 3 and s. mitis genotype 2, but not to strains of other species of oral bacteria. binding of [125i]alpha-amylase to streptococci was saturable, calcium independent, and inhibitable by excess unlabeled alpha-amylases from a variety of sources, but not by secretory immunoglobulin a and the proline-rich glycoprotein from hps. reduced and alkylated alpha-amylase lost enzymatic and bacterial binding activities. binding  was inhibited by incubation with maltotriose, maltooligosaccharides, limit dextrins, and starch.

TI  == a microbiological study of early caries of approximal surfaces in schoolchildren.
AB  == a cross-sectional epidemiological study has been undertaken to relate the bacterial composition of approximal dental plaque with the earliest stages of caries development in schoolchildren. small samples of plaque were removed from multiple sites around the contact areas of 42 premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons from 29 schoolchildren (mean age = 13.5 yr). caries diagnosis was based on polarized light microscopy and contact microradiography of thin sections cut through the sample sites. fifty-seven percent of sites (37/60) showed histological evidence of demineralization. both the isolation frequency and the mean percentage viable count of mutans streptococci and actinomyces viscosus were higher at sites with early caries, although mutans streptococci could not be detected at 37% of sites with early caries. at these latter sites, the proportions of veillonella were markedly reduced. lactobacilli were rarely isolated and were never recovered from caries-free surfaces. analysis of the data shows that the relationship between plaque bacteria and enamel is neither merely  passive nor indifferent, and that particular stages of lesion formation may be associated with different combinations of bacteria.

TI  == fast elisa for measuring serum antibody responses.
AB  == a method which speeds up the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) is described. the procedure uses a modified falcon fast assay screening system (becton dickinson labware, lincoln park, nj) and falcon round-bottom 96-well plates. antigen is adsorbed onto beads which extend from a lid and fit into 96-well plates. the beads are washed in a trough and reacted to antibody in the round-bottom plate. the labor required to wash the plates after coating with antigen, antibody or conjugate is thereby reduced. greater flexibility and accuracy result, especially with the use of more than one 96-well plate. in this  study, naturally occurring human igg antibody responses to two isolated bacterial antigens were measured in over 200 subjects. it was found that numerical taxonomy could be used to split out the high igg responders. the igm response to one of the antigens was less variable and not significantly related to the igg response. the fast elisa is as useful to operate as the standard elisa, but less stressful  on the operator and more rapid.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to oral tissues: a model for infectious diseases.
AB  == the majority of bacteria which colonize humans display sharp host and tissue tropisms; consequently, relatively little is known about how they initiate colonization on mucosal surfaces. the mouth has a variety of features which have  enabled it to serve as a useful model for the discovery of basic principles of host-parasite interactions occurring in mucosal environments. early studies demonstrated that indigenous bacteria attach to surfaces of the mouth in a highly selective manner; attachment was often observed to correlate with colonization. these studies led to the recognition that bacterial attachment is an essential step for colonization in environments which contain surfaces exposed to a fluid flow. bacterial adhesion has subsequently grown into a major area of infectious disease research. many bacteria have been found to possess proteinaceous components, called "adhesins", on their surfaces which bind in a stereochemically specific manner to complementary molecules, or "receptors", on the tissue surface. adhesins are often lectins which bind to saccharide receptors, but some  adhesins are thought to bind to proteinaceous receptors. studies of components of human saliva, which adsorb to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces similar to those of teeth, and promote the attachment of prominent plaque bacteria, have revealed that the acidic proline-rich proteins (prps) promote the attachment of several important bacteria. these include strains of actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides gingivalis, some strains of streptococcus mutans, and others. the salivary prp's  are a unique family of molecules. however, segments of prps are structurally related to collagen. this may be significant, since b. gingivalis and certain cariogenic streptococci bind to collagenous substrata, and such interactions may  facilitate their invasion into gingival tissues, or into dentin or cementum, respectively. another unexpected observation was that although a. viscosus and other bacteria bind avidly to prps adsorbed onto apatitic surfaces, they do not interact with prps in solution. prp molecules evidently undergo a conformational  change when they adsorb to ha, and adhesins of a. viscosus recognize cryptic segments which are only exposed in adsorbed molecules. this provides the bacteria with a mechanism for efficiently attaching to teeth while suspended in saliva. it also offers a molecular explanation for their sharp tropisms for human teeth. it  has proven convenient to refer to such hidden receptors for bacterial adhesins as "cryptitopes" (from cryptic, meaning hidden, and topo, meaning place).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == aggregation of 27 oral bacteria by human whole saliva. influence of culture medium, calcium, and bacterial cell concentration, and interference by autoaggregation.
AB  == twenty-seven oral strains of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (19) were tested for aggregation by human whole saliva, as well as  the effect of culture medium, ca-ions, and bacteria concentration thereupon. of the media tested, gf-broth gave rise to less interference by autoaggregation or higher aggregation titers than bhi and tsb, and was used throughout this study. in most cases, ca-ions (1 mm) only enhanced the rate of induced aggregation, whereas raising the bacteria concentration increased the rate of both induced- and autoaggregation. the final titers, ranging from 1-64, were hardly affected by these parameters, except those of s. rattus hg 59 and s. mutans hg 199, which were respectively increased and decreased by ca-ions. saliva-induced aggregation  was observed for 21 strains of a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, s. cricetus, s. mutans, s. rattus, s. sanguis, and s. sobrinus, mostly within 15 min to 3 h. seventeen of these strains also showed autoaggregation, usually well after the onset of induced aggregation. any potential induced aggregation of b. gingivalis hg 91 was always masked by autoaggregation, as well as that of the s. mutans strains under a particular set  of conditions. the aggregation rate and titer varied considerably in a mutually unrelated and strain-dependent way. these microtiterplate data were matched by the 5 spectrophotometric patterns observed for saliva-bacterial interaction, which moreover, gave the better differentiation between induced and autoaggregation. in conclusion, most strains tested can show rapid saliva-induced aggregation in a strain-dependent way, yet strongly affected by the experimental  conditions and interference from autoaggregation.

TI  == effects of sustained-release chlorhexidine acetate on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effect on the human dental plaque flora of a varnish containing chlorhexidine diacetate. the in vitro release of chlorhexidine acetate from the varnish preparation was relatively fast on the first day, followed by a substantial decline in the subsequent three days. in a clinical experiment, 26 volunteers were randomly distributed over four experimental groups. after a dental prophylaxis, the subjects were treated with a single application of a placebo varnish (group i), a fluoride varnish (group ii), a chlorhexidine varnish (group iii), or a fluoride-plus-chlorhexidine varnish (group iv). saliva and pooled plaque samples from approximal surfaces were taken  before (baseline) and one, two, three, four, and six weeks after the treatments.  no suppression was found of total cultivable flora or s. sanguis after the experimental treatments. application of the fluoride varnish did not suppress the a. viscosus/naeslundii or s. mutans levels in the dental plaque. chlorhexidine suppressed a. viscosus/naeslundii until two weeks after the treatment. s. mutans  was significantly suppressed until four weeks after a single chlorhexidine application. while in some subjects s. mutans was effectively suppressed over the whole experimental period, in others s. mutans recovered quickly. in five subjects in whom s. mutans recovered quickly, the dentition was treated twice with chlorhexidine varnish, with an interval of one week between the treatments.  after two chlorhexidine treatments, s. mutans in saliva and on the teeth was suppressed more strongly than after a single treatment. however, the second chlorhexidine treatment could not prevent the return of s. mutans in the approximal areas to its original level.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

TI  == cariological assessment of leucrose [d-glucopyranosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] as a sugar substitute.
AB  == leucrose [d-glucosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] prepared by microbial-enzymatic transglycosidation from sucrose, is the first alpha(1----5)-linked disaccharide which possesses excellent nutritional properties with regard to metabolic utilization and is well tolerated. the aim of the present work was to assess its cariogenic potential. yeast invertase was shown to be inhibited by leucrose in a noncompetitive way, while hydrogenated leucrose (leucritol) acted as an activator. plaque polysaccharide forming glucosyltransferases from streptococcus cricetus aht were not influenced by leucrose, but by leucritol. essentially no acid formation was observed after incubation of leucrose with suspensions of human dental plaque, s. mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus casei lsb 132 and actinomyces viscosus ny 1 no. 30. leucrose was a competitive inhibitor of the acid formation from sucrose by s. mutans nctc  10449 at neutral ph. furthermore, leucrose inhibited at neutral ph considerably the uptake of sucrose by s. mutans nctc 10449. the uptake of fructose and maltose was also inhibited but that of glucose not at all. in cara rats as the animal model, leucrose was compared to sucrose and to corn starch for its cariogenic potential. in sharp contrast to the group fed with 30% sucrose, caries scores of  the 30% leucrose group were not significantly different from the starch group. ph telemetry with an indwelling electrode in man proved lueucrose to be 'safe for teeth' since plaque ph did not drop below ph 5.7. leucrose is a novel noncariogenic disaccharide and thus represents a highly promising sugar substitute for caries prevention.

AB  == physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion  to intact dental tissue slabs. in addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, a. viscosus, and a. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mj.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in  the physiological buffer. the surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased  upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. the adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was  lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some  bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.

TI  == specific and nonspecific inhibition of adhesion of oral actinomyces and streptococci to erythrocytes and polystyrene by caseinoglycopeptide derivatives.
AB  == various caseinoglycopeptide derivatives prepared from mammalian milk were evaluated as inhibitors of hemagglutinations mediated by actinomyces viscosus ny1, streptococcus sanguis omz9, and, for comparative purposes, plant lectins from arachis hypogaea and bauhinia purpurea. it was found that recognition of the beta-d-galactose-(1----3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactose carbohydrate chain by actinomyces viscosus ny1 organisms and arachis hypogaea and b. purpurea agglutinins had similar structural requirements; in all cases, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide, on which several units of the above mentioned disaccharide are clustered, behaved as the most potent hemagglutination inhibitor. by contrast, none of the preparations tested inhibited erythrocyte agglutination by s. sanguis omz9. thus, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of oral actinomyces adhesion to cell membranes (a soft surface) and could be used as a probe for the study of recognition mechanisms mediated by actinomyces galactose-binding lectins. during the present study, both native and desialylated variants of the same bovine glycomacropeptide also totally prevented the adhesion of actinomyces viscosus ny1, s. sanguis omz9, and s. mutans omz176 to polystyrene surfaces. comparative evaluations of various structurally different compounds gave the following results. neither mono- nor disaccharides related to caseinoglycopeptide carbohydrates prevented adhesion; highly positively or negatively charged polypeptides and polysaccharides were either not or only moderately active. besides these glycomacropeptides, an inhibitory activity was also exhibited by other mucin-type glycoproteins carrying short o-linked carbohydrate chains (including bovine submaxillary mucin), polyethylene glycol, and bovine serum albumin. consequently, caseinoglycopeptide prevention of oral bacterial adhesion to polystyrene tubes (a hard surface) takes place with no species specificity and can be compared to nonspecific inhibition exhibited by various polymers with very different structural characteristics.

AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == gallotannins inhibit growth, water-insoluble glucan synthesis, and aggregation of mutans streptococci.
AB  == during screening for anti-plaque agents of plant origin, ethanolic extracts from  melaphis chinensis (bell), the chinese nutgall, exhibited strong inhibition of glucosyltransferase (gtf), in vitro adherence and glucan-induced agglutination of streptococcus mutans 3209 and s. sobrinus b13. more than 91% inhibition of water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by gtf was noted at a concentration as low as 7.8 micrograms/ml. bactericidal effects on other mutans streptococci, s. salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus were also evident. through chemical fractionation and analyses, along with bioassays, the active components were identified as gallotannins.

TI  == the effect of desalivation on coronal and root surface caries in rats.
AB  == although the presence of coronal caries is declining in much of the western hemisphere, the prevalence of root surface caries is likely to increase as teeth  are retained longer than heretofore. at the same time, an increasing number of the population suffer from dry mouth as a result of taking prescription drugs, with an apparent concomitant increased susceptibility to root surface caries. this study attempted to develop an animal model which would aid in the exploration of the effects of desalivation and the development of root surface caries. animals were desalivated, infected with actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans (sobrinus) 6715, and fed a cariogenic diet. coronal caries developed rapidly in the animals; sufficient disease was present after two weeks  to permit evaluation of potential therapeutic agents. alveolar bone loss and root surface lesions developed in three to four weeks. s. mutans (sobrinus) and a. viscosus established readily in all animals; however, as the investigation progressed, populations of the latter declined, possibly because of the highly acidogenic environment. this model will facilitate investigation of the influence of hyposalivation and help in the exploration of agents to alleviate the adverse  effects of salivary gland dysfunction.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == microbial caries induction in the roots of human teeth in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans gs5, lactobacillus casei dsm20011 and actinomyces viscosus t14 produce artificial caries in the roots of extracted teeth. roots were coated  with wax leaving an 8 mm2 window exposed on the buccal surfaces, and then incubated for 8 days in the presence of the test organism, the synthetic medium being changed each day. samples were then examined by sem, or microradiographs were obtained from 120 microns sections. the ph at the root surface at the end of the induction averaged 4.43, 5.00 and 5.20, and the lesion depths measured on the microradiographs averaged 121, 83 and 34 microns, for strep. mutans, l. casei and a. viscosus respectively. this relationship between ph and lesion depth confirms  earlier findings. as all of these organisms can produce lesions in tooth structure, elimination of one type would probably not eliminate caries.

TI  == effects of various organic compounds and fluoride on dental plaque and caries in  rats.
AB  == this investigation measured the effect of several organic compounds on dental caries and plaque when used as oral rinses in rats. these compounds were equimolar with regard to their chloride or fluoride moieties or the added sodium  fluoride (0.26 m f). test agents were dissolved in an aqueous glycerol vehicle and applied daily to the teeth of rats. significant restriction in the mean incidence of dental caries (greater than or equal to 20%) was imparted by the following chemicals used alone or in combination: alexidine dihydrochloride, alexidine dihydrochloride with sodium fluoride, lysine phosphate fluoride, silane polyamine fluoride, tiodonium chloride, and tiodonium chloride with sodium fluoride. only the groups treated with alexidine chloride alone or in combination with sodium fluoride exhibited significantly less dental plaque (greater than or  equal to 64%) than the rats in the placebo-treated groups.

TI  == intergeneric bacterial coaggregations involving mutans streptococci and oral actinomyces.
AB  == mutans streptococci (ms) representing eight different serotypes were tested for their ability to coaggregate in vitro with oral actinomyces and other streptococcal species. of the mutans streptococci tested, only strains of s. cricetus (formerly s. mutans serotype a) displayed pronounced coaggregations and  only with certain strains of actinomyces. s. cricetus coaggregated, by lactose nonreversible mechanisms, with serotype 4 actinomyces naeslundii wvu963 and wvu924 and with serotype 2 actinomyces odontolyticus wvu758. the first pair was disaggregated by protein denaturants (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea) and  edta. this coaggregation was inhibited when the streptococcal, but not the actinomyces, partner was pretreated with either heat or protease, suggesting the  presence of a protein mediator on only the streptococcal cell surface. the s. cricetus-a. odontolyticus coaggregation appeared to involve protein components on each cell, as shown by the lack of coaggregation after pretreatment of either cell type with heat or proteases. this coaggregation was also reversed by sodium  dodecyl sulfate and urea, as well as by sodium deoxycholate, but not by edta. the data indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in each of these coaggregations.

AB  == we studied the effect of oral infection with cariogenic micro-organisms on alveolar bone loss and root surface caries subsequent to gingivectomy in rats. thirty-six rats were fed diet mit 200 (67% sucrose); one-half, the controls, had  antibiotics added to the diet. at ages 18, 19, and 21 days, the experimental group was orally infected with streptomycin-resistant streptococcus sobrinus (mutans) 6715 and actinomyces viscosus m-100. at age 30 days, all animals were subjected to a gingivectomy on maxillary and mandibular left quadrants. the experimental group was re-inoculated at age 36 days. animals were killed seven weeks after surgery. jaws were stained, and planimetric measurements of exposed root surface area and caries on lingual/palatal surfaces of 1st and 2nd molars were made from video images with a computer/digitizer. compared with the non-operated contralateral quadrants, gingivectomy significantly increased exposed root surface area in the maxilla and in the mandible in both the control  and experimental groups. oral inoculation significantly increased exposed root surface in mandibular (but not maxillary) quadrants which had received a gingivectomy, but had no effect on non-gingivectomized quadrants. there was no caries in the control group, whereas ten rats in the experimental group had root  surface caries lesions, all in quadrants which had received a gingivectomy. this  rat model should prove useful in further studies of root surface caries.

TI  == microbial aspects of preventive regimes in patients with overdentures.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test effects of preventive regimes using fluoride and chlorhexidine to prevent caries and periodontal diseases in 34 patients with  overdentures. the patients, who were treated with immediate overdentures, were distributed at random into three experimental groups. in these groups, different  gels--a placebo, a fluoride, and a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel--were tested by daily application. supragingival plaque samples from selected surfaces of two abutment teeth were taken at one week, and at one, three, and six months after initial insertion of the overdenture. the placebo and fluoride gel influenced neither total cfu nor s. sanguis and a. viscosus/naeslundii counts. in the placebo group, but not in the fluoride group, s. mutans levels increased significantly, indicating the caries risk involved in overdentures. the use of chlorhexidine-fluoride gel resulted in a long-term suppression of total cfu. further, s. mutans was found to be selectively suppressed to below detection level. a. viscosus/naeslundii was initially strongly suppressed, but after three  months a partial return of the population was noticed. s. sanguis was relatively  insensitive to the chlorhexidine-fluoride gel. it is concluded that a daily application of a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel is effective against plaque formation and s. mutans on abutment teeth in overdentures.

TI  == relationship between dental plaque indices and bacteria in dental plaque and those in saliva.
AB  == a variety of indices has been developed for the quantitation of dental plaque. the aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the loe plaque index and the number of bacteria on the same tooth. furthermore, the effect of plaque accumulation on the salivary counts of some dental plaque organisms was estimated. twenty volunteers were asked to abstain from all oral hygiene for a one-week period. clinical indices and bacteriological samples were taken at the start and at the end of the experimental period. after an interval of seven days, the experiment was repeated. the relationship between the loe plaque index and the total bacterial counts on the same area of the tooth was found to be highly significant. after seven days without oral hygiene, the total counts and the actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis counts in dental plaque had increased by approximately two log units, while the streptococcus mutans counts had increased by more than one log unit. the large increase in the number  of bacteria on the teeth was reflected in the salivary counts of the actinomyces  species, but not in the s. sanguis or s. mutans counts. this was due to differences in ecological habitats of these species in the mouth. highly significant correlations were found between the s. mutans level in dental plaque  and the salivary level, and between the s. mutans counts of the subjects in the first and second trials of the experiment.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == the effects of cheese snacks on caries in desalivated rats.
AB  == rats that had had their submandibular/sublingual glands removed surgically, and their parotid ducts tied, developed fewer and less severe caries lesions on coronal and root surfaces when fed cheese snacks in addition to a cariogenic diet than when fed additional cariogenic snacks or no additional snacks. the effects of cheese snacks were particularly dramatic on root-surface caries. these observations may be relevant for elderly humans who are most likely to develop root surface caries. populations of streptococcus mutans did not differ among the groups. actinomyces viscosus was not detected at the end of the experiment in any of the groups. the results of this study demonstrate that cheese exerts a protective effect against coronal and root-surface caries in rats with a severely limited salivary function.

TI  == structural determinants of activity of chlorhexidine and alkyl bisbiguanides against the human oral flora.
AB  == we assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative as well as the gram-positive oral bacteria. the alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane)  and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against fusobacterium nucleatum, also  associated with periodontal disease. seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against actinomyces species. all test agents were active against streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == metabolism of glycosylsucrose by oral microorganisms and its hydrolysis by streptococcus salivarius fructosyltransferase.
AB  == resting-cell suspensions of oral microorganisms grown in sucrose were studied for the production of acid from glucosylsucrose and maltosylsucrose. most oral microorganisms fermented these sugars to only a limited extent. streptococcus salivarius, however, metabolized glucosylsucrose as well as sucrose. we therefore looked for a specific enzyme in s. salivarius which was capable of hydrolyzing glucosylsucrose. fructosyltransferase and invertase were purified from s. salivarius 13419, and the substrate specificities and hydrolytic activities of these enzymes were determined. purified fructosyltransferase catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose, whereas purified invertase barely hydrolyzed these sugars. these results suggest that the high fermentative  efficiency of glycosylsucrose by s. salivarius is due to the hydrolysis of these  sugars by fructosyltransferase, but not by invertase. the partially purified fructosyltransferases of actinomyces viscosus ny1 and streptococcus mutans ncib 11723 catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose. the fructosyltransferases of these oral microorganisms are also responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosylsucrose.

TI  == in vitro caries-like lesion production by streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus using sucrose and starch.
AB  == we investigated the formation of caries-like lesions on root and enamel sections  by s. mutans and a. viscosus when grown in four different carbohydrate substrates. the substrates were: sucrose, starch + alpha-amylase, and a combination of starch and sucrose with and without alpha-amylase. twenty-four sections with exposed windows on both the root and enamel surfaces were exposed to the individual bacterial species in each of the four substrates for three weeks. at three weeks, the sections were removed and lesion depths measured. when grown in sucrose alone, s. mutans produced significantly deeper lesions in both root and enamel surfaces when compared with a. viscosus. however, s. mutans failed to produce lesions when grown in "limited" sucrose with starch added, whereas a. viscosus in this same substrate produced lesions in the enamel and root surfaces. a viscosus also produced either similar or significantly deeper lesions in both root and enamel surfaces, when compared with s. mutans grown in the two substrates with amylase. thus, under these in vitro conditions, it was demonstrated that a. viscosus could utilize starch, whereas utilization of starch by s. mutans was alpha-amylase-dependent.

AB  == human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b,  c, d, and e and strains of lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis. the desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.8) containing 0.154  m sodium chloride. after another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. the l. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. however, all strains, including the nonagglutinating l. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. the agglutinin extracts from s. mutans serotype c, s. sanguis, and a. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. the purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. all agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that  was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. this type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.

TI  == estimation of growth parameters for some oral bacteria grown in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions.
AB  == the coexistence of bacteria in natural environments can often be explained in terms of competition for a growth-limiting substrate(s), and the outcome of such  competition depends upon relevant growth parameters such as substrate affinity and yield. dental plaque bacteria are frequently carbon and energy limited. growth parameters for seven oral streptococcus species and one actinomyces viscosus strain were estimated under glucose-limited conditions in continuous culture. in all strains, mixed-acid fermentation occurred at low growth rates, while amounts of lactate increased at higher growth rates. two important growth parameters, mumax and y glucose, were very similar in the two serotype c streptococcus mutans strains (t8 and ingbritt), one of the serotype d/g streptococcus mutans strains (omz65), and the two streptococcus milleri strains (699b3 and b448). two other serotype d/g s. mutans strains (kir and b13) were divergent from this group and had lower mumax values and a lower y glucose. the maintenance energy coefficients were lower in the s. mutans serotype c strains, and the highest values were observed in the s. milleri strains. while a. viscosus had a lower mumax, its lower maintenance rate and significantly higher yield indicate that it deals much more efficiently with glucose than do the streptococci. the most striking feature of amino acid utilization was that arginine was completely consumed by s. milleri strains; similarly, a. viscosus used up all available asparagine as did one of the s. milleri strains at faster growth rates. it is suggested that the ability of strains of s. milleri and s. sanguis to utilize arginine in addition to carbohydrate as a source of energy may explain why such organisms increase in proportion in the plaque of subjects consuming diets almost devoid of fermentable carbohydrate.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

AB  == a series of 22 5-(alkylsulfonyl)salicylanilides was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial and antiplaque activity against actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans, adherent microorganisms implicated in periodontal disease and dental caries. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 25 salicylanilides (including 5-acyl-, 5-alkyl-, and 5-(alkylsulfonyl)-4'-bromo- and -4'-(trifluoromethyl)salicylanilides) were found to correlate (r = 0.94) with estimated log d values. several salicylanilides, such as 5-(decylsulfonyl)- and 5-(dodecylsulfonyl)-4'-(trifluoromethyl)salicylanilides (15 and 19) were found to exhibit high levels of in vitro antibacterial and antiplaque activity against a.  viscosus and s. mutans.

TI  == the growth of bacteria and the production of exoglycosidic enzymes in the dental  plaque of macaque monkeys.
AB  == the rate of growth of the predominant bacterial strains of plaque from the developmental grooves of first deciduous molar teeth was determined. median doubling times were 3.32, 3.45, 2.88 and 4.54 h for streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and neisseria mucosa respectively. withdrawal of dietary food did not greatly influence the number of bacteria found in the grooves 18 h after they had been cleaned when compared to the number in fed monkeys; exceptions were significant increases in streptococcus mitior and n. mucosa. addition of 0.5 per  cent (w/v) glucose to the drinking water of fasted monkeys also did not influence the size of this bacterial population 18 h after cleaning, so bacteria growing in cleaned grooves must gain a major part of their nutritional needs from their immediate environment, most likely salivary constituents. the ability of oral bacteria to use the oligosaccharide side-chains of salivary glycoproteins was then explored. exoglycosidases for the preferred anomeric linkages of the principal monosaccharide units of salivary glycoproteins were produced both by oral bacteria in vitro and by dental plaque in vivo. thus plaque flora has the potential to degrade glycoproteins and this may explain how bacteria in the grooves grow in the absence of dietary food.

TI  == metabolic differences between saliva from caries-active and caries- and restoration-free children.
AB  == sucrose consumption and lactic-acid production by saliva, and the effects of ph,  were first evaluated by radio-isotope techniques in populations of caries- and restoration-free (cf), and caries-active from sucrose than saliva from ca subjects. sucrose consumption also was significantly greater in saliva of cf subjects. these results occurred at ph 7.2 but not at ph 6.0 and 5.0. lactic acid, total volatile products and carbon-dioxide (co2) production by saliva were  then evaluated in different cf and ca populations of children. metabolic parameters in the presence and absence of salivary supernatant (ss) also were determined. saliva of these cf subjects also formed significantly more lactic acid from sucrose than did ca subjects. the presence of ss increased lactic-acid  formation in this saliva; the increase was significant in cf subjects. total volatile products and co2 were greater in saliva of cf subjects but were not affected by ss. partial microbial characterization of each salivary specimen was  conducted in both series of experiments. cf subjects harboured less streptococcus mutans (parts i and ii), total lactobacilli (parts i and ii) and actinomyces species (part ii) than ca subjects. differences for lactobacilli in the first population and actinomyces species in the second were significant.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == enamel demineralization by acid produced from endogenous substrate in oral streptococci.
AB  == bovine enamel blocks were covered by a bacterial cell mass and held in the mouths of human volunteers by a palatal appliance, to study the effects of acid production from endogenous bacterial substrate on the ph of the mass and on enamel demineralization. variables were cells with and without endogenous substrate, rinsing with 10 per cent glucose or sucrose solution, or no rinsing and the type of organism. acid production from endogenous substrate by streptococcus mutans strain ib-1600, due, at least in part, to intracellular glycogen degradation, caused a marked and prolonged ph drop and significant enamel demineralization. a similar but less marked effect was obtained with a strain of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. thus acid production from endogenous sources by plaque bacteria may be of importance in the aetiology of dental caries.

TI  == effects of highly concentrated stannous fluoride and chlorhexidine regimes on human dental plaque flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effect of an intensive antimicrobial treatment on the number of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus/actinomyces naeslundii, and the total colony-forming units (cfu) in plaque. the dentition of human volunteers was treated in a dental office with either chlorhexidine (5%) or stannous fluoride (8%). following the office treatment with chlorhexidine, selected volunteers rinsed daily at home for seven  or 49 days with chlorhexidine solution (0.2%), while another group flossed daily  at home for seven days with dental floss impregnated with chlorhexidine. on days  one, seven, 21, 35, and 49 after the local applications, we took saliva samples and plaque samples from fissures, smooth surfaces, and approximal areas. chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride suppressed s. mutans and the actinomyces species on all surfaces and in saliva. s. mutans on tooth surfaces was suppressed for approximately seven days and returned to the baseline level at day 21. a. viscosus/naeslundii was suppressed for more than seven days on the teeth. s. sanguis and the total cfu returned to the baseline level within seven days on all surfaces and in saliva. rinsing or flossing with chlorhexidine suppressed s. mutans during the period of time that these supplements were used. brushing for seven days with chlorhexidine gel (1%) without a preceding intensive chlorhexidine treatment had virtually no effect on s. mutans in approximal areas  and in saliva, but suppressed s. mutans in fissures and on smooth surfaces.

TI  == immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  == rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified streptococcus mutans l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. the enzyme affinity for pyruvate or nadh decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate  (fdp) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. a partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with fdp prior to the antibody adjunction. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when fdp was added. the protective effect observed with fdp could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. a decrease of antibody binding in the presence of fdp was also obtained with s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. nadh did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. on the contrary,  pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. a decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.

AB  == intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. the microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant  differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. streptococci, especially s. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.

TI  == nonbactericidal approach to reduce colonization of plaque microflora on teeth in  vitro and in vivo.
AB  == a non-antibacterial, surface-modifying, perfluorosulfonamidoalkyl ester of phosphorous acid (psaep, 1) was adsorbed to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disks in vitro. pretreatment of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads with different concentrations of 1 markedly reduced the adherence of radiolabeled streptococcus  mutans or actinomyces viscosus when compared with the buffer-treated controls. pretreatment of the cells with the compound also significantly impaired their subsequent attachment to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. in a low surface-to-volume ratio adsorption model, i.e., saliva-coated hydroxapatite disks, pretreatment with 1 for 1 min markedly reduced the adsorption of a. viscosus to the disks. a 1% solution applied topically twice a day significantly (alpha = 0.05) reduced s. mutans-induced smooth and fissure caries in rats. the effect of 0.05% 1 in a rinse was also evaluated on experimental gingivitis in beagle dogs for 6 weeks. a topical application twice a day significantly (alpha = 0.05) reduced plaque-induced gingivitis when compared to that achieved with the placebo. microbial analyses of the plaque adjacent to gingiva indicated reduction in filamentous medium and large spirochetes as compared with that seen in the pretreatment phase. collectively, the results show that it is possible to reduce  dental caries and gingivitis via an interference with the specific adsorption of  organisms to teeth.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  == in this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. the patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. the bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. odontolyticus and  s. mutans and significantly lower proportions of b. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. the spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (ap) patients,  averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. the bacteriological results could not distinguish between ada type iii and iv periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any ap patient. the patients designated as early onset periodontitis (eop) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of bacteroides gingivalis and/or b. intermedius. two types of eop were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. four localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients were notable in not having detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of ljp are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

TI  == microbiological aspects of some caloric sugar substitutes.
AB  == several caloric sugar substitutes are available today, e.g. maltitol, lycasin, sorbitol, xylitol, palatinit, sorbose, coupling sugar, palatinose, fructose and invert sugar. when evaluating the cariogenicity of these sugar substitutes from a bacteriological point of view, different analytical procedures should be considered. in vitro studies on the capacity of pure oral bacterial strains and dental plaque material to decompose the substitute to acid. studies on the catabolism of the substitute. possible adaptation of the oral microflora to metabolize the substitute in vivo as well as in vitro. studies on any inhibitory  effect of the substitute on the microbial activities in dental plaque and on the  oral microflora. the capacity of oral bacteria, e.g. streptococcus mutans, to induce caries in animal experiments should also be considered. results from such  microbiological studies make it possible to classify the caloric sugar substitutes into different groups. the first, most suitable, group seems to consist of xylitol and sorbose. these substitutes are fermented by few oral bacteria and no negative adaptation of the oral flora has been observed. a reducing effect upon dental plaque formation and on acid production from glucose  has been reported. a second group consists of maltitol, palatinite, palatinose, sorbitol and lycasin. these substitutes are fermented by certain groups of organisms within the oral genera actinomyces, lactobacillus and streptococcus. adaptation of oral bacteria to palatinose and to sorbitol, resulting in a more pronounced acid production, has been observed. no inhibitory effects have been reported. the results from experimental studies suggest that these sugar substitutes have no or little cariogenic action in rodents inoculated with s. mutans.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

TI  == lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) from streptococcus mutans omz175 was purified to homogeneity as judged  by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. the purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, deae-sephacel and blue-sepharose cl.6b chromatography, and sephacryl s200 gel permeation. the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between ph 5 and 6.2. the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was  around 0.02 mm and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. the enzyme seemed  to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mm enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. the enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to nadh, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a hill coefficient of about 1.9. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on sephacryl s200. monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. antibodies obtained against the purified s. mutans omz175 ldh cross-reacted with the sodium  dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of ldhs from different s. mutans serotypes, streptococcus sanguis omz9, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, and actinomyces viscosus ny 1. a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of l-ldhs from s. mutans serotypes and s. sanguis. cross-reactions were also observed with the ldhs from a. viscosus and l. casei, the latter being the least related. a very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the l-ldh from s. mutans omz175 and the d-ldh from lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be  detected with mammal ldhs.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == a-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic from actinoplanes sp., was evaluated as a potential antiplaque agent in comparison with chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, and cetylpyridinium chloride. a-16686 had good activity against gram-positive organisms associated with dental plaque (various streptococci, streptococcus mutans in particular, lactobacilli, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii); most of the strains tested were clinical isolates. it was bactericidal for streptococci (mbc/mic ratio of less than or equal to 8 for 92% of the strains) and for growing cells of s. mutans briefly exposed to antibiotic (99.9% killing within 5 min of contact with 200 micrograms of a-16686  per ml). it also inhibited the in vitro plaque formation by s. mutans and had good activity against preformed plaques. for most cases, its activity was comparable to those of chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, and cetylpyridinium  chloride. a-16686 appears to be a promising antiplaque agent because of the following attributes: narrow spectrum of activity, rapid bactericidal action, lack of selection of resistant mutants, absence of cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics, nonabsorption by oral route, good tolerability by the oral mucosa (rats and dogs), and physical characteristics (white powder, soluble in water).

AB  == compared with anion-activated cell lysis of oral bacteria damaged with either lysozyme or trypsin, cells which were treated with both of these enzymes showed a far greater degree of lysis. this was true regardless of whether turbidimetric, dna release, or electron microscopic assays were used to monitor the lytic process. at an acidic ph of 5.2 and an nahco3 concentration of 100 mm, the kinetics of lysis for two different serotype c strains of streptococcus mutans were similar. at 0 to 100 mm bicarbonate, however, differences in the lytic susceptibilities of the two strains were evident. at ph 5.2, nahco3, but not nascn, nacl, or naf, was effective in promoting cell lysis of the oral bacteria.  at apparent sublytic concentrations of nahco3, lysis was achieved by adding appropriate concentrations of nascn, nacl, or naf to the lysozyme-protease-damaged cells. in in vivo studies, hamsters given a combination of nahco3, nacl, and nascn were found to have significantly reduced levels of s.  mutans on their molar teeth compared with that found in controls or animals exposed to any one of the salts alone or to a combination of chloride and thiocyanate only. the results suggest that bicarbonate is an essential anion which, together with the other major salivary inorganic monovalent anions, plays  an active role in the lysis and ultimate elimination of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == carbohydrate composition of dental plaque from primates with irradiation caries.
AB  == carbohydrate analyses were performed on dental plaque collected from the teeth of irradiated monkeys, non-irradiated monkeys and a group of streptococcus mutans free animals, all of which were fed the same standard cariogenic diet. glucose was the predominant sugar constituent in plaque and was detected in highest concentration in the irradiated animals. small amounts of pentoses and other hexoses were also present. plaque from irradiated animals contained, by comparison with the other groups, higher levels of strep. mutans and lower levels of streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces.

TI  == growth of oral streptococcus species and actinomyces viscosus in human saliva.
AB  == microorganisms in dental plaque live in constant association with saliva. the role of saliva in the adherence of bacteria to the teeth and the antibacterial properties of saliva have been well investigated; less interest has been shown in the possible role of saliva as a substrate for oral microorganisms. in this study it was shown that saliva can serve as a growth medium for oral streptococcus spp. and actinomyces viscosus. the cell production of these organisms on saliva was carbohydrate limited. the doubling times for growth on glucose-supplemented saliva (4 to 5 mmol/liter) ranged from 1.6 to 4.0 h. the availability of carbohydrate sources for the oral microflora is discussed in relation to microbial growth in the oral cavity.

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == a conceptual model for the co-existence of streptococcus spp. and actinomyces spp. in dental plaque.
AB  == one of the most important questions in ecology is how to explain the co-existence of the variety of physiologically related organisms in the same habitat. a model  is presented for the co-existence of streptococcus species and actinomyces species in dental plaque. the hypothesis is that these organisms co-exist because they simultaneously utilize several carbon and energy substrates. the hypothesis  follows from the observation that the growth yield of oral streptococci and actinomyces in saliva is limited by carbohydrate. preliminary experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis using mixed chemostat cultures and gnotobiotic  rats. competition between s. mutans k1r and a. viscosus ut2 in mixed chemostat cultures on glucose and asparagine was hampered by the early appearance of high-glucose-affinity variants of a. viscosus. from the physiological characteristics of s. sanguis and s. milleri, it might be predicted that simultaneous utilization of carbohydrate and arginine would enable these organisms to co-exist with s. mutans in an ecosystem. to test this mechanism under natural conditions, germ-free rats were inoculated with a combination of s. mutans k1r and s. sanguis p4a7 or the combination s. mutans k1r and s. milleri b448. the rats were fed on three different diets: (1) 58% cornstarch; (2) 48% cornstarch and 10% sucrose; and (3) 53% cornstarch and 5% arginine. the results of this experiment demonstrated that dietary arginine caused a significant decrease of the ratios k1r/p4a7 and k1r/b448 in dental plaque.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == five successive experiments, with rats fed ad libitum on diets containing sucrose or lycasin 80/55, were carried out. in experiment i, the rats were inoculated with streptococcus mutans alone or with strep. mutans in combination with actinomyces viscosus. in three successive transmission experiments (ii, iii, iv), the rats were inoculated with plaque of the rats of the preceding experiment. the rats of experiment v were inoculated with the original strains or with plaque derived from experiment iv. after five successive transmissions of the plaque flora, no alterations were demonstrated in the numbers and percentages of strep.  mutans and a. viscosus or in the fermentation rate of lycasin by the plaque flora in vitro. lycasin 80/55 was virtually non-cariogenic compared with sucrose (p less than 0.001) irrespective of whether the rats were inoculated with strep. mutans alone or in combination with a. viscosus, with the original strains or with plaque from the preceding experiments with rats on a lycasin 80/55-containing diet.

TI  == growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  == the effects of mutual interaction and host diet on the growth rates of the bacteria actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans during colonization of tooth surfaces in di-associated gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the bacteria were simultaneously inoculated into the mouths of germ-free rats. the maximum growth rates attained by strep. mutans (doubling time td = 1.4 h) or  a. viscosus (td = 2.7 h) were approximately the same as in mono-associated gnotobiotic rats [td = 1.1 and 2.8 h, respectively (beckers and van der hoeven, 1982a)]. the presence of glucose or sucrose did not affect the maximum growth rates. in starved rats, the accumulation of microorganisms tended to decline sooner, suggesting that the growth was limited by the availability of nutrients.  no interaction between the two organisms was detected at the stage of initial adherence to the tooth surfaces or during the first 24 h of growth. after that, the increase of a. viscosus was retarded in the presence of strep. mutans t2, but not with strep. mutans omz176. the retardation was more pronounced in the rats fed on glucose than on sucrose. yet, at 24 days after inoculation. a. viscosus had increased in the glucose more than in the sucrose group. hence sucrose did not stimulate the accumulation of strep. mutans more than glucose.

TI  == human serum precipitins to oral bacteria related to dental caries.
AB  == adults aged 20-38 years were classified by a positive (+) or negative (-) precipitating serum antibody response to d-alanyl glycerol teichoic acid (s), or  an antigen from actinomyces spp. (a). culture filtrates of streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were used to detect the respective specific antibodies by immunoelectrophoresis and immunodiffusion when present in serum at a concentration of more than 0.05 mg/ml. among subjects who had grown up in fluoridated areas, a+ subjects exhibited significantly fewer decayed, missing and filled teeth or teeth surfaces compared to a- subjects (p less than 0.02). for the whole population examined, caries severity increased with age and decreased with length of residence in a fluoridated area (p less than 0.01). when classified by a and s antibody response, only s-subjects showed a significant increase in caries score with age (p less than 0.02) and only a+s+ subjects a significant decrease in score with length of exposure to fluoridated water (p less than 0.05). it is concluded that the severity of caries in relation to age and fluoride exposure may differ in subjects with the different antibody specificities.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed infections in the oral cavity.
AB  == in almost all infections in the oral cavity, mixed populations of bacteria are present. however, recent evidence points to a certain specificity in these infections: streptococcus mutans is related to caries and black-pigmented bacteroides species are suspected pathogens in periodontal disease. periodontal diseases, endodontic infections and submucous abscesses in the oral cavity are probably mixed infections in which anaerobic bacteria together with facultatives  or other anaerobes are present. in experimental mixed anaerobic infections black-pigmented bacteroides strains have been shown to play a key role. little is known about the pathogenic synergy between the bacteria involved in mixed infections. important mechanisms could be nutritional interrelationships and interactions with the host defense. within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides b. gingivalis seems to be the most virulent species. these bacteria possess a great number of virulence factors, which might be important in the pathogenesis of oral infections.

TI  == relationship between oxygen tension and subgingival bacterial flora in untreated  human periodontal pockets.
AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.

TI  == carbohydrate metabolism by actinomyces viscosus growing in continuous culture.
AB  == a human oral strain of actinomyces viscosus, gn431/75, was grown anaerobically in a defined medium in continuous culture with a glucose limitation at dilution rates (d) between 0.025 and 0.2 h-1 and with a nitrogen limitation at d = 0.005 and 0.1 h-1. with 5 mg of glucose per ml, the culture was limited for carbon at d = 0.025 and 0.05 h-1, but became nitrogen limited (asparagine) at d = 0.1 and 0.2 h-1. the molar growth yield (yglucose) decreased from 50.0 to 40.9 g of cells per mol of glucose as the dilution rate was increased from 0.025 to 0.2 h-1, reflecting the limitation of asparagine. with high glucose and low amino acid concentrations (nitrogen limited), the cell yields at d = 0.05 and 0.1 h-1 were 37 to 33% lower than in the glucose-limited culture. the major products of metabolism were succinic and lactic acids with lesser amounts of acetic and formic acids and ethanol. the rate of glucose fermentation by resting cells removed from the glucose-limited culture and assayed in a ph stat increased with  the dilution rate and was always higher than that for the fermentation of sucrose (60%) and fructose (40%). activity for the glucose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system was observed in whole homogenates, with the highest activity evident at d = 0.1 h-1 with the glucose-limited culture. the observed activity was significantly lower than the rate of glucose metabolism at each dilution rate, suggesting that glucose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system was underestimated or that an additional transport system exists in the organism. the glucose-limited culture showed considerable ability to synthesize glycogen during the transition from carbon to nitrogen limitation, when 35% of the cell mass was present at this polymer. the organism was shown to possess the glycogen  synthetic enzymes adp glucose synthase and adp glucose transferase, as well as the degradative enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase. washed cells of a. viscosus gn431/75 were shown to be relatively insensitive to the inhibiting actions of naf in ph-fall and constant-ph experiments at all dilution rates. at ph 7.0, 25 mm naf was required to completely inhibit glycolysis by glucose-limited cells at d = 0.05 h-1, whereas a concentration of only 11 mm naf was required with cells of streptococcus mutans grown and incubated under identical conditions. an interesting feature of the growth of a. viscosus gn431/75 in the chemostat was the shift from individual nonadherent cells at the low dilution rates to the appearance at d = 0.2 h-1 of large cell aggregates forming tenacious adherent films reminiscent of its characteristics in the oral cavity.

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

TI  == bacterial adherence in the mouth.
AB  == studies of the adherence of bacteria indigenous to the human mouth have contributed greatly to our understanding of oral bacterial ecology. bacterial adhesion to teeth and oral epithelial surfaces seems to be indispensable for the  formation of dental plaque and for the persistent colonization of mucosal surfaces. the strength of adhesion to various oral surfaces differs widely among  oral bacteria and is a major reason for their different intraoral localization. considerable evidence suggests that the adhesion of different bacteria to the acquired pellicle on teeth or to mucosal surfaces as well as the adhesive processes involved in plaque accumulation entail different, specific interactions that are mediated by receptors on the bacterial cell surface, on the oral surfaces, and on plaque matrix components. some of these interactions may involve lectin-like binding. knowledge of the mechanisms by which suspected odontopathogens such as streptococcus mutans and certain actinomyces species may  adhere to oral surfaces has been discussed. successful methods for interfering with bacterial adhesion to human oral surfaces have not been developed yet.

AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

AB  == a solid phase radioimmunoassay has been developed which can be used for the detection of isotype specific antibodies to whole bacteria and other particulate  antigens, and is applicable to a variety of species. bacteria are bound to the solid phase by the use either of antibodies, or of methyl glyoxal. both methods result in a sensitive and reproducible assay, and bacteria do not appear to desorb from the solid phase. the specificity of antibodies to whole bacteria was  examined by absorption of antisera with various species of bacteria and retesting, or by determining the binding of antisera to various bacteria bound to the solid phase. both methods revealed specificity for the bacteria examined. inhibition studies showed that antibodies to streptococcus mutans whole cells could be inhibited by purified cell surface antigens glucosyltransferase and antigen i/ii, but only minimally by lipoteichoic acid, c polysaccharide or dextran. in murine antisera antibodies of the igg, igm, and iga classes could be  detected at amounts of less than 1 ng/ml.

AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.

TI  == the acidogenic microbial composition of dental plaque from caries-free and caries-prone people.
AB  == plaque samples collected from caries-free and caries-prone subjects were analysed for total bacteria, the ratio of acidogenic to total organisms and the proportions of streptococci, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces. the acidogenic composition of plaque reflected the dietary habits and caries status of an individual. a high acidogenic ratio was found in individuals with active lesions  or recent restorations; individuals who were caries-free or had no recent lesions had a lower ratio although total organisms were similar. the ratio remained constant in sequential samples from caries-prone subjects but was increased by frequent exposure to sugar. streptococci, actinomyces and strep. mutans were isolated from all samples but no consistent relationship was found between either their isolation frequency or proportions and caries status.

TI  == degradation of the microbial and salivary components participating in human dental plaque formation by proteases elaborated by plaque bacteria.
AB  == twenty-eight strains of facultative, gram-positive, sporulating bacilli which produce caseinolytic enzymes were isolated from human early dental plaque. a major component of the extracellular caseinolytic enzymes elaborated by strong producers seemed to be neutral zinc proteases. the extracellular proteases inactivated glucosyltransferase of streptococcus mutans and inhibited the synthesis of adherent glucans from sucrose. the enzymes also degraded the strep.  mutans cell-surface receptor for dextran and glucan, the receptor for salivary agglutinins, located on streptococcus sanguis cells, and the surface component of actinomyces viscosus cells involved in co-agglutination with strep. sanguis cells. the enzymes hydrolysed human whole saliva proteins, which seemed to result in loss of the ability to agglutinate strep. sanguis cells.

TI  == glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and actinomyces viscosus in the presence of human saliva.
AB  == glucose uptake was examined by using whole-cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans (strains bht, ingbritt, and gs-5), streptococcus mitis (strains 9811 and 72x41), and actinomyces viscosus (strains t6 and wvu626) incubated for up to 90 min in 0 to 82% (vol/vol) human whole salivary supernatant. glucose uptake by the s. mutans strains was completely inhibited at all saliva concentrations. dithiothreitol (dtt), present during saliva incubation, prevented saliva inhibition. glucose uptake was also restored when saliva-inhibited cells were subsequently exposed to dtt. the inclusion of catalase in the saliva incubation mixtures resulted in protection equal to that obtained with dtt. the s. mitis strains were also inhibited by saliva but to a far lesser extent that s. mutans.  dtt and catalase also protected s. mitis from saliva inhibition. both a. viscosus strains were completely refractory to saliva inhibition of glucose uptake. based  on (i) the sensitivity of the catalase-negative streptococci and the resistance of catalase-positive actinomyces to saliva inhibition and (ii) the equal and complete protection to saliva inhibition afforded by dtt and catalase, we conclude that the lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in saliva was the only antibacterial system expressed under our experimental conditions. the relative resistance of s. mitis 9811 (compared with s. mutans bht) to saliva inhibition was shown not to result from poor h(2)o(2) production in either glucose-supplemented buffer or saliva solutions. s. mitis produced inhibitory quantities of h(2)o(2) that equaled or exceeded s. mutans h(2)o(2) accumulation.  it is suggested that s. mitis might possess a greater ability to repair lactoperoxidase-mediated damage than does s. mutans. every organism studied exhibited a saliva concentration-dependent, cell growth-independent stimulation of glucose uptake after 60 to 90 min of incubation. the a. viscosus and s. mitis  strains showed saliva stimulation (or stabilization) of glucose uptake with unsupplemented saliva. in the case of s. mutans, saliva stimulation was only observed when dtt was present. the possible role of salivary lactoperoxidase as a modulator of the intraoral site specificities exhibited by s. mutans is discussed.

TI  == effect of microbial interaction on the colonization rate of actinomyces viscosus  or streptococcus mutans in the dental plaque of rats.
AB  == the resident oral microflora of conventional osborne-mendel rats was challenged with actinomyces viscosus or streptococcus mutans strains. the adherence of the inoculated organism to the tooth surface and the subsequent growth were studied by means of viable counts determination. the initial growth rate of s. mutans in  conventional rats was lower than in mono-associated gnotobiotic rats (doubling time, td = 5 h versus td = 1.1 h). the delayed start of growth and the low initial growth rate indicated that a competitive interaction between s. mutans and the resident microflora occurred. the initial growth rate of a. viscosus in conventional rats (td = 3.1 h) was approximately the same as that in gnotobiotic  rats (td = 2.8 h). the start of growth of a. viscosus was only slightly delayed compared with the start in gnotobiotic rats. these results suggest a neutralistic relationship between a. viscosus and the resident microflora. a. viscosus reached a stationary level about 7 days after inoculation, whereas the s. mutans strains  did not reach stationary levels until 2 weeks after inoculation.

AB  == an extracellular soluble common protein (ecp) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of streptococcus sanguis omz9, of a representative strain of each of bratthall's seven serological groups of streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of lactobacillus salivarius and actinomyces viscosus. the ecp antigens from the different strains  were prepared from sds-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography  on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. the identity of such purified ecp antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in sds-page, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. this common antigen (ecp) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  == plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied.  to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and s. sanguis  constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). a few isolates of "s. mitior" and "s. milleri" were found, but no s. salivarius. staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of s. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. the large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.

TI  == microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low ph isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  == longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml)  at ph levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both ph and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. strains of streptococcus and neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at ph levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. the most commonly isolated streptococci were streptococcus mitior and s. salivarius. s. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at ph 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at ph 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. despite their known fluoride resistance, actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. the ph of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at ph 6.0 was only 30% of that at ph 7.0. representative strains of s. mutans, s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the ph and fluoride levels of the  medium on which they were initially isolated. fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount  of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. the isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the ph range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric s. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. in the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may  permit s. mitior to compete with s. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

AB  == the influence of the growth medium on the ability of strains of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii to attach to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) surfaces was studied. preliminary experiments indicated that cells of each species harvested in lag, log, and early stationary phases of  growth adsorbed comparably to s-ha; thus, early stationary phase cells were used  in all subsequent assays. strains were grown in chemically defined medium (cdm),  in cdm supplemented with gastric mucin or with filter-sterilized or (60)co-irradiated saliva from human donors of blood types a, b, or o, and in trypticase soy broth (bbl microbiology systems) and todd-hewitt broth. adherence  of s. mutans h12 to s-ha tended to vary when the streptococci were grown in saliva-supplemented cdm, but the number of cells which attached was generally within twofold of that of cdm-grown cells. attachment of a. viscosus s2 and ly7 and of a. naeslundii s4 and l13 was generally similar when grown in cdm or in cdm supplemented with saliva, but it tended to increase for organisms grown in cdm supplemented with gastric mucin. none of the strains studied appeared to destroy  the blood group reactivity of the added salivary components, and they attached equally well to ha treated with homologous or heterogous saliva from that present in the medium in which they were grown. the a. viscosus strains adsorbed in 25 to 40% higher numbers to ha treated with blood type b saliva than with type a saliva, irrespective of the medium used for growth. s. mutans h12 cells displayed alpha- and beta-glucosidase and alpha-galactosidase activity; the actinomyces strains exhibited these activities plus beta-galactosidase when grown in all media. however, the levels of these glycoside hydrolases did not correlate with cell adsorption to s-ha. the apparent weak influence of the growth medium on attachment of s. mutans was studied further. strains of s. mutans isolated from the saliva of five human donors were made resistant to streptomycin, grown in cdm, and then added to new saliva samples from the respective donors from which they were obtained. the in vitro-grown cells were found to attach to s-ha comparably to s. mutans cells present naturally in the saliva.

AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

AB  == ten laboratory strains of oral microorganisms and 17 recent clinical isolates were examined for their ability to concentrate fluoride from a 1 ppm (0.05 mm naf( fluoride solution. the laboratory strains concentrated the ion from two- to  six-fold over the surrounding media. clinical isolates of actinomyces concentrated the ion to similar levels to the laboratory strains of this organism; however, clinical isolates of streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis concentrated the fluoride significantly less than any of the laboratory strains examined.

TI  == differences in the adsorptive behavior of human strains of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == human strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii differ in the time of their appearance and in their patterns of colonization in the mouth. strains of these organisms were found to differ in their abilities to adsorb to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) surfaces, thought to mimic the teeth, and these differences parallel their patterns of colonizing the dentition. thus, strains of a. viscosus tended to adsorb in higher numbers to hydroxyapatite (ha)  treated with saliva of older children and adults than with saliva of younger children (ages 6 to 11). these salivary changes may account for the increased frequency with which this organism can be isolated from the mouths of children as they grow older. in contrast, strains of a. naeslundii and streptococcus mutans did not show a preference for attaching to either type of s-ha. strains of a. viscosus also generally adsorbed in higher numbers than a. naeslundii to ha treated with adult saliva; this may explain why higher proportions of a. viscosus are usually recoverable from the teeth of adults, even though a. naeslundii is generally present in higher proportions in saliva. significant variation was noted between strains and between saliva samples collected from different donors. the differences in adsorptive behavior of strains of these species suggests that  they are binding to different receptors in the salivary glycoprotein coating on ha surfaces. adsorption of a. naeslundii atcc 12104 was enhanced when s-ha was pretreated with neuraminidase, but this had little effect upon the adsorption of  other actinomyces strains tested. adsorption of strain atcc 12104 to s-ha was also strongly inhibited by fructose and sucrose and weakly inhibited by glucose,  maltose, galactose, and lactose. however, other strains of a. naeslundii tested were affected less, or not at all, by these sugars. adsorption of two strains of  a. viscosus was not affected by any of the sugars or amines tested.

TI  == two-hour bacterial colonization of dental luting cements in vivo.
AB  == test specimens of zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, zinc oxide-eba, silico-phosphate and resin cements were carried in the mouth for 2 hours. the bacteria adhering to the cement specimens were quantified after culture on selective and non-selective, solid media. significantly fewer bacteria could be recovered from the eba cement than from the other cement types. all cement specimens, as well as samples from tooth surfaces, showed selective enrichment of actinomyces viscosus compared with the proportion of this organism in saliva. the silicophosphate and particularly the polycarboxylate cement were poor substrates  for the adhesion of streptococcus mutans. scanning electron micrographs revealed  heavy accumulations of coccoid and filamentous organisms on zinc phosphate cement surfaces. fewer bacteria, mainly cocci, were seen on the polycarboxylate and silico-phosphate cements, whereas the micrographs of the eba and resin cement surfaces were difficult to interpret.

TI  == common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == soluble extracellular antigens (esa) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a bio-gel p6 column. soluble cell wall antigens (wea) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6). antisera against whole cells of s. sanguis and  s. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell  walls, dextran, esa, and wea were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. esa and wea were prepared from a representative strain  of bratthall's seven serological groups, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus. all sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. the comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both esa and wea between the different strains. absorption of anti-esa sera with  wea, and anti-wea sera with esa, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in esa and wea.

TI  == further characteristics of beta2-microglobulin binding to oral streptococci.
AB  == a total of 85 strains of oral bacteria representing streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarious, s. milleri, s. infrequens, s. durans, s. lactis, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. equinus, streptococcus species group e, actinomyces, and one group a streptococcus were tested for binding of aggregated  human beta 2-microglobulin. positive affinity between bacteria and aggregated human beta 2-microglobulin was detected in 36% of the strains. no apparent correlation with bacterial species, serotype, or group was noted. no positive strains were detected among seven group i:a s. sanguis strains (p < 0.01). binding constants for one s. mutans strain indicated heterogeneous binding structures on the bacterial surface. the number of binding sites for aggregates of human beta 2-microglobulin involving multipoint attachment varied from 70 to 1,700 per bacterial cell. with whole saliva as buffer, a general increase in affinity was seen. variations in salt concentrations of the buffers revealed different salt-dependent species-associated uptake patterns. oral bacteria tended to have an uptake maximum at a salt concentration similar to that seen in saliva. binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on oral streptococci were  sensitive to pepsin, heat, and formaldehyde treatment. bacterial binding structures for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin might represent one of several factors of importance for bacterial attachment in the oral cavity. experimental conditions reflecting the salivary milieu increased the degree of interaction, emphasizing the importance of physiological test systems for such studies.

TI  == selective antibacterial properties of lysozyme for oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of lysozyme were investigated with oral microorganisms representing the seven serotypes (a through g) of streptococcus mutans, veillonella alcalescens, and the virulent (v) and avirulent (av) strains  of actinomyces viscosus t14. growth of bacteria in defined medium was monitored spectrophotometrically after the addition of various amounts (25 mug to 5 mg/ml)  of enzyme. no growth inhibition of v. alcalescens was observed. inhibition of a.  viscosus t14(v) and a. viscosus t14(av) occurred with 160 mug of lysozyme per ml. of the s. mutans cultures tested, the serotype a and b strains were inhibited with as little as 25 mug of enzyme per ml, whereas e and f strains were most resistant to the bacteriostatic activity of lysozyme. the presence of dl-threonine or sucrose in growth medium did not significantly affect the results. a lysoplate assay was developed to rapidly survey the bacterial cultures for their susceptibility to the lytic ability of the enzyme. lysis, as a measure  of a zone of clearing in agarose plates, occurred for all microorganisms in the presence of lysozyme after the subsequent addition of nacl or detergent. the bactericidal activity of lysozyme was determined on s. mutans bht and s. mutans lm-7 by the pour plate technique. preincubation of s. mutans lm-7 with as much as 1 mg of enzyme for 90 min did not affect viability or growth, whereas preincubation of s. mutans bht with 1 mg of lysozyme resulted in no recoverable colony-forming units. an antigen containing extract of s. mutans lm-7 blocked the growth inhibitory property of lysozyme. human lysozyme was a more effective antibacterial factor than hen egg white lysozyme. total growth inhibition of s. mutans bht was effected with 40 mug of human enzyme, and as little as 10 mug of human enzyme inhibited growth for greater than 20 h. the data presented indicate  that different mechanisms may be responsible for the bacteriostatic, lytic, and bactericidal properties of the enzyme and that lysozyme is a selective but effective antibacterial factor for oral microorganisms.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

AB  == a method developed for the lysis of oral streptococci that employed the action of lysozyme suspended in dilute tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer containing polyethylene glycol has been adapted for use with lactobacilli, actinomycetes, propionibacteria, and pediococci. most of the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid was liberated from many strains of bacteria usually thought to be lysozyme resistant. the major observations were as follows: (i) supplementation of the growth medium with l-threonine, l-lysine, or both frequently produced cells that were more susceptible to lysis by lysozyme; (ii) glucose-containing media produced cells that were more easily lysed than those from cultures grown on other substrates; (iii) polyethylene glycol not only served as an osmotic stabilizer, it also enhanced the extent of lysis; and (iv) dilute tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer was superior to the buffer systems  most commonly employed in published muramidase-based lysis techniques. stationary-phase cells of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mutans were more  easily lysed than those isolated from log-phase cultures. the method as detailed  in this report should be generally applicable for the lysis of gram-positive, asporogenous bacteria.

AB  == the colonization of actinomyces viscosus strain ny-1r on the molar teeth of conventional and ex-germfree rats of various ages fed either a high-sucrose diet, a high-glucose diet, or laboratory chow was studied. conventional rats directly after weaning and up to 30 days of age are less susceptible to experimental infection by strain ny-1r than are older rats regardless of the test diet. the relationship between host age and susceptibility to infection is also demonstrable in ex-germfree rats fed a high-sucose diet. host factors responsible for the differences in susceptibility were investigated. the results from these studies do not implicate host antibodies, host indigenous flora, or host saliva.  in other studies, it was demonstrated that within the mouths of rats, strain ny-1r preferentially colonizes in the pits and fissures of the molar teeth rather than on the dorsum of the tongue or on the vestibular mucosa. in short-term experiments, it was found that strain ny-1r attaches to the first molars of 40-day-old conventional rats to a greater extent than it attaches to the first molars of 20-day-old rats. the differences in attachment and subsequent colonization of strain ny-1r in 20- and 40-day-old rats may be related to the varying amounts of the reduced enamel epithelium and connective tissue present in the fissures of the molar teeth.

TI  == specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of actinomyces viscosus or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of actinomyces viscosus or a. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of streptococcus sanguis or s. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii)  coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. the latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. cells that could be heat inactivated also  were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells  that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. coaggregation reactions of each kind were ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

TI  == stability of the resident microflora and the bacteriocinogeny of streptococcus mutans as factors affecting its establishment in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  == the outcome of the experimental implantation of streptococcus mutans strains in humans and animals is unpredictable, and neither success nor failure can be explained. it seems logical to assume that, apart from dietary and host factors,  the characteristics of the s. mutans strain involved and those of the resident plaque microflora are important in colonization. for example, previous work in this laboratory suggested that bacteriocin production accounts at least in part for the establishment of an invading bacterium in a microbial ecosystem. in the present study, a complex specific pathogen-free ny plaque ecosystem was obtained  by the inoculation of specific pathogen-free rats with actinomyces viscosus ny1 and s. sanguis ny101, and the establishment of s. mutans in such rats was then examined. it was found that bacteriocinogenic (bac(+)) strains generally colonized in much higher proportions than non-bacteriocinogenic (bac(-)) strains. moreover, the longer the delay in introducing s. mutans, the poorer was its establishment. shortly after inoculation of strains ny1 and ny101, there is probably a transient state in which microbial equilibrium has not been reached, but later the specific pathogen-free ny system attains a stable climax community  which more strongly resists invaders. the ability of a number of s. mutans strains to establish in such a climax community was then examined, and it was found that bac(+) strains generally established at a higher level than did bac(-) strains. in summary, it was concluded that, although the bac(+) state is an important property in the successful invasion of a plaque by s. mutans, the stability of the resident microflora is also an important factor.

AB  == several cationic, mixed and amphoteric surfactants were tested for their antimicrobial activity and ability to inhibit the formation of in vitro plaque by oral microorganisms. all had antimicrobial activity against actinomyces viscosus. actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. cationic surfactants were comparable to chlorhexidine in antimicrobial activity but were less effective in  inhibiting plaque formation. amphoteric surfactants were less effective than other detergents in antibacterial activity and had very limited capacity for the  inhibition of plaque formation. comparison of drug structure provides evidence that surfactant substantivity to saliva-coated enamel is a cation active process. saliva was found to have an antagonistic effect on the activity of cetylpyridinium chloride but not on triburon.

TI  == factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  == various factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. when the ph of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. when the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture ph values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. adjusting the final ph of these cultures to below 5.5 with hcl caused the cells to aggregate. cells from unsupplemented cultures with final ph values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at ph values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees c) occurred rapidly at ph values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher ph values. aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low ph and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. low ph values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.

AB  == extracellular products of 12 strains of streptococcus mutans and 5 additional species of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation of fibroblastoid cells (hela and av3) and blast transformation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal individuals. products from s. mutans strains aht and bht, streptococcus intermedius, and actinomyces viscosus inhibited [3h]thymidine uptake by fibroblastoid cells and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. products from s. mutans e49, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces naeslundii inhibited blast transformation of human lymphocytes but did not significantly inhibit the growth  of fibroblastoid cells. preparations from s. intermedius gave the greatest inhibitory activity against both target cell types; initial characterization of this preparation suggested a single factor active in both assays, in that the heat lability and sephadex g-200 elution profile were similar for the inhibitory  activity seen with the two cell types. the molecular weight of the inhibitor, estimated by gel filtration on sephadex g-200 and ultragel aca34, was approximately 160,000. the results strongly suggest that oral bacteria produce heat-labile substances that interfere with fibroblast proliferation and alter the lymphocytic immunological response.

TI  == binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  == lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (gtase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)c]sucrose. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to gtase. these cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than  did the cells of the remaining serotypes. lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to gtase than did the controls without added enzyme. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than  did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of gtase. lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. these results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated gtase does not create additional gtase binding sites in s. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the s. mutans strains after exposure to gtase. of these species, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. three mutant strains of s. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of gtase as the control. these results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of s. mutans. the results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than s. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free gtase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. the results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of s. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == predominant cultivable flora isolated from human root surface caries plaque.
AB  == plaque samples were obtained from tooth surfaces exhibiting typical lesions of root surface caries and were immediately cultured by a continuous anaerobic procedure. the bacterial composition of root caries flora was determined on individual samples. representative isolates from each specimen were characterized by morphological and physiological criteria. in addition, fluorescent antibody reagents were used to confirm the identification of streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus. the plaque samples could be divided into two groups on the  basis of the presence or absence of s. mutans in the plaque. in group i plaques,  s. mutans comprised 30 percent of the total cultivable flora. s. sanguis was either not found or was present in very low number. in group ii plaques, s. mutans was not detected, and s. sanguis formed 48 percent of the total plaque flora. a. viscosus was the dominant organism in all plaque samples, accounting for 47 percent of the group i isolates and 41 percent of the group ii isolates.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  == an indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. an electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. this labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with s. salivarius and s. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. these cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. no cross-reactions occurred with s. mutans, s. faecalis, actinomyces species, or bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed  to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI  == interdental localization of streptococcus mutans as related to dental caries experience.
AB  == the consistency of colonization of tooth surfaces by streptococcus mutans was studied by sampling four approximal molar surfaces of 9- to 13-year-old children  at weekly intervals. it was found that surfaces which harbored detectable levels  of the organism tended to be consistently positive, whereas surfaces which were free of detectable levels of the organism also tended to remain that way. of the  total surfaces studied, 81.7% were either consistently positive or consistently negative throughout five consecutive weekly samplings. these data indicate that s. mutans does not uniformly colonize the surfaces of teeth. the consistent localized patterns of colonization observed suggest that s. mutans is not readily transmitted from one tooth surface to another within the mouth. scanning electron microscope observations revealed that s. mutans colonized the teeth of monoinfected gnotobiotic rats as discrete localized colonies, whereas strains of  actinomyces naeslundii colonized in a more generalized manner. efforts to sterilize tooth surfaces by application of iodine solution indicated that the populations of s. mutans on some surfaces could be affected for at least 11 to 13 weeks after treatment. the number of tooth surfaces colonized by detectable proportions of s. mutans was found to be far lower in a group of 18 children from charlotte, n.c., with a low past caries experience than in 20 children from danvers, mass., with a high caries experience. the number of tooth surfaces infected with s. mutans therefore strongly paralleled the caries experience of these populations.

TI  == method for preclinical evaluation of antiplaque agents.
AB  == a preclinical method for the evaluation of antibacterial agents for use against dental plaques associated with caries and periodontal disease is proposed. the method is applicable to screening agents and to defining, in vitro, the minimal conditions required for maximal antiplaque effect. as a model of antiplaque agents, chlorhexidine was assessed in vitro against preformed plaques of microorganisms conducive to dental caries and periodontal disease. the agent was  bactericidal to plaques of nine strains of streptococcus mutans and one strain of actinomyces viscosus when used in a single treatment for 20 min at 2 x 10(-1)%, in two 2-min treatments on the same day, or in daily 2-min treatments at this same concentration. using the last of these experimental conditions, we then tested chlorhexidine in vivo by topical application to the maxillary teeth of infected hamsters and found it to be effective in controlling plaques of s. mutans and a. viscosus.
