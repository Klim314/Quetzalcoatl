TI  == a tyrosine phosphorylation switch controls the interaction between the transmembrane modulator protein wzd and the tyrosine kinase wze of lactobacillus  rhamnosus.
AB  == background: one proposed mechanism for assembly of secreted heteropolysaccharides by many gram positive bacteria relies on the coordinated action of a polymerization complex through reversible phosphorylation events. the role of the tyrosine protein kinase transmembrane modulator is, however, not well understood. results: the protein sequences deduced from the wzb, wzd and wze genes from lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 9595 and rw-9595 m contain motifs also found in corresponding proteins cpsb, cpsc and cpsd from streptococcus pneumoniae d39 (serotype 2). use of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that both wzd  and wze can be found in tyrosine phosphorylated form. when tyrosine 266 was mutated to phenylalanine, wzdy266f showed slightly less phosphorylated protein than those produced by using eight other tyrosine mutated wzd genes, when expressed along with wze and wzb in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in order to demonstrate the importance of atp for the interactions among these proteins, native and fusion wzb, wzd and wze proteins were expressed and purified from escherichia coli cultures. the modulator protein, wzd, binds with the phosphotyrosine kinase wze, irrespective of its phosphorylation status. however,  wze attained a higher phosphorylation level after interacting with phosphorylated wzd in the presence of 10 mm atp. this highly phosphorylated wze did not remain in close association with phosphorylated wzd. conclusion: the wze tyrosine kinase protein of lactobacillus rhamnosus thus carries out tyrosine phosphorylation of wzd in addition to auto- and trans- phosphorylation of the kinase itself.

TI  == a combination of probiotics and whey proteins enhances anti-obesity effects of calcium and dairy products during nutritional energy restriction in ap2-agouti transgenic mice.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus paracasei tmc0409, streptococcus thermophilus tmc1543 and whey proteins were used to prepare fermented milk. for the experiment ap2- agouti transgenic mice were pre-treated with a high-sucrose/high-fat diet for 6 weeks to induce obesity. the obese mice were fed a diet containing 1.2 % ca and either non-fat dried milk (nfdm) or probiotic-fermented milk (pfm) with nutritional energy restriction for 6 weeks. the animals were examined after the treatment for changes in body weight, fat pad weight, fatty acid synthase (fas) activity, lypolysis, the expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and skeletal muscle and the presence of biomarkers for oxidative and inflammatory stress in plasma. it was found that the pfm diet significantly reduced body weight, fat accumulation, and adipocyte fas activity, and increased adipocyte lipolysis as compared with the effects of the nfdm diet (p< 0.05). the adipose tissue gene expression of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11beta-hsd1) was significantly suppressed in mice that were fed pfm as compared with those that were fed nfdm (p< 0.05). pfm caused a greater up-regulation of skeletal muscle pparalpha, ppardelta, uncoupling protein 3 (ucp3) and glut4 expression and a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of insulin, malondialdehyde, tnf-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and c-reactive protein as compared with the effects of nfdm (p< 0.05). fermentation of milk with selected probiotics and  supplementation of milk with whey proteins may thus enhance anti-obesity effects  of ca and dairy products by the suppression of adipose tissue lipogenesis, activation of fat oxidation in skeletal muscle and reduction of oxidative and inflammatory stress.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == non-viable immunobiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 and its peptidoglycan improve systemic and respiratory innate immune response during recovery of immunocompromised-malnourished mice.
AB  == the effect of non-viable lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 and its cell wall and peptidoglycan on respiratory immunity in malnourished mice was studied. weaned mice were malnourished with a protein-free diet for 21d and received bcd during 7d (bcd) or bcd with nasal non-viable l. rhamnosus crl1505 (bcd+uv) or its cell wall (bcd+cw) or peptidoglycan (bcd+pg) supplementation during last 2d of the treatment. malnourished mice without treatment (mnc) and well-nourished mice (wnc) were used as controls. mice were infected nasally with streptococcus pneumoniae after treatments. resistance against pneumococci was reduced in mnc mice. repletion with bcd reduced lung and blood bacterial cell counts when compared to mnc mice but the counts did not reach the levels of the wnc group. however, when malnourished mice received bcd+uv, bcd+cw or bcd+pg, pneumococci was not detected in lung or blood samples. pneumococcal infection increased the levels of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-6, and il-10 in the respiratory tract, however  the values were lower in mnc than in wnc mice. bcd+uv and bcd+pg groups showed values of phagocytes, il-1beta and il-6 that were similar to wnc mice, while tnf-alpha was significantly higher in those groups when compared to wnc mice. moreover, bcd+uv and bcd+pg treatments improved levels of respiratory il-10, reaching values that were superior to those observed in wnc mice. the work demonstrates for the first time that non-viable probiotic bacteria or their cellular fractions could be an interesting alternative as mucosal immunomodulators, especially in immunocompromised hosts in which the use of live  bacteria might be dangerous.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB  == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of  vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were  also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological  analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans  resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == effectiveness of alternative methods for toothbrush disinfection: an in vitro study.
AB  == objective: this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative methods  for toothbrush disinfection. methods: two-hundred eighty toothbrushes were included in the study. the toothbrushes were divided into 7 groups and were contaminated by standardized suspensions of lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus), streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus),  and escherichia coli (e. coli). the following disinfectants were tested: 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl), 100% and 50% white vinegar, microwave (mw) oven, ultraviolet (uv) sanitizer, and mouth rinse-containing propolis (mcp). data were  analyzed with kruskal wallis and dunn's tests. results: statistically significant differences were found between different methods and control group for all tested bacteria. there were statistically significant differences between all test groups for all microorganisms. mw was the most effective for l. rhamnosus and 100% white vinegar was the most effective method for s. mutans and s. aureus. naocl was the most effective for e. coli. conclusion: this study showed that 100% white vinegar was considered to be effective for tested microorganisms. similarly, 1% naocl is cost-effective, easily accessible, and comparatively effective for toothbrush disinfection. because these agents are nontoxic, cost-effective and easily accessible, they may be appropriate for household use.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus salivarius on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by streptococcus mutans. this study was conducted to isolate  potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against s. mutans biofilm  formation from lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. we analysed 64 l. salivarius strains and found that two, k35 and k43, significantly  inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced  than those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of s. mutans with k35 or k43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. spot assay for s. mutans indicated that k35 and k43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against s. mutans than lgg. moreover,  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd was reduced when s. mutans were co-cultured with k35 or k43. however, lgg activated the expression of gtfb and gtfc, but did not influence the expression of gtfd in the co-culture. a  transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. in conclusion, we identified two l. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of s. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. this is  not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == production of folate in oat bran fermentation by yeasts isolated from barley and  diverse foods.
AB  == aims: the focus of the research was to identify yeasts from barley kernels in order to study their folate production capability while maintaining high viscosity caused by soluble fibres in oat bran fermentation. methods and results: the 65 isolated yeasts were characterized by api carbohydrate utilization tests,  and assays for extracellular enzyme activities were the following: amylase, beta-glucanase, cellulase or cmcase, lipase, protease and xylanase. yeasts were identified by partial dna sequencing of the 25s d1/d2 and its1-5.8s-its2 regions. they belonged to the genera aureobasidium, cryptococcus, pseudozyma and rhodotorula. folate production was determined from supernatant and cells grown in a rich laboratory medium or directly from oat bran solution inoculated with the appropriate yeast. food yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida milleri, kluyveromyces marxianus and galactomyces geotrichum, were used for comparison. most of the yeasts isolated from barley destroyed the solid, viscous structure of the oat bran solution, indicating that they degraded the viscosity-generating soluble fibres, considered to be nutritionally advantageous. the best folate producers were s. cerevisiae, followed by pseudozyma sp., rhodotorula glutinis and k. marxianus. the yeasts maintaining high viscosity were used together with lactic acid bacteria (lab) streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus  to ferment oat bran solution. none of the yeasts isolated from barley, contrary to s. cerevisiae and c. milleri, produced together with lab significant amounts of folate. conclusions: fermentative yeasts together with lab are potential for use in developing novel high folate content healthy foods and snacks from oat bran. significance and impact of the study: high soluble fibre content and high natural folate content but low energy content food and snack products with pleasant fermentation aroma provide possibilities for new developments in the food industry.

TI  == modulation of the inflammation-coagulation interaction during pneumococcal pneumonia by immunobiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505: role of toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == the present study evaluated the effect of nasally given lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 on the immunocoagulative response during pneumococcal infection in immunocompetent mice. in addition, we aimed to gain insight into the mechanism involved in the immunomodulatory effect of the l. rhamnosus crl1505 strain by evaluating the role of tlr2. results showed that nasally given l. rhamnosus crl1505 effectively regulates inflammation and hemostatic alterations during the  pneumococcal infection. immunobiotic treatment significantly reduced permeability of the bronchoalveolar-capillary barrier, and general cytotoxicity, decreasing lung tissue damage. the crl1505 strain improved the production of tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, and il-10 after pneumococcal challenge. in addition, increased tm and  tf expressions were found in lungs of l. rhamnosus crl1505-treated mice. moreover, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the tlr2 signaling pathway has a role in the induction of ifn-gamma and il-10 and in the reduction of tf. the results also allow us to speculate that a prr, other than tlr2, may mediate the immunobiotic activity of l. rhamnosus crl1505 and could explain changes in tnf-alpha and tm.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

AB  == this work studied the effect of protein malnutrition on the hemato-immune response to the respiratory challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae and evaluated whether the dietary recovery with a probiotic strain has a beneficial effect in that response. three important conclusions can be inferred from the results presented in this work: a) protein-malnutrition significantly impairs the emergency myelopoiesis induced by the generation of the innate immune response against pneumococcal infection; b) repletion of malnourished mice with treatments including nasally or orally administered lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 are able to significantly accelerate the recovery of granulopoiesis and improve innate immunity and; c) the immunological mechanisms involved in the protective effect of immunobiotics vary according to the route of administration. the study demonstrated that dietary recovery of malnourished mice with oral or nasal administration of l. rhamnosus crl1505 improves emergency granulopoiesis and that cxcr4/cxcr12 signaling would be involved in this effect. then, the results summarized here are a starting point for future research and open up broad prospects for future applications of probiotics in the recovery of immunocompromised malnourished hosts.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == cariogenic effects of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg in a dental biofilm model.
AB  == probiotic bacteria have been suggested to inhibit streptococcus mutans (sm) and thus prevent dental caries. however, supporting evidence is weak and probiotic species might be cariogenic themselves. thus, we compared and combined the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) with sm and analysed the resulting mineral loss (deltaz) in dental tissues. we simulated three biofilm compositions  (sm, lgg, sm x lgg), two lesion sites (smooth enamel, dentin cavity) and two nutrition supply frequencies (twice/day, 6 times/day) in a multi-station, continuous-culture biofilm model. a total of 240 bovine enamel and dentin samples were cut, polished and embedded. all experimental procedures were performed in independent duplicates, with 10 samples being allocated to each group for each experiment (final sample size n = 20/group). biofilms were cultured on the specimens and supplied with 2% sucrose medium and artificial saliva in consecutive pulses. after 10 days, deltaz and bacterial numbers were assessed. sm x lgg biofilms caused significantly increased deltaz compared with sm or lgg biofilms (p < 0.01, mann-whitney test), and deltaz was significantly increased in dentin cavities compared with smooth enamel lesions (p < 0.01). bacterial numbers did not significantly differ between biofilms of different species (p > 0.05, anova). frequent nutrition supply significantly increased bacterial numbers (p <  0.01). biofilms in dentin cavities compared to smooth enamel harboured significantly more bacteria (p < 0.05). lgg induced mineral loss especially in dentin cavities and under highly cariogenic conditions. lgg did not have inhibitory effects on sm, but rather contributed to the caries process in vitro.

TI  == structural determinants for ligand capture by a class ii preq1 riboswitch.
AB  == prequeuosine (preq1) riboswitches are rna regulatory elements located in the 5' utr of genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of preq1, a precursor of  the modified base queuosine universally found in four trnas. the preq1 class ii (preq1-ii) riboswitch regulates preq1 biosynthesis at the translational level. we present the solution nmr structure and conformational dynamics of the 59 nucleotide streptococcus pneumoniae preq1-ii riboswitch bound to preq1. unlike in the preq1 class i (preq1-i) riboswitch, divalent cations are required for high-affinity binding. the solution structure is an unusual h-type pseudoknot featuring a p4 hairpin embedded in loop 3, which forms a three-way junction with  the other two stems. (13)c relaxation and residual dipolar coupling experiments revealed interhelical flexibility of p4. we found that the p4 helix and flanking  adenine residues play crucial and unexpected roles in controlling pseudoknot formation and, in turn, sequestering the shine-dalgarno sequence. aided by divalent cations, p4 is poised to act as a "screw cap" on preq1 recognition to block ligand exit and stabilize the binding pocket. comparison of preq1-i and preq1-ii riboswitch structures reveals that whereas both form h-type pseudoknots  and recognize preq1 using one a, c, or u nucleotide from each of three loops, these nucleotides interact with preq1 differently, with preq1 inserting into different grooves. our studies show that the preq1-ii riboswitch uses an unusual  mechanism to harness exquisite control over queuosine metabolism.

TI  == effect of two probiotic strains of lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. this microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. for these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes) were used. the lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of s. aureus, s. agalactiae and l. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (p < 0.01).  the lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. the aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == use of microparticulated whey protein concentrate, exopolysaccharide-producing streptococcus thermophilus, and adjunct cultures for making low-fat italian caciotta-type cheese.
AB  == low-fat caciotta-type cheeses were manufactured with partially skim milk (fat content of ~0.3%) alone (lfc); with the supplementation of 0.5% (wt/vol) microparticulated whey protein concentrate (mwpc) (lfc-mwpc); with mwpc and exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st446 (lfc-mwpc-eps); and with mwpc, eps-producing strain st446, and lactobacillus plantarum lp and lactobacillus rhamnosus lra as adjunct cultures (lfc-mwpc-eps-a). the non-eps-producing isogenic variant streptococcus thermophilus st042 was used for making full-fat caciotta-type cheese (ffc), lfc,  and lfc-mwpc. cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. compared with ffc and lfc (51.6 +/- 0.7 to 53.0 +/- 0.9%), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60.5 +/- 1.1 to 67.5 +/- 0.5%). the mwpc mainly contributed to moisture retention. overall, all lfc had approximately one-fourth (22.6 +/- 0.8%) of the fat of ffc. hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7d of ripening. microbial eps positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of lfc without mwpc or microbial eps was excessively firm. free amino acids were at the highest levels in lfc treatments (2,705.8 +/-  122 to 3,070.4 +/- 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of mwpc and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated lfc variants and ffc. the  sensory attributes pleasant to taste, intensity of flavor, overall acceptability, and pleasant to chew variously described lfc-mwpc-eps and lfc-mwpc-eps-a. based on the technology options used, low-fat caciotta-type cheese (especially ripened  for 14 d) has promising features to be further exploited as a suitable alternative to the full-fat variant.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 beneficially modulates the immuno-coagulative response after pneumococcal infection in immunocompromised malnourished mice.
AB  == this work evaluated the effect of orally or nasally administered lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 on the resistance of immunocompromised protein-malnourished mice to pneumococcal infection. in particular, we aimed to gain knowledge of the  mechanism involved in the immunomodulatory effect of l. rhamnosus crl1505 in malnourished hosts by evaluating its impact on the immuno-coagulative response. malnutrition significantly increased lung tissue damage caused by streptococcus pneumoniae infection. lung damage was associated with a deregulated activation of coagulation and an altered inflammatory response. pneumococcal colonization of lung and bacteremia were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in malnourished mice receiving the crl1505 strain. moreover, mice repleted with supplemental l. rhamnosus crl1505 showed the least alteration of the alveolar-capillary barrier and cell damage in lungs after the infectious challenge, especially when the crl1505 strain was administered by nasal route. besides, mice treated with l. rhamnosus crl1505 showed an improved respiratory innate immune response and a lower activation of coagulation. the results of this work indicate that l. rhamnosus crl1505 is able to beneficially modulate the inflammation-coagulation interaction after respiratory infections in malnourished hosts.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

AB  == background: colonization of the nasopharynx by streptococcus pneumoniae is considered a prerequisite for pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia and otitis media. probiotic bacteria can influence disease outcomes through various mechanisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization. here, we examine the effect of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) on s. pneumoniae colonization of human epithelial cells using an in vitro model. we investigated the effects of lgg administered before, at the same time as, or after the addition of s. pneumoniae on the adherence of four pneumococcal isolates. results: lgg significantly inhibited the adherence of all the pneumococcal isolates tested. the magnitude of inhibition varied with lgg dose, time of administration, and the pneumococcal isolate used. inhibition was most effective  when a higher dose of lgg was administered prior to establishment of pneumococcal colonization. mechanistic studies showed that lgg binds to epithelial cells but does not affect pneumococcal growth or viability. administration of lgg did not lead to any significant changes in host cytokine responses. conclusions: these findings demonstrate that lgg can inhibit pneumococcal colonization of human epithelial cells in vitro and suggest that probiotics could be used clinically to prevent the establishment of pneumococcal carriage.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: several studies have suggested that probiotics (prob) and/or prebiotics (preb) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. we aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with prob and preb could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (aom). methods: in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from november 2007 to april 2009, 37 pediatricians in france enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of aom who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with prob (streptococcus thermophilus ncc 2496, streptococcus salivarius dsm 13084, lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr cgmcc 1.3724) and preb (raftilose/raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). during 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of aom episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by  the poisson model (incidence rate ratio [irr]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% ci]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. results: we enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). all children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. in total, 486 aom episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. the treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of aom (irr 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (irr 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (irr = 1.0, 95% ci: 0.8-1.2). treatment was not associated with recurrent aom (odds ratio 1.0, 95% ci: 0.5-1.7). with regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. conclusion: the prob and preb included in follow-up formula given to children at  7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of aom, recurrent aom, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.

AB  == the ability of nasally administered lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 to accelerate the recovery of respiratory b cell-mediated immunity against pneumococcal infection in replete malnourished mice was evaluated. weaned mice were malnourished after consumption of a protein-free diet for 21 d. malnourished mice were fed a balanced conventional diet (bcd) for 7 d (bcd group) or a bcd for 7 d  with supplemental l. rhamnosus crl1505 by the nasal route during the last 2 d (bcd+lr group). nonreplete malnourished and normal mice were used as the malnourished (mnc) and the well-nourished (wnc) control groups, respectively. mice were challenged with streptococcus pneumoniae at the end of each dietary treatment. the immune response was studied before the challenge and at different  times postinfection. the mnc mice had less resistance to pneumococcal infection,  fewer mature and immature b cells in lung and spleen, and a reduced production of specific antibodies compared with wnc mice. the bcd treatment did not induce a complete normalization of the number b cell populations and antibody amounts. however, the bcd+lr group had normal numbers of spleen and lung b cells. moreover, the bcd+lr mice had a significantly lower susceptibility to s. pneumoniae infection and higher amounts of anti-pneumococcal antibodies. although further studies are necessary to clarify the effect of malnutrition and nasally administered lactobacilli in other immune cell populations involved in the protection against respiratory pathogens, this work gives evidence of the importance of using nasal priming with probiotics to accelerate the recovery of respiratory immunity in immunocompromised malnourished hosts.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

TI  == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == the viability and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion of probiotic strain combination--in vitro study.
AB  == to be effective, probiotic bacteria must exhibit a number of functional characteristics, including the resistance to gastric acidity and the ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. in this study, we examined in vitro the viability of lactic acid bacteria (lab) combination after exposure to low ph, and the adhesion of lab to caco-2 cells during coincubation of 9 bacterial strains. to test bacterial viability, 6 commercially available products were incubated in  0.1 n hcl at ph 1.2 for 60 min. the greatest growth inhibition was noted for the  non-capsulated product containing the lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (log reduction of cfu = 6.4), and the best survival observed for the product containing 9 bacterial strains, equipped with a modern capsule made according to  the multi-resistant encapsulation technology (log reduction of cfu = 0.1). in the adhesion experiment, the combination of 9 bacterial strains was added to 17-day-old caco-2 cell culture for 90 min. the greatest efficiency of adhesion was observed for the inoculum containing 5.5x10(8) cfu/ml/9.6 cm(2) of caco-2 and the dose of probiotic bacteria of 190 cells per one caco-2 cell. as a result, approximately 157 bacterial cells adhered to one caco-2 cell. the results indicate that the combination of 9 bacterial strains in the examined product is characterized as highly adhesive.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine, listerine and fluoride listerine mouthrinses on four putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of chlorhexidine (chx), listerine and fluoride listerine on putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm in the artificial mouth model. methods: a total of 24 human dentine discs were prepared. a biofilm composed of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii was cultured on the surfaces of human dentine discs in an artificial-mouth model. sucrose was supplied by computer-controlled release on a daily basis to simulate the real-life situation. three treatment reagents, chx, listerine and fluoride listerine, were supplied at a flow rate of 15 ml/h for 6 min twice a day. the dentine discs with biofilm were removed from the artificial mouth after being cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. the bacteria in the biofilm were analysed by plating on bhis agar and the colony-forming units of each species were counted. results: the total number of bacteria in the chx group was significantly lower than in the other three groups  (including control). there was no decline in the number of bacteria in the listerine group. s. mutans was reduced significantly in the chx group compared with the control group. the number and proportion of a. naeslundii in the chx group were significantly lower than in the other three groups. the proportion of  l. rhamnosus in the chx group was significantly higher than in the other three groups. conclusion: chx has the most significant effect on inhibition of the putative root-caries bacteria, with the exception of l. rhamnosus. both listerine and a combination of fluoride and listerine could not effectively reduce the numbers of bacteria in the biofilm. the effects of chx, listerine and fluoride listerine on root caries prevention need further investigation.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == synergistic effect between two bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by lactobacilli strains with inhibitory activity for streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are bacterial species that colonize the vagina in pregnant women and as such may cause serious infections in neonates that passed through the birth channel. the objective of this work was to study the inhibitory activities produced by each bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) of lactobacillus rhamnosus l60 and lactobacillus fermentum l23, and the effects of the combined blis-es of these lactobacilli on gbs. the interactions between the blis-es were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods on agar plates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (fics) were determined by a modification of the broth microdilution and checkerboard methods, respectively. antibiotic susceptibilities of all s. agalactiae strains were assayed and the results of these tests were evaluated for statistical significance. a 7.5% of gbs isolates were recovered from 760 pregnant women and 91% of those strains were susceptible to each blis produced by l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and also to a mixture of them. the comparisons among the blis-es showed statistically significant differences, with a combination of the blis-es from the two lactobacillus species being better than the blis of each one alone (p < 0.05) as gbs growth inhibitors. synergistic activities between the blis-es were found on 100% of susceptible gbs strains, mics ranges of blis of l23 and l60 were 80-160 and 160-320 ua ml(-1), respectively. by the checkerboard method, the blis-es combination showed synergistic effect on all sensitive strains tested, with values of fics ranging from 0.131 to 0.218. the blis-es produced by these lactobacilli of vaginal origin were able to inhibit s. agalactiae isolates. the results indicate that these strains may have probiotic potential for the control of gbs in women and may consequently prevent gbs infections in newborns.

TI  == probiotics can induce follicle maturational competence: the danio rerio case.
AB  == in the present study, the effects of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus imc 501 on the acquisition of oocyte maturational competence was examined in zebrafish (danio rerio). l. rhamnosus administration induced the responsiveness of incompetent follicles (stage iiia) to 17,20-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and their in vitro maturation. acquisition of competence by the stage iiia follicles  was further validated by changes of lhr, mprb, inhbaa (activin betaa1), tgfb1, and gdf9 gene expression, which have recently emerged as key regulators of oocyte acquisition of maturational competence, and pou5f1 gene expression, which in other models has been shown to govern the establishment of developmental competence of oocytes. in addition, a dna microarray experiment was conducted using the same follicles, and with relative gene ontology (go) data analysis, the molecular effects of probiotic administration emerged. molecular analysis using pcr-dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) approach, providing information about only the most abundant bacterial members of the microbial community, revealed that the probiotic was able to populate the gastrointestinal  tract and modulate the microbial communities, causing a clear shift in them and specifically enhancing the presence of the lactic acid bacteria streptococcus thermophilus. at the same time, pcr-dgge analysis revealed that the probiotic was not directly associated with the ovaries. finally, the effects of probiotic treatment on zebrafish follicle development were also analyzed by fpa (focal plane array) fourier transform-infrared (ft-ir) imaging, a technique that provides the overall biochemical composition of samples. changes were found above all in stage iiia follicles from probiotic-exposed females; the modifications, observed in protein secondary structures as well as in hydration and in bands related to phosphate moieties, allowed us to hypothesize that probiotics act at this follicle stage, affecting the maturation phase.

AB  == purpose: ethanol, human papilloma virus (hpv), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. streptococci sp and hpv infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. although hpv is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is  unclear whether there is a similar role for streptococci sp. this cell study examines whether streptococci sp and hpv-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (etoh) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. materials and methods: etoh (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate streptococci sp attachment with immortalized e6-expressing hpv/hok-16b cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. streptococci sp (streptococci mutans [lt11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (aa) producer and nonproducer streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). carcinogens, aa, malondialdehyde, dna damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. results: aa and malondialdehyde production from permissible streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas l rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. this attachment was associated with enhanced levels of aa adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by hpv oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. conclusions: these cell studies suggest that oral streptococci sp and hpv (hpv-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level etoh (1%) exposure. these results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == background: antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) via restoration of the gut microflora. antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and aad is common in this population. objectives: the primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of aad in children. search methods: medline, embase, central, cinahl, amed, and the web of science (inception to may 2010) were searched along with specialized registers including the cochrane ibd/fbd review group, ciscom (centralized information service for complementary medicine), nhs evidence, the international bibliographic information on dietary supplements as well as trial registries. letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. conference proceedings,  dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched. selection criteria: randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.  data collection and analysis: study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled relative risk and risk difference (adverse events), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. for overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. to explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, antibiotic agent as well as risk of bias. main results: sixteen studies (3432 participants) met the inclusion criteria. trials included treatment with either bacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., lactobacilli spp., lactococcus spp.,  leuconostoc cremoris, saccharomyces spp., or streptococcus spp., alone or in combination. nine studies used a single strain probiotic agent, four combined two probiotic strains, one combined three probiotic strains, one product included ten probiotic agents, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. the risk of bias was determined to be high in 8 studies and low in 8 studies. available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 15/16 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a large, precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. the incidence of aad in the probiotic group was 9% compared to 18% in the control group (2874 participants; rr 0.52; 95% ci 0.38 to 0.72; i(2) = 56%). this benefit was not statistically significant  in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) intention to treat (itt) sensitivity analysis. the incidence of aad in the probiotic group was 16% compared to 18% in the control group (3392 participants; rr 0.81; 95% ci 0.63 to  1.04; i(2) = 59%). an a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (>/=5 billion cfus/day) is more effective  than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion cfus/day), interaction p value = 0.010. for  the high dose studies the incidence of aad in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 22% in the control group (1474 participants; rr 0.40; 95% ci 0.29 to 0.55). for the low dose studies the incidence of aad in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 11% in the control group (1382 participants; rr 0.80; 95% ci 0.53 to  1.21). an extreme plausible itt subgroup analysis was marginally significant for  high dose probiotics. for the high dose studies the incidence of aad in the probiotic group was 17% compared to 22% in the control group (1776 participants;  rr 0.72; 95% ci 0.53 to 0.99; i(2) = 58%). none of the 11 trials (n = 1583) that  reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events. meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events  between treatment and control (rd 0.00; 95% ci -0.01 to 0.02). authors' conclusions: despite heterogeneity in probiotic strain, dose, and duration, as well as in study quality, the overall evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing aad. using 11 criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate that the subgroup effect based on dose (>/=5 billion cfu/day) was credible. based on high-dose probiotics, the number needed to treat (nnt) to prevent one case of diarrhea is seven (nnt 7; 95% ci 6 to 10). however, a grade analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary endpoint (incidence of diarrhea)  was low due to issues with risk of bias (due to high loss to follow-up) and imprecision (sparse data, 225 events). the benefit for high dose probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus or saccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed randomized trial. more refined trials are also needed that test strain specific probiotics and evaluate the efficacy (e.g. incidence and duration of diarrhea) and safety of probiotics with limited losses to follow-up.  it is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric aad. future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure aad.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == microchip electrophoresis of bacteria using lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles.
AB  == the aggregation and adhesion of bacterial cells is a serious disadvantage for electrophoretic separations of bacteria. in this study, lipid-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles were used as a pseudostationary phase to minimise the bacterial aggregation and adsorption to the inner walls of microchannels. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus rhamnosus were selected as analytes and were separated by microchip electrophoresis (mce) with laser-induced fluorescence (lif) detection using 4.5 mm tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (tris)-4.5 mm boric acid-0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate (edta) (tbe) containing poly(ethylene oxide) (peo) and lipid-based nanoparticles as the running buffer. the mechanism of lipid-based nanoparticles affecting bacterial adhesion and aggregation was discussed and supported by zeta potential experiments. under the optimal conditions, the three  species of bacteria were identified with patterned peaks. this proposed mce method using lipid-based nanoparticles as running buffer additives was also used  to analyse a real yogurt sample, and valuable bacterial information was obtained  by the electropherograms.

TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci counts in  indian children.
AB  == aim: probiotics and their effect on oral health have been a focus of numerous trials in recent times. no documented trials have been reported from developing countries such as india with its focus on probiotic use, especially in the paediatric population. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci (ms) counts of children using the two  commercially and widely available preparations and to explore their anti-caries potential. study design: a placebo controlled study was undertaken with 3 parallel arms comprising a total of 150 healthy children (7-14 years). the subjects were randomly divided into the groups (each comprising 50 children): group a - placebo powder, group b - a freeze dried powdered combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium species, group c - a freeze dried powdered preparation of bacillus coagulans. the subjects were instructed to mix the preparation in 20 ml of water and to follow a swish and swallow method for 14 days. mutans streptococci colony counts per ml of saliva were performed on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar collected on the first day and 14 days post-intervention. results: a statistically significant reduction (p<0.001) in salivary mutans streptococci counts was recorded in both groups b and c after 14  days of probiotic ingestion. conclusion: a cost-effective probiotic such as bacillus coagulans might be a subject for further research for prevention of caries in children.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == short-term consumption of probiotic lactobacilli has no effect on acid production of supragingival plaque.
AB  == acidogenicity and the levels of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental plaque after the use of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and lactobacillus reuteri were determined. the study had a randomised, double-blind, crossover design. thirteen  volunteers used tablets containing lgg or a combination of l. reuteri sd2112 and  pta 5289 for 2 weeks. at baseline and at the end of each tablet period, all available supragingival plaque was collected. lactic acid production was determined from a fixed volume (8 mul) of fresh plaque and the rest of the plaque was used for culturing ms and lactobacilli. the retention of probiotics to the plaque was assessed using pcr techniques. no probiotic-induced changes were found in the acidogenicity of plaque. also, ms counts remained at the original level. the number of subjects with lactobacilli in plaque increased in the l. reuteri group (p = 0.011) but not in the lgg group. pcr analysis of plaque revealed the presence of lgg in four and l. reuteri in six subjects after the use of the probiotic. the use of the lactobacilli did not affect the acidogenicity or ms levels of plaque. short-term consumption of lgg and l. reuteri appeared not to influence the acidogenicity of plaque.

TI  == extension of tosela cheese shelf-life using non-starter lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == six strains of non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were used to extend the shelf-life of the fresh cheese tosela manufactured with pasteurised cows' milk. the acidification kinetics of three lactobacillus paracasei, one lactobacillus rhamnosus and two streptococcus macedonicus were studied in synthetic milk medium. lb. paracasei ndp78 and ndp88 and s. macedonicus ndp1 and pb14-1 showed an interesting acidifying capacity and were further characterised for growth in uht milk and production of antimicrobial compounds. lb. paracasei ndp78 and s. macedonicus ndp1 grew more than 2 log cycles in 6 h. lb. paracasei ndp78 was also found to produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) active against listeria monocytogenes. the four nslab strains (singly or in combination) were used to produce experimental pilot-scale cheeses which were compared by a panel.  the cheese manufactured with the mixed culture lb. paracasei ndp78 - s. macedonicus ndp1 was the most appreciated for its sensory properties. the cheeses produced at factory-scale showed higher concentrations of lactobacilli (7.90 log  cfu/g) and streptococci (6.10 log cfu/g), but a lower development of coliforms (3.10 log cfu/g) and staphylococci (2.78 log cfu/g) than control cheese (4.86, 4.89, 4.93 and 5.00 log cfu/g of lactobacilli, streptococci, coliforms and staphylococci, respectively) processed without nslab addition. the food pathogens salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes were never detected. the dominance of  the species inoculated was demonstrated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), whereas strain recognition was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr. from the results obtained, lb. paracasei ndp78 and s. macedonicus ndp1 were able to persist during the storage of tosela cheese and their combination influenced positively the sensory characteristics and shelf-life of the final product.

TI  == reversal of primary root caries lesions after daily intake of milk supplemented with fluoride and probiotic lactobacilli in older adults.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of milk supplemented with fluoride and/or probiotic bacteria on primary root caries lesions (prcl) in older adults. materials and methods: after informed consent, 160 healthy subjects, 58-84 years  of age, with at least two prcl were recruited and randomly assigned to one of four parallel study groups drinking 200 ml milk once daily for 15 months. group a consumed standard milk (placebo); group b ingested milk supplemented with 5 ppm f and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21, 10(7) cfu/ml); group c drank milk with only probiotic bacteria and group d milk contained only fluoride. primary endpoints were root caries index (rci) and electric resistance measurements (ecm) carried out by one blinded single examiner. secondary endpoints were mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts in saliva and plaque estimated with chair-side tests. data were compared within and between groups with non-parametric tests. results: the drop out rate was 38%. at baseline there  were no statistical differences between the groups. significantly higher numbers  of rci reversals were found in groups b, c and d compared with group a (p < 0.05). the mean ecm values increased significantly (p < 0.05) in all groups except for the placebo group a, indicating that remineralization occurred. the effect was most beneficial in the two groups that contained fluoride. no significant alterations were displayed regarding the microbial counts. no severe  adverse effects were reported during intervention. conclusion: daily intake of milk supplemented with fluoride and/or probiotic bacteria may reverse soft and leathery prcl in older adults.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus thermophilus induce suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (socs3) gene expression directly and indirectly via interleukin-10 in human primary macrophages.
AB  == in the present study we have characterized t helper type 2 (th2) [interleukin (il)-10]/th1 (il-12) cytokine expression balance in human primary macrophages stimulated with multiple non-pathogenic gram-positive bacteria used in the food industry and as probiotic substances. bacteria representing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, leuconostoc, propionibacterium and streptococcus species induced anti-inflammatory il-10 production, although quantitative differences between the bacteria were observed. s. thermophilus was able to induce il-12 production, while the production of il-12 induced by other bacteria  remained at a low level. the highest anti-inflammatory potential was seen with bifidobacteria, as evidenced by high il-10/il-12 induction ratios. all studied non-pathogenic bacteria were able to stimulate the expression of suppressor of cytokine signalling (socs) 3 that controls the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. lactobacillus and streptococcus species induced socs3 mrna expression directly in the absence of protein synthesis and indirectly via bacteria-induced il-10 production, as demonstrated by experiments with cycloheximide (chx) and anti-il-10 antibodies, respectively. the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38 signalling pathway played a key role  in bacteria-induced socs3 gene expression. enhanced il-10 production and socs3 gene expression induced by live non-pathogenic lactobacillus and streptococcus is also likely to contribute to their immunoregulatory effects in vivo.

TI  == modulation of intestinal morphology and immunity in nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus) by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria from human origins as a potential probiotic supplementation in aquaculture feed is now widely accepted. here, we examined some of the properties and mechanisms of the action of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, originating from humans, on growth performance, gut mucosal immunity and humoral and cellular immune response in tilapia (oreochromis niloticus). the results suggested that supplementation of l. rhamnosus gave an advantage in promoting the intestinal structure and the mucosal immunity of tilapia. probiotic fish had a greater villous height in all parts of the intestines and, significantly, in the proximal and middle part. the population of intraepithelial lymphocytes was significantly higher in the probiotic group than in the control group in all parts of the intestines. the population of acidophilic granulocyte in the probiotic group was significantly higher at the proximal and distal parts  when compared with the control group. the higher serum complement activity as well as the enhanced phagocytosis and killing ability of the head kidney leukocytes in the probiotic supplemented fish corresponded with the higher level  of tnf alpha and il-1 gene expression, suggesting that the induction of il-1 and  tnf alpha cytokines by l. rhamnosus served as an important regulator of gut associated immune systems.

TI  == effects of compounds found in nidus vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == nidus vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) chemical extraction of nidus vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans. in this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the nidus vespae chl/meoh extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the  acid inhibition properties, anti-f-atpase activity and anti-ldh activity against  s. mutans. the isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. in addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-mic levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity  of s. mutans cells. treated with the test agents, the f-atpase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. the results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in chl/meoh extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that nidus vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.

TI  == metabolism of l-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. we investigated the metabolism of l-selenomethionine (semet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with semet and selenite in rats. when semet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (streptococcus salivarius k12, lactobacillus rhamnosus 67b, lactobacillus acidophilus l10, and bifidobacterium lactis lafti(r) b94) at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of semet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (dmdse) and dimethylselenide  (dmse). in similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to dmse and dmdse accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either semet or  selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or semet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (semet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. probiotic treated rats given semet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given semet. thus, treatment with probiotics followed  by semet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.

TI  == coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ros). antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase (cat), can protect against ros by eliminating superoxide and h(2)o(2), respectively. lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both sod and cat, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. to confer high level of oxidative resistance on l. rhamnosus , the sod gene soda from streptococcus thermophilus and cat gene kata from l. sakei were coexpressed in l. rhamnosus as 1.2466. the enzyme activities of sod and cat were 147.80 +/- 1.08 u/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of h(2)o(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant l. rhamnosus cs. after incubation with 10 mm h(2)o(2), the survival ratio of l. rhamnosus cs was 400-fold higher than that of l. rhamnosus cat. in long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of l. rhamnosus cs remained approximately 10(6) cfu/ml after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of  the control were detected. these results showed that the cooperation between sod  and cat could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in l. rhamnosus . to our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same lactobacilli.

AB  == objective: co-aggregation and growth inhibition abilities of probiotic bacteria may play a key role in their interference with the oral biofilm. the aim was to investigate the in vitro ability of selected commercial probiotic lactobacilli to co-aggregate and inhibit growth of oral mutans steptococci isolated from adults with contrasting levels of caries. materials and methods: mutans streptococci (ms) strains were isolated from caries-free (n = 3) and caries-susceptible (n = 5) young adults and processed with eight commercial probiotic lactobacilli strains. one laboratory reference strain (s. mutans ingbritt) was selected as control. co-aggregation was determined spectrophotometrically and growth inhibition was assessed with the agar overlay technique. results: all probiotic lactobacilli showed an ability to co-aggregate with the isolated ms strains. statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between strains from  different individuals when compared with the reference strain. the selected lactobacilli inhibited ms growth, but the ability varied between the strains and  was clearly related to ph. no differences were observed between the different ms  strains from caries-free and caries-susceptible individuals. conclusions: the selected lactobacilli displayed co-aggregation activity and inhibited growth of clinical mutans streptococci. the growth inhibition was strain-specific and dependent on ph and cell concentration. the findings indicate that the outcome of lactobacilli-derived probiotic therapy might vary between individuals and depend  on the specific strain used.

AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.

TI  == use of lactulose as prebiotic and its influence on the growth, acidification profile and viable counts of different probiotics in fermented skim milk.
AB  == lactulose can be considered as a prebiotic, which is able to stimulate healthy intestinal microflora. in the present work, the use of this ingredient in fermented milk improved quality of skim milk fermented by lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and bifidobacterium lactis in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus. compared to control fermentations without lactulose, the addition of such a prebiotic in skim milk increased the counts of all probiotics, with particular concern to b. lactis (bifidogenic effect), the acidification rate and the lactic acid acidity, and concurrently reduced the time to complete fermentation (t(ph4.5)) and the ph at the end of cold storage for 1 to 35 days.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg on saliva-derived microcosms.
AB  == objective: the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) is shown to hamper the presence of mutans streptococci in saliva and may have positive effects on oral health. we investigated the effects of lgg on the cariogenic potential and microbial composition of saliva-derived microcosms. design: single  and dual species biofilms of lgg and streptococcus mutans, and saliva-derived microcosms with or without lgg were grown in an active attachment biofilm model.  the microcosms were grown on bovine dentin/enamel discs in the presence or absence of sucrose (suc+/suc-). the presence of lgg was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) and real-time pcr. mutans streptococci (ms) and total viable counts, ph of the spent medium, capacity of lactate formation and integrated mineral loss in dentin was assessed. mlpa was used for identification and relative quantification of 20 oral microorganisms in  the microcosms. principal component analysis was applied to mlpa data. results: lgg inhibited the growth of s. mutans in dual species biofilms and did not affect the ph. lgg established in saliva-derived microcosms and reduced ms counts significantly, but did not affect ph or dentin demineralization. simultaneous growth of the microcosms with lgg under heavy cariogenic conditions (suc+) introduced a compositional shift in the microbial community. the cfu, real-time pcr and mlpa data correlated significantly. conclusion: we conclude that lgg established into and inhibited the growth of ms in complex saliva-derived biofilms, but this had no significant effect on cariogenic potential of the microcosms. this suggests that other microorganisms besides ms were responsible for increased cariogenicity of sucrose-exposed biofilms.

TI  == probiotic lactobacilli interfere with streptococcus mutans biofilm formation in vitro.
AB  == in clinical studies, probiotic bacteria have decreased the counts of salivary mutans streptococci (ms). we compared the effects of probiotic lactobacillus strains on the biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans. the bacterial strains used included four s. mutans strains (reference strains nctc 10449 and ingbritt and clinical isolates 2366 and 195) and probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. reuteri strains pta 5289 and sd2112. the ability of ms to adhere and grow on a glass surface, reflecting biofilm formation, was studied in the presence of the lactobacilli (lb). the effect of lb culture supernatants on the viability of the ms was studied as well. all of the lb inhibited the biofilm formation of the clinical isolates of ms (p < 0.001). the biofilm formation of the reference strains of ms was also inhibited by the lb, but l. plantarum and l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a weaker inhibition when compared to l. reuteri sd2112 and l. rhamnosus gg. viable s. mutans cells could be detected in the biofilms and culture media only when the experiments were performed with the l. reuteri strains. the l. reuteri strains were less efficient in killing the ms also in the tests performed with the culture supernatants. the  phs of the supernatants of l. reuteri were higher compared to those of l. rhamnosus gg and l. plantarum; p < 0.001. in conclusion, our results demonstrated that four commonly used probiotics interfered with s. mutans biofilm formation in vitro, and that the antimicrobial activity against s. mutans was ph-dependent.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral mutans streptococci and candida by commercial probiotic lactobacilli--an in vitro study.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are suggested to play a role in the maintenance of oral health. such health promoting bacteria are added to different commercial probiotic products. the aim of the study was to investigate the ability of a selection of lactobacilli strains, used in commercially available probiotic products, to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and c. albicans in vitro. methods: eight probiotic lactobacilli strains were tested for growth inhibition on three reference strains and two clinical isolates of mutans streptococci as well as two reference strains and three clinical isolates of candida albicans with an agar overlay method. results: at concentrations ranging from 109 to 105 cfu/ml, all lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth of the mutans streptococci  completely with the exception of l. acidophilus la5 that executed only a slight inhibition of some strains at concentrations corresponding to 107 and 105 cfu/ml. at the lowest cell concentration (103 cfu/ml), only l. plantarum 299v and l. plantarum 931 displayed a total growth inhibition while a slight inhibition was seen for all five mutans streptococci strains by l. rhamnosus lb21, l. paracasei  f19, l. reuteri pta 5289 and l. reuteri atcc 55730. all the tested lactobacilli strains reduced candida growth but the effect was generally weaker than for mutans streptococci. the two l. plantarum strains and l. reuteri atcc 55730 displayed the strongest inhibition on candida albicans. no significant differences were observed between the reference strains and the clinical isolates. conclusion: the selected probiotic strains showed a significant but somewhat varying ability to inhibit growth of oral mutans streptococci and candida albicans in vitro.

TI  == immunomodulatory activity of lactobacillus rhamnosus strains isolated from goat milk: impact on intestinal and respiratory infections.
AB  == the immune stimulation induced by lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 (lr05) and l. rhamnosus crl1506 (lr06) on the resistance to infection with an intestinal pathogen (salmonella typhimurium) and a respiratory pathogen (streptococcus pneumoniae) was studied in swiss-albine mice experimental models. the cytokine profiles that induced the innate and specific immune response in both infectious  processes were investigated. both strains were able to improve resistance against the intestinal pathogen. only lr05 was able to induce a significant decrease in the number of s. pneumoniae in the lung, prevent its dissemination into the blood and induce a significant increase in th1 (inf-gamma) and th2 (il-6, il-4 and il-10) cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (bal). the changes in the cytokines profiles in bal were associated with an increase in the number and activity of phagocytic cells and with the increase in specific antibodies in serum and bal, which would explain the increased resistance to the challenge. the administration of lr06 did not induce significant effects at the respiratory mucosal level. the results described in the present paper showed that certain lab strains can share certain functional properties, although some of them can perform a functional role better than others, so that it is important to perform  careful studies on specific strains, according to their therapeutic use.

TI  == [establishment and evaluation of the in vitro dynamic biofilm model].
AB  == purpose: to establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. methods: the fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. four strains of oral bacteria, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. the hydroxyapatite (ha) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. the temperature, oxide pressure, ph, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. distilled water and 25mm sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. at the beginning  of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. after the growth of  bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was  inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). the organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. when the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. the ha discs and glass slides  were observed every 24 hours for five times. the data was analyzed using spss 10.0 software package. dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. results: the dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. with the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. conclsuions: the model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. the model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.

TI  == pecorino crotonese cheese: study of bacterial population and flavour compounds.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == pategras cheese as a suitable carrier for six probiotic cultures.
AB  == the viability of five single-strain and one three-strain probiotic cultures was assessed during pategras cheese ripening. probiotics were inoculated into cheese-milk after a pre-incubation step - intended to improve their survival - or directly as a lyophilised culture; control cheeses without probiotics were also obtained. ph of probiotic and control cheeses was similar, except in probiotic cheeses containing the strain lb. acidophilus b or the mixed culture. in these cases, the probiotic cheeses were more acid than their respective control cheeses. all the probiotics tested maintained counts above 107 cfu/g during the shelf-life settled for the product. strains of the lb. casei group: lb. paracasei, lb. casei and lb. rhamnosus reached and kept the highest cell concentration during cheese ripening, followed by lb. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. the direct addition of the probiotic cultures was more efficient  than their inoculation after a pre-incubation step, for all the probiotics assayed. we have provided evidence that support the use of pategras cheese as a performing food-based vehicle for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == specific lactobacillus/mutans streptococcus co-aggregation.
AB  == selective interaction of mutans streptococci with benign bacteria could present an opportunity for their removal from the mouth without disruption of other oral  flora. this study was conducted to find probiotic lactobacilli that could specifically co-aggregate in vitro with mutans streptococci, but not with other plaque commensals. a search of 624 lactobacilli among a large culture library revealed 6 strains, all classifiable as l. paracasei or l. rhamnosus, which met this criterion. such novel, specific co-aggregation, however, was not a general characteristic of these species or the genus lactobacillus. the co-aggregation by these specific lactobacilli was characterized as heat treatment (autoclaving)- and protease-resistant, lectin-independent, not inactivated by sugar substitutes, operational over a wide ph range, unaffected by whole saliva, but calcium-dependent. it is thus seen to present a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

AB  == this clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. after a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized  crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. the 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of amf/snf(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants  either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an amf/snf(2) mouthwash. in the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. the microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard dna:dna hybridization. a statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of dna of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in  the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having  used the amf/snf(2) toothpaste + amf/snf(2) mouthrinsing. the results indicate that using the amf/snf(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == probiotics.
AB  == the term "probiotic" was first used in 1965, by lilly and stillwell, to describe  substances secreted by one organism which stimulate the growth of another. the use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy and irradiation, amongst other means of treatment, may cause alterations in the composition and have an effect on the git flora. therefore, the introduction of beneficial bacterial species to  gi tract may be a very attractive option to re-establish the microbial equilibrium and prevent disease. prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient that confers benefits on the host by selectively stimulating one bacterium or a group of bacteria in the colon with probiotic properties. both probiotics and prebiotics are together called as synbiotics. various bacterial genera most commonly used in probiotic preparations are lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, escherichia, enterococcus, bacillus and streptococcus . some fungal strains belonging to saccharomyces have also been used. probiotics have been shown to be  effective in varied clinical conditions- ranging from infantile diarrhoea, necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, relapsing clostridium difficle colitis, helicobacter pylori infections, inflammatory bowel disease to cancer, female uro-genital infection and surgical infections. lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg has proven beneficial affects on intestinal immunity. it increases the number of iga and other immunoglobulins secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa. it also stimulates local release of interferons. it facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid cells, which serves to increase antigen uptake in peyer's patches. probiotics are live microorganisms, so it is possible that they may result in infection in the host. the risk and morbidity of sepsis due to probiotic bacteria should be weighed against the potential for sepsis due to more pathological bacteria and the morbidity of diseases for which probiotic bacteria are being used as therapeutic agents. also, future, well-designed placebo controlled studies with validated results are required for ascertaining the true health benefits of probiotics the important point in this regard is careful selection of the probiotic agent, its dose standardization and a thorough knowledge of its beneficial effects.

AB  == background: for some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. in this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. results: heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. these include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacilllus brevis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, streptococcus entericus and lactococcus garviae. the increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxa, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. conclusion: we propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes  among the species.

TI  == spr1630 is responsible for the lethality of clpx mutations in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the clp protease atpase subunit and chaperone clpx is dispensable in some bacteria, but it is thought to be essential in others, including streptococci and lactococci. we confirm that clpx is essential in the rx strain of streptococcus pneumoniae but show that the requirement for clpx can be relieved by point mutations, frame shifts, or deletion of the gene spr1630, which is found in many  isolates of s. pneumoniae. homologs occur frequently in staphylococcus aureus as  well as in a few strains of listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus johnsonii, and  lactobacillus rhamnosus. in each case, the spr1630 homolog is accompanied by a putative transcriptional regulator with an hth dna binding motif. in s. pneumoniae, the spr1630-spr1629 gene pair, accompanied by a rup element, occurs as an island inserted between the trpa and ccla genes in 15 of 22 sequenced genomes.

AB  == aim: the aim of the study was to evaluate the adhesion of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg to saliva-coated surfaces in vitro. methods: fifteen radiolabeled dairy l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains and l. rhamnosus gg were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and polystyrene microtiter plates and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter. the effects of lysozyme on the adhesion of lactobacilli and of pretreatment with lactobacilli on the adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis were also assessed. results: all strains tested adhered to saliva-coated surfaces but  with significantly different binding frequencies. the adhesion of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strains remained lower in comparison to l. rhamnosus strain gg. one l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain showed binding frequency comparable to s. sanguinis. lysozyme pretreatment of the samples significantly increased lactobacillus adhesion to saliva-coated surfaces. conclusion: the present results showed significant variations in the adhesion capacity of the lactobacillus strains studied. adhesion to oral surfaces is of primary importance for bacterial colonization in the mouth. only one of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dairy starter culture strains investigated had a high adhesion percentage. this strain might then be considered for further investigations in the oral environment.

TI  == final ph affects the interference capacity of naturally occurring oral lactobacillus strains against mutans streptococci.
AB  == objectives: to establish the effects of three factors: previous caries experience; colonization of streptococcus mutans; and final ph on autologous lactobacilli-mediated inhibition against a panel of mutans streptococci in young  subjects with different caries experiences. design: the inhibition capacity was determined by the use of the agar overlay method and the final ph in culture medium was measured after 20 h. using a logistic regression model, the risk of having an incomplete lactobacilli-mediated inhibition was calculated. results: all three factors significantly influenced the interference outcome in the order; final ph of the lactobacillus strains, oral colonization of autologous s. mutans  and caries experience. a high risk occurred at a lower ph and at a wider ph range for individuals with previous caries experience and autologous colonization of s. mutans compared with caries-free subjects who were not colonized. at a final ph of 4.0, this risk was approximately eight times higher than that of the latter group. two mutans streptococcus strains in the test panel demonstrated high individual predictive values of inhibition mediated by oral lactobacilli. conclusions: generation of a low ph either directly via organic acid production and/or production of bacteriocins or metabolites at a low ph may promote mutans streptococcus growth inhibition, in vitro. furthermore, a shift of ph range for the risk of incomplete inhibition of mutans streptococci suggests a less effective inhibition at a wider ph range for naturally occurring lactobacilli from individuals with earlier caries experience containing own s. mutans.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg inhibits invasion of cultured human respiratory cells  by prtf1-positive macrolide-resistant group a streptococci.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to determine whether the probiotic strain lactobacillus gg, which is extensively used in the treatment and prevention of intestinal disorders, is able to inhibit invasion of cultured human respiratory cells by macrolide-resistant group a streptococci (gas) carrying the prtf1 gene,  which encodes the fibronectin (fn)-binding invasin f1. methods and results: eight prtf1-positive erythromycin-resistant gas strains were used to infect a549 monolayers in competition and displacement assays with lactobacillus gg. live (l-lgg) and heat-killed (hk-lgg) lactobacilli and their spent culture supernatant (scs) significantly reduced (p < 0.001) gas invasion efficiency in both assays. no antibacterial activity of lactobacillus gg against gas was detected. both l-lgg and hk-lgg and all prtf1-positive gas induced a strong agglutination reaction using fn-coated particles. conclusions: lactobacillus gg exerts an antagonistic action against gas by inhibiting cell invasion. competitive binding  of lactobacillus gg and gas to fn might be involved in the inhibition process. significance and impact of the study: the finding that lactobacillus gg can prevent in vitro invasion of respiratory cells by gas suggests new applications for this probiotic strain and warrants further studies of its capacity to prevent gas throat infections.

AB  == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific  media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not  only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance  of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

TI  == microarray analysis of the microflora of root caries in elderly.
AB  == the present study used a new 16s rrna-based microarray with probes for over 300 bacterial species to better define the bacterial profiles of healthy root surfaces and root caries (rc) in the elderly. supragingival plaque was collected  from 20 healthy subjects (controls) and from healthy and carious roots and carious dentin from 21 rc subjects (patients). collectively, 179 bacterial species and species groups were detected. a higher bacterial diversity was observed in controls than in patients. lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus were notably associated with most rc samples.  streptococcus mutans was detected more frequently in the infected dentin than in  the other samples, but the difference was not significant. actinomyces was found  more frequently in controls. thus, species other than actinomyces and s. mutans may play a role as pathogens of rc. the results from this study were in general agreement with those of our previous study based on 16s rrna gene sequencing.

TI  == effect of different prebiotics on the fermentation kinetics, probiotic survival and fatty acids profiles in nonfat symbiotic fermented milk.
AB  == the simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium lactis with streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. in particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (ph, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (cla) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees c for 24 h. fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. all probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these b. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by s. thermophilus-l. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.

TI  == anticaries effect of compounds extracted from galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == introduction: galla chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of galla chinensis and its chemical fractions. methods: a four-organism bacterial consortium (streptococcus sanguis,  streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown  on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. galla chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed  into different flow cells. the ph value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the ha discs were counted. enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. the biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. results: when galla chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase ph remained higher than that  in the sucrose alone. a lower level of colonization on the ha surface was also observed in the groups to which galla chinensis and fluoride were added compared  with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less  compact biofilm, respectively. enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the galla chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. conclusions: galla chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. galla chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents  that may prevent dental caries.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  == the effect of nonstarter lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. the kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional swiss cheese making, is used by many american cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter lactobacillus strains previously isolated from swiss cheeses, lactobacillus casei a26, l. casei b21, and lactobacillus rhamnosus h2, as an adjunct. control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. adjunct strain l. casei a26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. there were no significant differences in propionibacterium counts, streptococcus  thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and ph among the cheeses. free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with l. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct l. casei strains, but not with adjunct l. rhamnosus. cheeses made with l. casei a26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. the 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. adjunct lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. use of adjunct lactobacillus cultures provides swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.

TI  == live lactobacillus rhamnosus and streptococcus pyogenes differentially regulate toll-like receptor (tlr) gene expression in human primary macrophages.
AB  == macrophages are phagocytes that recognize bacteria and subsequently activate appropriate innate and adaptive immune responses. tlrs are essential in identifying conserved bacterial structures and in initiating and mediating innate immune responses. in this work, we have characterized tlr gene expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages in response to stimulation with two live gram-positive bacteria, a human commensal and probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and an important human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. lgg and s. pyogenes enhanced tlr2 expression in macrophages. lgg and s. pyogenes also required tlr2 for nf-kappab activation. only pathogenic s. pyogenes was able to up-regulate tlr3 and tlr7 gene expression. this up-regulation was dependent on ifn-alpha/beta, as neutralizing anti-ifn-alpha/beta antibodies reduced s. pyogenes-induced tlr3 and tlr7 mrna expression. our results show that despite similarities, tlr responses of macrophages differ for a gram-positive probiotic and a pathogen. our data suggest that macrophages can discriminate between probiotic and pathogenic bacteria by ifn-mediated tlr gene regulation.

TI  == antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic  strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the  different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == characterization and site-directed mutagenesis of wzb, an o-phosphatase from lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == background: reversible phosphorylation events within a polymerisation complex have been proposed to modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae. similar phosphatase and kinase genes are present in the exopolysaccharide (eps) biosynthesis loci of numerous lactic acid bacteria genomes. results: the protein sequence deduced from the wzb gene in lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 9595 reveals four motifs of the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (php) superfamily of prokaryotic o-phosphatases. native and modified  his-tag fusion wzb proteins were purified from escherichia coli cultures. extracts showed phosphatase activity towards tyrosine-containing peptides. the purified fusion protein wzb was active on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (pnpp), with an optimal activity in presence of bovine serum albumin (bsa 1%) at ph 7.3 and a temperature of 75 degrees c. at 50 degrees c, residual activity decreased to 10 %. copper ions were essential for phosphatase activity, which was significantly increased by addition of cobalt. mutated fusion wzb proteins exhibited reduced phosphatase activity on p-nitrophenyl-phosphate. however, one variant (c6s) showed close to 20% increase in phosphatase activity. conclusion: these characteristics reveal significant differences with the manganese-dependent cpsb  protein tyrosine phosphatase described for streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with the polysaccharide-related phosphatases of gram negative bacteria.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == yogurt containing probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 helps resolve moderate diarrhea and increases cd4 count in hiv/aids patients.
AB  == hiv/aids is changing the human landscape in sub-saharan africa. relatively few patients receive antiretroviral therapy, and many suffer from debilitating diarrhea that affects their quality of life. given the track record of probiotics to alleviate diarrhea, conventional yogurt fermented with lactobacillus delbruekii var bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus was supplemented with probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14. twenty-four hiv/aids adult female patients (18 to 44 y) with clinical signs of moderate diarrhea, cd4  counts over 200, and not receiving antiretrovirals or dietary supplements, consumed either 100 ml supplemented or unsupplemented yogurt per day for 15 days. hematologic profiles, cd4 cell counts, and quality of life was evaluated at baseline, 15 and 30 days postprobiotic-yogurt feeding. there was no significant alteration in the hematologic parameters of both groups before and after the probiotic-yogurt feeding. the probiotic yogurt group at baseline, 15 and 30 days  had a mean wbc count of 5.8+/-0.76 x 10(9)/l, 6.0+/-1.02 x 10(9)/l, and 5.4+/-0.14 x 10(9)/l, respectively. however, the mean cd4 cell count remained the same or increased at 15 and 30 days in 11/12 probiotic-treated subjects compared  to 3/12 in the control. diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea resolved in 12/12 probiotic-treated subjects within 2 days, compared to 2/12 receiving yogurt for 15 days. this is the first study to show the benefits of probiotic yogurt on quality of life of women in nigeria with hiv/aids, and suggests that perhaps a simple fermented food can provide some relief in the management of the aids epidemic in africa.

TI  == heat- and formalin-inactivated probiotic bacteria induce comparable cytokine patterns in intestinal epithelial cell-leucocyte cocultures.
AB  == the mode of inactivation of probiotic bacteria may profoundly affect their immune-modulatory properties to the point of reversal of effects in in vitro human intestinal epithelial-like cell cultures (caco-2). to further investigate the influence of inactivation treatment on cytokine production, three probiotic strains were evaluated-live, heat-inactivated, and formalin-inactivated strains-for their impact on interleukin (il) 6, il-8, and il-10 production in caco-2-leucocyte cocultures. the tested bacteria induced strain-specific production of il-6, il-8, and il-10. no suppressive effects on cytokine synthesis were observed. live microorganisms seemed to be slightly more potent inducers of  cytokine production than nonviable strains, but differences to inactivated bacteria were not statistically significant. our results indicate that heat and formalin treatments of probiotic microorganisms are equivalent inactivation methods in terms of induction of il-6, il-8, and il-10 production in caco-2-peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultures and do not invert immune-modulatory effects.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

TI  == lactobacillus-mediated interference of mutans streptococci in caries-free vs. caries-active subjects.
AB  == in order to assess whether naturally occurring oral lactobacilli have probiotic properties, lactobacilli were isolated from saliva and plaque from children and adolescents, with or without caries lesions. the interference capacities of these lactobacilli were investigated against a panel of 13 clinical isolates and reference strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as  against the subject's autologous mutans streptococci, using the agar-overlay technique. lactobacillus-mediated inhibition differed significantly between the three subject groups (no caries, arrested caries, or active caries), demonstrating increased inhibition in subjects without present or previous caries experience compared to subjects with arrested caries or subjects presenting with  frank lesions. lactobacilli from subjects lacking s. mutans inhibited the growth  of the test panel of mutans streptococci significantly better than lactobacilli from subjects who were colonized. furthermore, subjects without caries experience harbored lactobacilli that more effectively repressed the growth of their autologous mutans streptococci. twenty-three lactobacillus spp. completely inhibited the growth of all mutans streptococci tested. species with maximum interference capacity against mutans streptococci included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. naturally occurring oral lactobacilli significantly inhibited the growth of both test strains of mutans streptococci and the subject's autologous mutans streptococci in vitro, and this effect was more pronounced in caries-free subjects.

TI  == a key role of dendritic cells in probiotic functionality.
AB  == background: disruption of the intestinal homeostasis and tolerance towards the resident microbiota is a major mechanism involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. while some bacteria are inducers of disease, others,  known as probiotics, are able to reduce inflammation. because dendritic cells (dcs) play a central role in regulating immune responses and in inducing tolerance, we investigated their role in the anti-inflammatory potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria. methodology/principal findings: selected lab strains, while efficiently taken up by dcs in vitro, induced a partial maturation of the cells. transfer of probiotic-treated dcs conferred protection against 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis. protection was associated with a reduction of inflammatory scores and colonic expression of pro-inflammatory genes, while a high local expression of the immunoregulatory enzyme indolamine 2, 3 dioxgenase (ido) was observed. the preventive effect of probiotic-pulsed dcs required not only myd88-, tlr2- and nod2-dependent signaling but also the induction of cd4+ cd25+ regulatory cells in an il-10-independent pathway. conclusions/significance: altogether, these results suggest that selected probiotics can stimulate dc regulatory functions by targeting specific pattern-recognition receptors and pathways. the results not only emphasize the role of dcs in probiotic immune interactions, but indicate a possible role in immune-intervention therapy for ibd.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum br11, a potential new probiotic, alleviates symptoms of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (dss) in rats.
AB  == current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are relatively ineffective. recently, probiotics have emerged as a potential treatment modality  for numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including ibd. few probiotics, however,  have undergone appropriate preclinical screening in vivo. the current study compared the effects of four candidate probiotics on development of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in rats. sprague dawley rats were gavaged 1  ml of the potential probiotic (1 x 10(10) cfu/ml), or vehicle, twice daily for 14 days. strains tested were lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), streptococcus thermophilus th-4 (th-4), bifidobacterium lactis bb12 (bb12) and lactobacillus fermentum br11 (br11). colitis was induced from day 7 to 14 via administration of 2% dss in drinking water. disease activity index (dai) was monitored daily until  rats were killed at day 14. dai decreased in dss+bb12 and dss+br11 compared to dss+vehicle. colon length increased in dss+br11 (10%) and dss+lgg (10%) compared  to dss+vehicle. dss+bb12 and dss+br11 prevented the distal colon crypt hyperplasia evident in dss+vehicle, dss+lgg and dss+th-4. br11 was most effective at reducing colitic symptoms. bb12 had minimal effects, whilst th-4 did not prevent dss-colitis and lgg actually exacerbated some indicators of colitis. further studies into the potential benefits of l. fermentum br11 are indicated.

TI  == in vitro studies of the digestion of caprine whey proteins by human gastric and duodenal juice and the effects on selected microorganisms.
AB  == the in vitro digestion of caprine whey proteins was investigated by a two-step degradation assay, using human gastric juice (hgj) at ph 2.5 and human duodenal juice (hdj) at ph 7.5. different protein and peptide profiles were observed after the first (hgj) and second (hdj) enzymatic degradation. the minor whey proteins serum albumin, lactoferrin and ig were rapidly degraded by hgj, while alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) were more resistant and survived both 30 and 45 min of the enzymatic treatment. further digestion with hdj still showed intact beta-lg, and the main part of alpha-la also remained unchanged. the protein degradation by hgj and hdj was also compared with treatment by commercial enzymes, by using pepsin at ph 2.5, and a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin at ph 7.5. the two methods resulted in different caprine protein and peptide profiles. the digests after treatment with hgj and hdj were screened for antibacterial effects on some selected microorganisms, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and streptococcus mutans. active growing cells of e. coli were inhibited by the digestion products from caprine whey obtained after treatment with hgj and hdj. cells of b. cereus were inhibited only by whey proteins obtained after reaction with hgj, while the products after further degradation with hdj demonstrated no significant effect. screenings performed on cells of lb. rhamnosus gg and s. mutans all showed no signs of inhibition.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == inability of probiotic bacterial strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 to induce human platelet aggregation in vitro.
AB  == platelet aggregation contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, and aggregation of platelets induced by lactobacilli is thought to be an important contributory factor in the development and progression of lactobacillus endocarditis. the main purpose of this study was to examine the effect of immunity-enhancing probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 on the activation and aggregation of human blood platelets. whole blood samples from healthy individuals were incubated in vitro with hn001 or hn019 and subsequently labeled with platelet-specific monoclonal antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-cd41a (expressed on normal platelets), and phycoerythrin-streptavidin-conjugated anti-cd62p (expressed on activated platelets) before analysis by flow cytometry. platelet-rich plasma was  used to assist the gating of the platelet cluster. adp and epinephrine were used  as the physiological platelet activation agonists. platelet aggregation-inducing  strain streptococcus sanguis 133-79 was used as a positive control strain. the mean fluorescence intensity of phycoerythrin and the percentage of platelets expressing the cd62p marker were used to assess the degree of platelet activation. the percentage of cd62p-positive platelets and the light scatter profiles of the agonist-activated platelets were used to identify the occurrence  and degree of platelet aggregation. hn001 and hn019 had no effect on spontaneous  platelet activation and aggregation; they also failed to exacerbate the platelet  aggregation activity induced by adp and epinephrine. therefore, these test probiotic strains hn001 and hn019 are less likely to participate in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis or other thrombotic disorders with regard  to platelet aggregation factors.

AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of specific lactic acid bacteria on the intestinal permeability to macromolecules and the inflammatory condition.
AB  == non-live probiotic bacteria and their fermentation products can be used in milk-based formula intended for healthy infants. the effects of a milk formula fermented with bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus and heated/dehydrated to inactivate the micro-organisms have been reported over the last few years to decrease the intestinal permeability to macromolecules in experimental animals in vivo and more recently to down-regulate inflammatory condition in vitro. feeding guinea-pigs with such dehydrated fermented milk reinforced the intestinal barrier resistance to food proteins (hrp, beta-lactoglobulin). in addition, the products secreted by bacteria were capable  of inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced tnf-alpha secretion by human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. the active secretion products were resistant  to digestive enzymes and their anti-inflammatory properties were preserved after  transepithelial transport across the filter-grown intestinal epithelial cell line, especially in inflammatory conditions. the binding of lps to monocytes as well as nfkappab nuclear translocation leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription were inhibited by bacteria-culture supernatants. conclusion: b. breve and s. thermophilus used as non-live micro-organisms in fermented infant formula seem to induce a reduction in macromolecular absorption and release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect, which persists after intestinal transport. thus, specific lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites seem to affect positively the intestinal function.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

AB  == neonatal group b streptococcal (gbs) infections are one of the important health problems because of their high mortality and morbidity rates in certain countries. there are some preventive approaches, including perinatal antibiotic therapy against these infections. recently, vaccination with conjugated gbs polysaccharides has also been practised. in this study, the in vitro inhibitory effects of 51 lactobacilli (of them 50 were purified from vaginal swabs, 1 from a commercial vaginal tablet) on five gbs (4 clinical isolates and 1 standard strain) were investigated by sandwich plate technique and deferred antagonism well technique. ten clinical isolates (20%) and the drug-purified lactobacilli expressed pronounced inhibitory effects on growth of gbs. all of the inhibitory isolates and 10 randomly selected non-inhibitory isolates were identified by api  50chl kit (biomeriex, france). seven (70%) of the inhibitory clinical isolates were lactobacillus rhamnosus. the inhibitory isolates had higher acid production  than the non-inhibitory ones (p < 0.05), and ph-adjustment destroyed their inhibitory effects entirely. if these results could be applied in vivo, it could  be postulated that administration of certain lactobacilli as probiotics via an appropriate regimen may be a safe, physiological and cheaper alternative for prevention of neonatal gbs infections.

TI  == biofilm growth of lactobacillus species is promoted by actinomyces species and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to integrate within a biofilm is pivotal to their survival. a dependence on the amount of biofilm growth by noncoaggregating lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus plantarum on coculture with actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus mutans and veillonella parvula was investigated using an artificial-mouth culture system. biofilm formation by the lactobacilli in mono-culture was poor. in coculture with actinomyces species the amount of l. rhamnosus increased 7-20 times and l. plantarum 4-7 times compared to its mono-culture biofilm. s. mutans also promoted substantial biofilm growth of lactobacilli but v. parvula had no effect. we conclude that these actinomyces species promoted growth of key lactobacillus species in a biofilm, as did s. mutans to a smaller extent, and that the ability  of individual bacteria to form mono-culture biofilms is not necessarily an indicator of their survival and pathogenic potential in a complex multispecies biofilm community.

AB  == this study investigated the efficiency of a chlorhexidine varnish and an antibiotic paste in suppressing the cultivable microflora of deep dentine cavities in a stepwise excavation procedure. subsequent to enamel preparation and removal of the central biomass, infected dentine was sampled from the cavity floor. ten cavities each were either covered with the 1% chlorhexidine- and 1% thymol-containing varnish cervitec (ce), the demeclocycline hydrocortisone-containing ointment ledermix (le) or received no treatment as control (co). a compomer composite was used as intermediate restorative. cavities were reassessed after 6 weeks and again dentine samples were microbiologically investigated for total viable counts, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. after 6 weeks a significant reduction of the total viable counts was observed in the le group (p = 0.011) compared to the control, whereas no differences were found in the ce group (p > 0.05). mutans streptococci were rarely recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks. compared to the co group counts of lactobacilli were significantly reduced in the ce and le groups (p < 0.05). lactobacillus species were frequently recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks of observation. lactobacillus rhamnosus was the predominant species in all samples investigated.  application of ce or le resulted in reduced counts of lactobacilli after a period of 6 weeks. although none of the materials completely eliminated the viable microorganisms, the use of le was more effective than ce in reducing the total anaerobic microorganisms associated with carious dentine.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  == molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. samples were cultured on blood agar and rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% co(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. dna was also extracted directly from the samples and 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr with universal primers. pcr products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. only three taxa, streptococcus mutans, rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed propionibacterium sp., were found in  all five samples. the predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel propionibacterium sp. (18%), olsenella profusa (14%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). the predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were streptococcus mutans (16%), lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). there was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (p < 0.05, wilcoxon matched pairs, signed  ranks test). in conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous  novel taxa are present.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus rhamnosus differentially induce maturation and production of th1-type cytokines and chemokines in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are the most efficient antigen-presenting cells and thus, have a major role in regulating host immune responses. in the present study, we have analyzed the ability of gram-positive, pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes and nonpathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus to induce the maturation of human monocyte-derived dcs. stimulation of dcs with s. pyogenes resulted in strong expression of dc costimulatory molecules cd80, cd83, and cd86 accompanied with a  t helper cell type 1 (th1) cytokine and chemokine response. s. pyogenes also induced interleukin (il)-2 and il-12 production at mrna and protein levels. in addition, il-23 and il-27 subunits p40, p19, p28, and ebi3 were induced at mrna level. in contrast, l. rhamnosus-stimulated dcs showed only moderate expression of costimulatory molecules and produced low levels of cytokines and chemokines. furthermore, no production of il-2 or il-12 family cytokines was detected. bacteria-induced dc maturation and especially cytokine and chemokine production were reduced when bacteria were heat-inactivated. our results show that human monocyte-derived dcs respond differently to different gram-positive bacteria. although pathogenic s. pyogenes induced a strong th1-type response, stimulation with nonpathogenic l. rhamnosus resulted in development of semi-mature dcs characterized by moderate expression of costimulatory molecules and low cytokine  production.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == lactobacilli and streptococci induce inflammatory chemokine production in human macrophages that stimulates th1 cell chemotaxis.
AB  == macrophages have a central role in innate-immune responses to bacteria. in the present work, we show that infection of human macrophages with gram-positive pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes or nonpathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg enhances mrna expression of inflammatory chemokine ligands ccl2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), ccl3/macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha (mip-1alpha), ccl5/regulated on activation, normal t expressed and secreted, ccl7/mcp-3, ccl19/mip-3beta, and ccl20/mip-3alpha and cxc chemokine ligands cxcl8/interleukin (il)-8, cxcl9/monokine induced by interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), and cxcl10/ifn-inducible protein 10. bacteria-induced ccl2, ccl7, cxcl9, and cxcl10 mrna expression was partially dependent on ongoing protein synthesis. the  expression of these chemokines and of ccl19 was dependent on bacteria-induced ifn-alpha/beta production. ccl19 and ccl20 mrna expression was up-regulated by il-1beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and in addition, ifn-alpha together with tnf-alpha further enhanced ccl19 gene expression. synergy between ifn-alpha and tnf-alpha was also seen for cxcl9 and cxcl10 mrna expression. bacteria-stimulated macrophage supernatants induced the migration of t helper cell type 1 (th1) cells, suggesting that in human macrophages, these bacteria can stimulate efficient inflammatory chemokine gene expression including those that recruit th1 cells to the site of inflammation. furthermore, l. rhamnosus-induced  th1 chemokine production could in part explain the proposed antiallergenic properties of this bacterium.

TI  == consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of priming  glycosyltransferase genes of the exopolysaccharide locus in strains of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == a primer design strategy named codehop (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (gt) gene in strains of the lactobacillus casei group. each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate  core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming gt gene products from exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing bacteria. the hybrid primers were used to detect the priming gt gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. casei, lactobacillus zeae, and streptococcus thermophilus. the priming gt gene was detected in the genome of both non-eps-producing (eps(-)) and eps-producing (eps(+)) strains of l. rhamnosus. the sequences of the cloned pcr products were similar to those of the priming gt  gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive eps(+) bacteria. specific primers designed from the l. rhamnosus rw-9595m gt gene were used to sequence the end of  the priming gt gene in selected eps(+) strains of l. rhamnosus. phylogenetic analysis revealed that lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which gt genes have been characterized to date. moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of l. rhamnosus  with respect to the terminal region of the priming gt gene. thus, the pcr approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with codehop is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == short-term consumption of probiotic-containing cheese and its effect on dental caries risk factors.
AB  == cheese is known to contain compounds that reduce the risk of dental caries. the long-term consumption of milk containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, atcc 53103 (lgg), has been shown to reduce caries risk in children. the aim of the present study was to examine whether short-term consumption of cheese containing lgg and  lactobacillus rhamnosus lc 705 would diminish caries-associated salivary microbial counts in young adults. altogether, 74 18-35 year-old subjects completed this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled study. during the 3 week intervention, the subjects ate 5 x 15 g cheese per day. oral examinations were made before and after the study. stimulated salivary secretion rates, buffer capacity and counts of salivary streptococcus mutans, yeast and lactobacilli were evaluated before and after the intervention and after a 3 week post-treatment period. the results showed no statistically significant difference between the groups in streptococcus mutans counts after the intervention, but during the post-treatment period there was a significantly greater reduction in these counts in the intervention group compared to the control group (p=0.05). however, streptococcus mutans counts decreased in 20% (p=0.01) and yeast counts in 27% (p=0.005) of all the subjects, regardless of the intervention group. results from logistic regression showed a trend indicating that probiotic intervention might reduce the risk of the highest level of streptococcus mutans (or=0.37, 95% ci 0.08-1.75, p=0.21) and salivary yeasts (or=0.40, 0.09-1.71, p=0.22).

TI  == stability and activity of specific antibodies against streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus in bovine milk fermented with lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg or treated at ultra-high temperature.
AB  == passive local immunization against dental caries is a promising approach to its prevention, as clinical evidence of active oral or nasal immunization is still limited and controversial. by means of systemic immunization of pregnant cows with a multivalent vaccine, high titres of igg antibodies against human cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, were produced in bovine colostrum. the purified immune product (ip) of this preparation has a number of anticariogenic properties, such as inhibition of streptococcal adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and inhibition of glucosyltransferase enzymes. this study investigated whether ip antibodies remained active and functional when added to ultra-high temperature (uht)-treated milk or to lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg)-fermented milk stored for an extended time. lgg was chosen because of its widely known health benefits in humans and animals. a commercial uht toddler's milk was supplemented with ip and stored for  2 months at 5, 21 and 30 degrees c. the antistreptococcal titres in uht milk did  not decline at any temperature during storage, and uht-ip inhibited the adherence of s. mutans for up to 2 months. this was not the case with uht toddler's milk without igg antibodies. milk was fermented with live lgg cells in the presence or absence of 5% ip. the antistreptococcal titres declined to about 30% of the original titres after storage. fresh milk alone slightly enhanced streptococcal adhesion but fresh milk with ip inhibited the adherence of s. mutans by over 50%. lgg-positive fermented milk without antibodies also inhibited (p < 0.05) the adhesion by about 40%. in both lgg-fermented and uht immune milk, the activity of antibodies against cariogenic streptococci was maintained during the expected shelf-life of these products. from the anticariogenic point of view it may be beneficial to add bovine-specific antibodies against mutans streptococci to probiotic lgg-containing milk products.

AB  == the behaviour of streptococcus thermophilus in combination with lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental cheddar cheese is reported. in a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38  degrees c cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. at a 41 degrees c cook temperature, the str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of  cheese ripening. adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential  to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between  the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. some possible consequences for cheese quality of using str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture causido(r) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. design: an 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. subjects: seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<bmi<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into  five groups. intervention: four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus (stla). group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (py). group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus (stlr). group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of enterococcus faecium and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus (causido(r) culture), gaio(r) (g). the dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. the fifth group was given two placebo pills (pp) daily. results: when comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the g-group on low density lipoproteins (ldl)-cholesterol (p=0.29). after adjustment for small changes in body weight, ldl-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; p<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; p<0.05) after 8 weeks in the g-group. this was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (p<0.05). after 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the stla and g-group compared to stlr. no other differences were found. conclusion: the causido(r) culture reduced ldl-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. the effect on ldl-cholesterol confirms previous studies. an immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain  the effect on fibrinogen in the g-group. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

TI  == lactobacilli and streptococci activate nf-kappa b and stat signaling pathways in  human macrophages.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria induce the production of several cytokines in human leukocytes. the molecular mechanisms involved in gram-positive bacteria-induced cytokine production have been poorly characterized. in this work we demonstrate that both nonpathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci) induce nf-kappa b and stat dna-binding activity in human primary macrophages as analyzed by emsa. nf-kappa b activation was rapid and was not inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting  that these bacteria could directly activate nf-kappa b. stat1, stat3, and ifn regulatory factor-1 dna binding was induced by both bacteria with delayed kinetics compared with nf-kappa b. in addition, streptococci induced the formation of ifn-alpha-specific transcription factor complex and ifn-stimulated gene factor-3 (isgf3). stat1 and stat3 activation and isgf3 complex formation were inhibited by cycloheximide or by neutralization with ifn-alpha/beta-specific abs. streptococci were more potent than lactobacilli in inducing stat1, isgf3, and ifn regulatory factor-1 dna binding. accordingly, only streptococci induced ifn-alpha production. the activation of the ifn-alpha signaling pathway by streptococci could play a role in the pathogenesis of these bacteria. these results indicate that extracellular gram-positive bacteria activate transcription factors involved in cytokine signaling by two mechanisms: directly, leading to nf-kappa b activation, and indirectly via cytokines, leading to stat activation.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == development of multi-species consortia biofilms of oral bacteria as an enamel and root caries model system.
AB  == the aim was to establish defined-species consortium plaque biofilms to investigate enamel and root caries in an artificial mouth. strains of the putative enamel and root caries pathogens, streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus, were screened in batch culture for potential cariogenic properties: a low terminal ph, ability to aggregate, and catabolic diversity. the strains selected were grown as monoculture biofilms and as consortium plaque biofilms in a multiplaque artificial mouth. the biofilms were supplied with a constant flow of a simulated  oral fluid and were given periodic sucrose (and in some instances glucose) to simulate meals. all the bacteria except l. rhamnosus formed large, monospecies biofilms with resting ph in the range 5.3-5.8. the consortia biofilms were larger and had a resting ph of 4.9-5.3. the consortia biofilms supplied with 8-hourly carbohydrate comprised mainly 'mutans' streptococci (58, sd 5.5%) and l. rhamnosus (42, sd 5.7%). a. naeslundii characteristically was absent or present in a low percentage (up to 4% colony-forming units). all biofilms demineralized polished bovine enamel and dentine blocks, as assessed by microradiography and enamel-surface microhardness measurement. the consortia also demineralized intact enamel and tooth roots; they were more cariogenic to enamel than any of the monoculture biofilms, as measured by enamel-surface softening, but variation in lesion depth was proportional to biofilm wet weight irrespective of acidogen composition (r = 0.93, p < 0.05). enamel lesions had a well-mineralized intact surface and a zone of subsurface demineralization, typical of early natural lesions. dentine and root lesions showed extensive demineralization but lacked a  pronounced surface mineralized zone. substitution of glucose for sucrose had no effect on the cariogenicity of the consortium to bovine enamel or human roots and had no major effect on the plaque composition. continuously supplied fluoride (19 parts/10(6)) resulted in a substantially reduced enamel surface softening and subsurface demineralization of intact roots. it was concluded that consortia biofilms of selected caries pathogens generate realistic caries lesions in all tooth hard tissues under controlled growth conditions in the artificial mouth. this in vitro caries experimental model may prove useful for the study of interrelations between the plaque biofilm, tooth tissues and the oral environment, and for the development of procedures to modify the course of caries development.

AB  == unheated and heat-treated homogenates were separately prepared from candidate probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. we compared the phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells in the presence of homogenates and in the presence of a control containing no homogenate by assessing thymidine incorporation in cell cultures. all homogenates suppressed proliferation, whether the enzymatic activity was inactivated or not inactivated by heating. when the proliferation assays were repeated with cytoplasmic and cell wall extracts derived from the homogenate of l. rhamnosus gg, the cytoplasmic extract but not the cell wall extract was suppressive. these findings indicate that candidate probiotic bacteria possess a heat-stable antiproliferative component(s). these bacteria may be used to generate microbiologically nonviable yet immunologically  active probiotic food products that are easier to store and have a longer shelf life.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  == most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon tn916 mutagenesis of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis). a 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dlta and dltb of lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (formerly called lactobacillus casei). a 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous dna in a fosmid library of s. gordonii dl1. this dna encoded d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. the cloned streptococcal dlta was disrupted by inserting an ermam cassette, and then it was  linearized and transformed into s. gordonii dl1 for allelic replacement. erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dlta exhibited a loss of d-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (lta) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. this phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kda surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (c. j. whittaker, d. l. clemans, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). the mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric  coaggregations. the mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. the natural dna transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. southern analysis of chromosomal dnas from  various streptococcal species with the dlta probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. thus, it is hypothesized that d-alanyl lta may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kda adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.

TI  == regulated expression of the streptococcus mutans dlt genes correlates with intracellular polysaccharide accumulation.
AB  == intracellular polysaccharides (ips) are glycogen-like storage polymers which contribute significantly to streptococcus mutans-induced cariogenesis. we previously identified and cloned a locus from the s. mutans chromosome which is required for the accumulation of ips. sequencing of this locus revealed at least  four contiguous open reading frames, all of which are preceded by a common promoter region and are transcribed in the same direction. analysis of the amino  acid sequence deduced from the first of these open reading frames (orf1) revealed domains which are highly conserved among d-alanine-activating enzymes (dlta) in lactobacillus rhamnosus (formerly lactobacillus casei) and bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequences derived from orf2, -3, and -4 also exhibit extensive similarity to dltb, -c, and -d, respectively, in these microorganisms. however, southern hybridization experiments indicate that this operon maps to a locus on the s. mutans chromosome which is separate from the glgp, glga, and glgd genes, whose products are known mediators of bacterial ips accumulation. we therefore assigned a new dlt designation to the locus which we had formerly called glg. we  maintain that the dlt genes are involved in s. mutans ips accumulation, however,  since they complement a mutation in trans which otherwise renders s. mutans ips deficient. in this study, we found that expression of the s. mutans dlt genes is  growth phase dependent and is modulated by carbohydrates internalized via the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). we demonstrated that the s.  mutans dlt genes are expressed constitutively when non-pts sugars are provided as the sole source of carbohydrate. consistent with a role for the pts in dlt expression is a similar constitutive expression of the dlt genes in an s. mutans  pts mutant grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented with glucose. in summary, these findings support a novel role for the dlt gene products in s. mutans ips accumulation and suggest that dlt expression in this oral pathogen is  subject to complex mechanisms of control imposed by growth phase, dietary carbohydrate, and other factors present in the plaque environment.

TI  == analysis of ph-driven disruption of oral microbial communities in vitro.
AB  == previously, a mixed culture chemostat system was used to demonstrate that the ph  generated from carbohydrate metabolism, rather than carbohydrate availability per se, was responsible for the shifts observed in the oral microflora which are associated with high carbohydrate diets and the development of dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine more accurately the microbially generated ph at which such shifts occurred. nine oral bacteria were grown in three independent chemostats, and pulsed with glucose on 10 consecutive days. in one chemostat, ph  control was discontinued for 6 h, and the ph fall was restricted to a minimum value of ph 5.5; the ph fall was arrested in the other two chemostats at either ph 5. 0, or at ph 4.5. when the ph was allowed to fall, the numbers and proportions of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus rhamnosus increased; this increase was directly related to the magnitude of the ph fall. veillonella dispar was the most numerous organism following all glucose pulsing regimes, especially  at low ph. the increase in proportions of acidogenic bacteria was accompanied by  a fall in the proportions of acid-sensitive species (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis). the counts of these species were relatively stable between ph 5.5 and 4.5, but were markedly reduced when the ph fell below ph 4.5; neisseria subflava could not persist in the culture at ph 4.5 or below. the data suggest that the disruption of communities associated with glucose metabolism and low ph can be explained in  terms of a two-stage process. a fall in ph to a value between ph 5.5 and 4.5 may  allow the enrichment of potentially cariogenic species, whilst permitting species associated with health to remain relatively unaffected. a further reduction in ph (<ph 4.5) may not only enhance the competitiveness of odontopathogens, but inhibit the growth and metabolism of non-caries-associated species. the results also indicate that species other that mutans streptococci or lactobacilli are competitive at ph values low enough to demineralise enamel, and thus suggest that a broader range of micro-organisms may be associated with caries initiation.

TI  == preliminary characterization of microflora of comte cheese.
AB  == the evolution of the microflora of three comte cheeses made in duplicate with raw milk from three different sources was followed during ripening. the same starter  was used with each type of milk. the comparison of the cheeses did not reveal any significant difference in the development of the microflora. starter lactic acid  bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus), which are added at the beginning of manufacture, decreased quickly in the first stages of ripening supporting the hypothesis of cell autolysis. other microorganisms, i.e.  homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli (lact. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, lact. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. fermentum), pediococci, enterococci and propionibacteria grew in cheese from small numbers in fresh curd. the characterization of strep. thermophilus by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that wild strains were also able to grow in the curd. the  values for the genome size of 11 strep. thermophilus strains determined in this investigation were in the range of 1.8-2.3 mbp. the potential role of starter and raw milk microflora in cheese flavour development was considered.

TI  == inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

AB  == statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, staphylococcus carnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, l. rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and en. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in salmonella typhimurium ta100 and ta97. the mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees c for 15 min were ineffective. in vitro, en. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and  cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and  heat-inactivated bacteria.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.
AB  == we compared different lactic acid bacteria for their effect on the immune response to rotavirus in children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. after initial oral rehydration, 49 children aged 6 to 35 months with rotavirus gastroenteritis randomly received either lactobacillus casei subsp. casei strain  gg (lgg), l. casei subsp. rhamnosus (lactophilus), or a combination of streptococcus thermophilus and l. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus (yalacta) twice daily for 5 days. serum antibodies to rotavirus, total number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (isc), and specific antibody-secreting cells (sasc) to rotavirus were measured at the acute stage and at convalescence. the mean (sd) duration of diarrhea was 1.8 (0.8) days in children who received lgg, 2.8 (1.2) days in those receiving lactophilus, and 2.6 (1.4) days in those receiving yalacta (f = 3.3, p = 0.04). the isc response was comparable in the three study groups, but the rotavirus-specific immune responses were different. lgg therapy was associated with an enhancement of iga sasc to rotavirus and serum iga antibody level at convalescent stage. we conclude that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, particularly lgg, promote serum and intestinal immune responses to rotavirus, and thus may be important in establishing immunity against rotavirus reinfections.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == effect of antioxidative lactic acid bacteria on rats fed a diet deficient in vitamin e.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, including bifidobacterium, with antioxidative activity were selected by in vitro screening. the effect of the antioxidative activity was investigated by in vivo experiments using rats that were deficient in vitamin e.  in the first stage of screening, 570 strains were examined; intracellular cell-free extracts of 19 strains (16 lactobacilli, 2 streptococci, and 1 lactococci) had antioxidative activity as determined by an assay using rat liver  microsomes and thiobarbituric acid. in the second stage of screening, 7 strains of lactobacilli showed over 70% inhibition of oxidation activity. the highest activity was obtained by heterofermentative lactobacillus sp. sbt 2028. the effect of two strains, lactobacillus sp. sbt 2028 and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus sbt 2257, was evaluated for improvement of the condition of rats fed a  diet deficient in vitamin e. intracellular cell-free extracts of those two strains were also used for in vivo experiments. hemolysis of red blood cells was  inhibited in rats that were administered the extract of lactobacillus sp. sbt 2028, which proved that the extract improved the vitamin e deficiency status. antioxidative activity of an extract from l. casei ssp. rhamnosus sbt 2257 determined by hemolysis was relatively weak compared with the activity of lactobacillus sp. sbt 2028 extract.

TI  == antibodies in normal and diseased pulps reactive with microorganisms isolated from deep caries.
AB  == immunoglobulin molecules in the supernatant fluids (sf) from pulpal explant cultures have been observed to react with microorganisms implicated in infections of root canals. in this study, the reactivity of immunoglobulin molecules in the  sf from normal and irreversible pulpitis pulps to six strains of predominant microorganisms isolated from the immediate layer of carious lesions above the pulps used for explant cultures was investigated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. two atcc strains of eubacterium were also included in this assay. specific antibodies to lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus (i), (ii), streptococcus mutans, bacteroides intermedius, eubacterium brachy, and eubacterium alactolyticum in the sf from the normal and irreversible pulpitis tissues were observed with a large variation of antibody levels in both groups. immunodiffusion assays of the sf revealed that igg was the major class of immunoglobulin in the normal as well as the irreversible groups. the presence of  natural antibodies in the normal pulps suggested a possible protective role of antibodies during the invasive process of caries.

TI  == antimicrobial action of new, proprietary lining cements.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of innovative, commercial lining cements was investigated. a liner which contains calcium hydroxide and is polymerized by visible light (prisma vlc dycal) and a glass-ionomer lining cement (gc lining cement) were compared with two more established lining cements (advanced formula  ii dycal and life). antibacterial activity and hemolysis-like agar change at 24,  48, and 72 hours were measured on blood agar plates inoculated with streptococcus mutans kpsk 2 (serotype c), lactobacillus casei ssp rhamnosus atcc 11981, and chewing-stimulated saliva. prisma vlc dycal did not affect bacteria or agar. the  glass-ionomer lining cement, with an acidic ph at setting, had the most pronounced effect on all test organisms and on the agar. even after 48 hours' setting, it inhibited growth of s. mutans. the control lining cement (afii dycal) showed antibacterial activity toward both specific micro-organisms as well as some activity against the salivary organisms. the material life showed only partial inhibition of microbial growth. for all lining cements, the hemolytic-like agar change correlated with antibacterial effects. the surface ph  of the freshly-set cements containing calcium hydroxide was alkaline. it would seem that a simple correlation between high surface ph and antibacterial activity among these cements does not exist. also, further biological characterization of  new lining cements is required to direct their appropriate clinical use.

TI  == lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  == the respiratory quinones of 73 strains of gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (mk-7) were the main quinone type found  in representatives of the genus bacillus and in sporolactobacillus inulinus. however, a strain of b. thuringiensis produced mk-8 in addition to mk-7, and strains of b. lentus and b. pantothenticus appeared to produce mk-9 and mk-8, respectively, with no mk-7. in the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in pediococcus cerevisiae nctc 8066 and lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus atcc 7469, which contained menaquinones, and streptococcus faecalis nctc 775 and him 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes  (except actinomyces odontolyticus and bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in protaminobacter alboflavus atcc 8458, the so-called  actinobacillus actinoides atcc 15900 and noguchia granulosis nctc 10559.

TI  == [lactobacilli of freshwater fishes].
AB  == normal microflora in the intestinal tract of fishes inhabiting fresh-water reservoirs includes lactic bacteria. the number of the bacteria depends on the animal species, the composition of food, the age, and the season. the highest number of these microorganisms (hundreds of millions per gram of the intestinal content) is found in carps. enterococci are most often encountered in fishes inhabiting ponds: streptococcus faecalis andrewes a. horder, str. faecium orla-jensen, str. bovis orla-jensen. lactobacilli are more typical of fishes in water reserviors: lactobacillus plantarum (orla-jensen) bergey et al., l. casei (orla-jensen) hansen a. lessel, l. casei var. casei, l. casei var. rhamnosus, l.  casei var. alactosus, l. leichmannii (henneberg) bergey et al., l. acidophillus (moro) hansen a. mocquot, l. fermenti beijerinck, l. cellobiosus rogosa et al., l. buchneri (henneberg) bergey et al. the content of lactic bacteria varies in water reservoirs; their highest content is found in ooze (tens of thousands per gram).
