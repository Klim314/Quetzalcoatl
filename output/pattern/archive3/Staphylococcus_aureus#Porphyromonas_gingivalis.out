in vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three common pathogenic bacteria. background data: ultraviolet (uv) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. the bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (led) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. materials and methods: the bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength led irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli dh5alpha). average power output was 6 mw/cm(2) for 1 h. the bacteria were exposed to led irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 j/cm(2), respectively). led irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. control bacteria were incubated without led irradiation. bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (cfu) and at an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. results: the bactericidal effect of led phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. the bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. especially, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and s. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. however, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for p. gingivalis, e. coli dh5alpha, or s. aureus. conclusions: irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to s. aureus, e. coli, and p. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. s. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.
the papain inhibitor (spi) of streptomyces mobaraensis inhibits bacterial cysteine proteases and is an antagonist of bacterial growth.
a novel papain inhibitory protein (spi) from streptomyces mobaraensis was studied to measure its inhibitory effect on bacterial cysteine protease activity (staphylococcus aureus sspb) and culture supernatants (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacillus anthracis). further, growth of bacillus anthracis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae was completely inhibited by 10 mum spi. at this concentration of spi, no cytotoxicity was observed. we conclude that spi inhibits bacterial virulence factors and has the potential to become a novel therapeutic treatment against a range of unrelated pathogenic bacteria.
dna/protamine complex paste for an injectable dental material.
a dna/protamine complex powder was prepared by reaction between dna and protamine sulfate solution with stirring in order to develop a new injectable biomaterials for dental therapy. the powder of dna/protamine complex became paste by kneading the complex powder and distilled water. complex formation was confirmed by ft-ir measurement. the complex paste had a porous structure and its viscosity was approximately 280.1 pas. the paste could easily pass through a needle of 0.25 mm internal diameter. it seemed that dna/protamine complex paste has suitable viscosity for clinical use as an injectable biomaterial. although, the complex paste delayed the growth speed of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia for limited periods, it cannot kill and inhibit growing bacteria. the complex paste disk showed a mild tissue response and gradually degraded after the implantation into the soft tissue of rats. these results suggested that this dna/protamine complex paste could be a useful material for a biodegradable biomaterial. in particular, this paste will be applicable as an injectable biomaterial using syringe for the repair of defects of living tissue, gbr treatment and/or gtr treatment in dentistry.
interactions between various microbes and ginseng botanicals.
three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria, and eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as intrasporangium sp. gs603, microbacterium sp. gs514, caulobacter leidyia, bifidobacterium sp. int57, bifidobacterium sp. sj32, fusobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., aspergillus niger, fusarium sacchari, paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, rhizopus stolonifer, myrothecium verrucaria and acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.
[characterization and antibacterial effect of ag-nha-ntio2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
objective: undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (ag-nha-ntio2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (pa66) by co-polymerization method. the purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. methods: the morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (aas), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (edx). staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. results: xrd results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (ha). a homogeneous distribution of the ca, p, ti and ag element in the membrane was confirmed by edx. both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by sem and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. the bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of s. aureus and 56.31% of e. coli were killed. however, 91.84% of p. gingivalis, 90.64% of f. nucleatum and 90.49% of s. mutans were killed and pictures of sem showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. conclusion: the nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
[the antimicrobial effects of chitosans on oral pathogenic microbes in vitro].
purpose: to study the antimicrobial activities of chitosans of different molecular weights and concentrations on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5 in vitro. methods: the inhibition effects of chitosans of different molecular weights and different concentrations (2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%) on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis in culture were investigated, and the differences of their antimicrobial activities under high temperature and after filtering were compared. one way analysis of variance, randomized block design analysis of variance and t test were used for statistical analysis. results: chitosans of different molecular weights all showed bacteriostatic effects on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. low molecular weight chitosans showed the strongest effects, but the high molecular weight ones had strong effects on streptococcus mutans (p<0.05,0.01). the bacteriostatic effects of chitosans were not affected by high temperatures (p>0.05). conclusion: chitosans have inhibitory effects on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5.
effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis is present.
antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola. when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.
