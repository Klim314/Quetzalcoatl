TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae filamentous phage ngophi6 is capable of infecting a variety of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we constructed a phagemid consisting of the whole genome of the neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteriophage ngophi6 cloned into a pbluescript plasmid derivative lacking the f1 origin of replication (named pbs::phi6). escherichia coli cells harboring pbs::phi6 were able to produce a biologically active phagemid, ngophi6fm, capable of infecting, integrating its dna into the chromosome of, and  producing progeny phagemids in, a variety of taxonomically distant gram-negative  bacteria, including e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens. a derivative of pbs::phi6 lacking the phage orf7 gene, a positional homolog of filamentous phage proteins that mediate the interaction between the phage and the bacterial pilus, was capable of producing phagemid particles that were able to infect e. coli, haemophilus influenzae, n. sicca, pseudomonas sp., and paracoccus methylutens, indicating that ngophi6 infects cells of these species using a mechanism that does not involve the orf7 gene product and that ngophi6 initiates infection through a novel process in these species. we further demonstrate that the establishment of the lysogenic state does not require an active phage integrase. since phagemid particles were capable of infecting diverse hosts, this indicates that ngophi6 is the first broad-host-range filamentous bacteriophage described.

TI  == diagnostic implications of 16s ribosomal assay for gonorrhoea.
AB  == objectives: in the absence of a single nucleic acid amplification test (naat) that is both highly specific and sensitive for gonorrhoea, many have put forward  the 16s-based assay as a confirmatory test for neisseria gonorrhoeae. this study  was undertaken to evaluate the performance of pcr based on 16s ribosomal gene in  comparison with a pora pseudogene-based assay. methods: the specificity of both the pora pseudogene-based pcr and 16s ribosomal gene pcr was checked against a panel of strains comprising of non n gonorrhoeae neisseria sp (ngns) and other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the sensitivity studies were performed  using different dilutions of n gonorrhoeae dna. pcrs were also done on endocervical and urethral swab samples collected from a total of 100 female and 50 male patients presenting to sexually transmitted disease clinics, dermatology  opd of aiims and safdarjang hospital, new delhi, india, recruited as per inclusion criteria. results: pcr assay based on 16s ribosomal gene showed cross-reactivity with three of six strains of n sicca. the pora pseudogene-based  pcr was highly specific. analytical sensitivity of 16s-based ribosomal assay was  more than that of pora pseudogene-based assay. in clinical samples, for female patients, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 16s ribosomal assay was 100% (95% ci 51.7% to 100%), 91.5% (95% ci 83.4% to 96%), 42.9% (95% ci 18.8% to 70.4%) and 100% (95% ci 94.7% to 100%), respectively, while for the male patients it was 100% (95% ci 85% to 100%), 95.5% (95% ci 75.1% to 99.8%), 96.6% (95% ci 80.4% to 99.8%) and 100% (95% ci 80.8% to 100%), respectively. conclusions: the data presented in this report supports use of 16s ribosomal assay as a screening assay only. the pora pseudogene target is highly specific for n gonorrhoeae and may be used as a supplemental assay.

TI  == isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in dammam  in eastern saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: this study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of dammam, in the eastern region of saudi arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. materials and methods: the analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. results: there were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria sicca, micrococcus luteus, proteus mirabilis, bacillus subtilis, and enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. there were fungal isolates as follows: alternaria alternata, aspergillus niger, cladosporium sp., penicillium spp., aspergillus flavus, aspergillus fumigatus, rhizopus stolonifer, aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. conclusions: the study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to  the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. this means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia from pulmonary abscess in a male alcohol abuser.
AB  == a case of gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia is reported. this bacteremia occurred  in a male alcohol abuser who developed definite signs of pulmonary abscess and empyema. streptococcus milleri grew from another blood culture, but gardnerella vaginalis was also isolated from a bronchoscopic aspirate and pleural drainage sample as part of mixed flora containing anaerobes, streptococcus species, neisseria sicca, and a haemophilus sp. we discuss the possible pathogenic character of g. vaginalis outside the genital tract from a review of the literature.

TI  == a multi-resistance plasmid isolated from commensal neisseria species is closely related to the enterobacterial plasmid rsf1010.
AB  == pfm739, an r plasmid from neisseria sicca that encodes penicillin, streptomycin and sulphonamide resistance, and the enterobacterial incq(p-4) plasmid rsf1010, which encodes streptomycin and sulphonamide resistance, were incompatible, and were mobilized by the same conjugative plasmids. restriction mapping confirmed a  high degree of similarity between both r plasmids; pfm739 carried dna fragments corresponding to the known replication and resistance regions of rsf1010. pfm739  also carried an extra segment with the same restriction map as that described for the beta-lactamase-coding region of transposon tn3. it is suggested that the r plasmids isolated from commensal neisseria sp. could have resulted from transposition of a tn3-like genetic element to an rsf1010-like plasmid, and that  they contain deletion derivatives of transposon tn3.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus neisseria.
AB  == eleven aerobic species of neisseria, a mima sp., and a herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) homology in direct hybridization experiments. dna labeled with either (14)c or (32)p was prepared from five species of neisseria. unlabeled dna from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled dna (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 c. the measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous dna. all serological types of n. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of n. meningitidis with one possible exception, type z. the genus neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae; second, n. perflava, n. subflava, n. sicca, n. flavescens, and n. flava; third, n. catarrhalis and n. caviae. mima and herellea species show no significant homology with the neisseria.
