in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s. salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
antibiofilm activity of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide.
cell-free extracts isolated from colony biofilms of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 were found to inhibit biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, but not by a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 itself, in a 96-well microtiter plate assay. physical and chemical analyses indicated that the antibiofilm activity in the extract was due to high-molecular-weight polysaccharide. extracts isolated from a mutant strain deficient in the production of serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide did not exhibit antibiofilm activity. a plasmid harboring the serotype 5 capsule genes restored the antibiofilm activity in the mutant extract. purified serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide also exhibited antibiofilm activity against s. aureus. a. pleuropneumoniae wild-type extracts did not inhibit s. aureus growth, but did inhibit s. aureus intercellular adhesion and binding of s. aureus cells to stainless steel surfaces. furthermore, polystyrene surfaces coated with a. pleuropneumoniae wild-type extracts, but not with capsule-mutant extracts, resisted s. aureus biofilm formation. our findings suggest that the a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsule inhibits cell-to-cell and cell-to-surface interactions of other bacteria. a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 capsular polysaccharide is one of a growing number of bacterial polysaccharides that exhibit broad-spectrum, nonbiocidal antibiofilm activity. future studies on these antibiofilm polysaccharides may uncover novel functions for bacterial polysaccharides in nature, and may lead to the development of new classes of antibiofilm agents for industrial and clinical applications.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of brazilian medicinal plant extracts against pathogenic microorganisms of interest to dentistry.
this study evaluated the susceptibility of oral pathogenic microorganisms candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to brazilian medicinal plant extracts of schinus terebinthifolius (aroeira), croton campestris (velame), lafoensia pacari (pacari), centaurium erythraea (centaurea), stryphnodendron adstringens (barbatimao), and anacardium humile (cajuzinho-docerrado), as compared to standardized antimicrobial agents (nystatin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline hydrochloride). ethanol, hexane and butane fractions from stem barks, rinds, leaves, and/or roots were extracted and tested. antimicrobial diffusion agar test and mic were performed according to clsi. after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the diameter of inhibition zones and spectrophotometer readings were measured and compared. the results were reported as means +/- standard deviation (m +/- sd). with the exception of five extracts that showed no antimicrobial activity, all the extracts tested showed antimicrobial activity, in different levels. this study suggests that extracts from the plants tested could be an alternative therapeutic option for infectious conditions of the oral cavity, such as denture stomatitis, dental caries, and periodontitis.
