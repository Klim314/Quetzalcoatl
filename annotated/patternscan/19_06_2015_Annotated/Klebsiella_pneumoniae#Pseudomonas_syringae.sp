TI  == genetic and functional diversity among the antagonistic potential fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from tea rhizosphere.
AB  == twenty-five fluorescent pseudomonads from rhizospheric soil of six tea gardens in four district of upper assam, india were isolated and screened for antagonistic activity against fungal pathogens such as fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani (for), fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri (foc), fusarium semitectum (fs), and rhizoctonia solani (rs); and bacterial pathogens-staphylococcus aureus (sa), escherichia coli (ec), and klebsiella pneumoniae (kp). most of the isolates exhibited strong antagonistic activity against the fungal pathogens and gram-positive bacterium i.e. staphylococcus aureus. productions of siderophore, salicylic acid (sa), hydrogen cyanide (hcn), and cell wall-degrading enzyme (chitinase) were studied to observe the possible mechanisms of antagonistic activity of the isolates. correlation between the antagonistic potentiality of some isolates and their levels of production of siderophore, salicylic acid, and  hydrogen cyanide was observed. out of the 25 isolates, antibiotic-coding genes, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (dapg) and pyoluteorin (plt) were detected in the isolates, pf12 and pf373, respectively. genetic diversity of these fluorescent pseudomonads were analyzed with reference to four strains of pseudomonas fluorescens nicm 2099(t), p. aeruginosa mtcc 2582(t), p. aureofaciens nicm 2026(t), and p. syringae mtcc 673(t). 16s rdna-rflp analysis of these isolates using three tetra cutter restriction enzymes (haeiii, alui and mspi) revealed two distinct clusters. cluster a comprised only two isolates pf141 and 24-pfm3, and cluster b comprised 23 isolates along with four reference strains.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and the mic values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, candida albicans, candida glabrata, alternaria alternata, ascochyta rabiei, aspergillus niger, fusarium culmorum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium oxysporum, fusarium solani, and penicillium notatum. there  was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, salmonella typhimurium, alternaria citri, alternaria tenuissima, and gaeumannomyces graminis. chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.

TI  == regulation of enteric endophytic bacterial colonization by plant defenses.
AB  == bacterial endophytes reside within the interior of plants without causing disease or forming symbiotic structures. some endophytes, such as klebsiella pneumoniae 342 (kp342), enhance plant growth and nutrition. others, such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), are human pathogens that contaminate raw produce. several lines of evidence are presented here to support  the hypothesis that plant defense response pathways regulate colonization by endophytic bacteria. an ethylene-insensitive mutant of medicago truncatula is hypercolonized by kp342 compared to the parent genotype. addition of ethylene, a  signal molecule for induced systemic resistance in plants, decreased endophytic colonization in medicago spp. this ethylene-mediated inhibition of endophytic colonization was reversed by addition of the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene. colonization of medicago spp. by s. typhimurium also was affected by exogenous ethylene. mutants lacking flagella or a component of the type iii secretion system of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (ttss-spi1) colonize the interior of medicago spp. in higher numbers than the wild type. arabidopsis defense response-related genotypes indicated that only salicylic acid (sa)-independent defense responses contribute to restricting colonization by kp342. in contrast, colonization by s. typhimurium is affected by both sa-dependent and -independent responses. s. typhimurium mutants further delineated these responses, suggesting that both flagella and ttss-spi1 effectors can be recognized. flagella act primarily through sa-independent responses (compromising sa accumulation still affected colonization in the absence of flagella). removal of a ttss-spi1 effector resulted in hypercolonization regardless of whether the genotype was affected in either sa-dependent or sa-independent responses. consistent with these results, s. typhimurium activates the promoter of pr1, a sa-dependent pathogenesis-related gene, while s. typhimurium mutants lacking the ttss-spi1 failed to activate this promoter. these observations suggest approaches to reduce contamination of raw produce by human enteric pathogens and to increase the number of growth-promoting bacteria in plants.

TI  == the predicted protein product of a pathogenicity locus from pseudomonas syringae  pv. phaseolicola is homologous to a highly conserved domain of several procaryotic regulatory proteins.
AB  == a ca. 20-kilobase (kb) region (hrp) that controls the interaction of pseudomonas  syringae pv. phaseolicola with its host (pathogenicity) and nonhost plants (hypersensitive reaction) was previously cloned and partially characterized. in this study we defined the limits and determined the nucleotide sequence of a hrp  locus (hrps), located near the right end of the hrp cluster. the largest open reading frame (orf302) in hrps has a coding capacity for a 302-amino-acid polypeptide. the predicted amino acid sequence of the translation product of orf302 (hrps) shows significant similarity to several procaryotic regulatory proteins, including the ntrc, nifa, and dctd proteins of rhizobium spp., the ntrc and nifa proteins of klebsiella pneumoniae, and the tyrr protein of escherichia coli. these proteins regulate diverse operons involved in nitrogen fixation, transport and metabolism of amino acids, and transport of c-4 dicarboxylic acids. the hrps protein appears to be the shortest naturally occurring member of this family of proteins, corresponding for the most part to the highly conserved central domain of these proteins, which contains a putative atp-binding site. a c-terminal segment analogous to the less-well-conserved domain, involved in dna binding of ntrc and nifa, is also present in hrps. these similarities suggest that hrps is a regulatory protein. in line with this prediction is the finding that a functional hrps gene is necessary for the activation of another hrp locus  during the plant-bacterium interaction.
