TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of lactobacillus spp. against brachyspira hyodysenteriae and brachyspira pilosicoli.
AB  == the sensitivity of brachyspira hyodysenteriae and brachyspira pilosicoli, respectively the causative agents of swine dysentery and porcine intestinal spirochaetosis to two probiotic lactobacillus strains, l. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and l. farciminis cncm-i-3699 was studied through viability, motility and coaggregation assays. the cell-free supernatant of these lactobacilli contains lactic acid, that is stressful for brachyspira (leading to the formation of spherical bodies), and lethal. it was demonstrated for the first time the in vitro coaggregation properties of two probiotic lactobacillus strains (active or  heat-treated) with two pathogenic strains of brachyspira, leading to (1) trapping of spirochaetal cells in a physical network as demonstrated by sem; (2) inhibition of the motility of brachyspira. such in vitro studies should encourage in vivo studies in animal model to evaluate the potential of the use of probiotic lactobacilli through a feeding strategy for the prevention of b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli.
