TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == stent hypersensitivity and infection in sinus cavities.
AB  == persistent mucosal inflammation, granulation tissue formation, hypersensitivity,  and multifactorial infection are newly described complications of retained drug-eluting stents from endoscopic sinus surgery for refractory rhinosinusitis.  in an important report published in allergy and rhinology, a 45-year-old male patient suffering from recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery and was found, for the first time, to have steroid-eluting catheters that were inadvertently left in the ethmoid and frontal sinuses. the retained catheters had caused persistent mucosal inflammation and formation of granulation tissue denoting hypersensitivity reaction. these consequences had induced perpetuation of symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. meticulous removal of the retained stents with the nitinol wings from inflamed tissues of the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoethmoidal recesses in which they were completely imbedded was successfully performed without polypoid regrowth. cultures of specimens taken from both left and right stents showed heavy growth of stenotrophomonas maltophilia and moderate growth of klebsiella oxytoca, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus anginosus. fungal infection was not detected. the current knowledge and experience regarding stent hypersensitivity and infection in relation with the use of stents in sinus  cavities is reviewed.

TI  == duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. this disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of cd. the aim  of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of cd patients and control children. duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, wilkins-chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, casitone, and fatty acid agar. the isolates were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active cd patients, followed by  nonactive cd patients and control individuals. members of the phylum proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active cd than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum firmicutes were less abundant. members of the families enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae, particularly the species klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. in contrast, members of the family streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active cd than in controls. furthermore, isolates of the streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both cd patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. the findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.
