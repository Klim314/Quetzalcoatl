TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == assessment of interleukin-6 receptor inhibition therapy on periodontal condition  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: overproduction of interleukin (il)-6 may play a pathologic role in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and chronic periodontitis (cp). the present study assesses il-6 receptor (il-6r) inhibition therapy on the periodontal condition of patients with ra and cp. methods: the study participants were 28 patients with ra and cp during treatment with il-6r inhibitor, and 27 patients with ra and cp during treatment without il-6r inhibitor. periodontal and rheumatologic parameters and serum levels of cytokine and inflammatory markers and immunoglobulin g against periodontopathic bacteria were examined after medication with il-6r inhibitor for 20.3 months on average (t1) and again 8 weeks later (t2). results: no differences were observed between the groups in any parameter values at t1, except for serum il-6 levels. the anti-il-6r group showed a significantly greater decrease in gingival index, bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and serum levels of il-6 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-3 from t1 to t2 than the control group (p <0.05).  a significant correlation was found between changes in serum anticyclic citrullinated peptide levels and those in pd and cal in the anti-il-6r group (p <0.05), whereas both groups exhibited a significant association between changes in serum mmp-3 levels and those in bop (p <0.05). conclusion: changes in periodontal and serum parameter values were different between the patients with ra and cp during treatment with and without il-6r inhibitor.

TI  == eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas asaccharolytica pleural empyema in a diabetic patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome on noninvasive ventilation.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. pleuropulmonary infections by this microorganism are uncommon. pulmonary aspiration is a chief predisposing condition. although the outcome is usually favorable, its distinctive antibiotic  sensitivity pattern makes bacterial identification an important feature in dealing with this infection. the authors report a case of pleural empyema caused  by co-infection with eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas asaccharolytica, in an immunocompetent diabetic patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, followed  by a discussion on the role of noninvasive ventilation in the development of this infection.

TI  == assessment of the plasma/serum igg test to screen for periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a silent infectious disease prevalent worldwide and affects lifestyle-related diseases. therefore, efficient screening of patients is essential for general health. this study was performed to evaluate prospectively  the diagnostic utility of a blood igg antibody titer test against periodontal pathogens. oral examination was performed, and igg titers against periodontal pathogens were measured by elisa in 1,387 individuals. the cut-off value of the igg titer was determined in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and changes in periodontal clinical parameters and igg titers by periodontal treatment were evaluated. the relationships between igg titers and severity of periodontitis were analyzed. the best cut-off value of igg titer against porphyromonas gingivalis for screening periodontitis was 1.682. both clinical parameters and igg titers decreased significantly under periodontal treatment. igg titers of periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls, especially in those with sites of probing pocket depth over 4 mm. multiplied cut-off values were useful to select patients with severe periodontitis. a blood igg antibody titer test for porphyromonas gingivalis is useful to screen hitherto chronic periodontitis patients.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  == aim: to investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga sputigena. methodology: forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna-dna hybridization (micro-ident plus; hain lifescience, germany). results: extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for p. micra, f. nucleatum and c. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus c. rectus. significant association was recorded between f. nucleatum-endo and p. micra-endo  (p = 0.03, fisher's exact test). there was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) c. sputigena-endo and c. sputigena-perio (p = 0.06, fisher's exact test); (ii) p. micra-endo and p. micra-perio (p = 0.05, fisher's exact test). sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with p. micra-endo (p = 0.03, pearson chi-square test). conclusion: the findings suggest that f. nucleatum, p. micra and c. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == antibody responses to periodontopathic bacteria in relation to rheumatoid arthritis in japanese adults.
AB  == background: periodontopathic bacteria have been implicated as contributory to the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). anticyclic citrullinated peptide (ccp) antibodies and rheumatoid factor (rf) were shown to be associated with ra. this study examines whether serum levels of antibodies to periodontopathic bacteria may affect clinical and laboratory profiles of ra. methods: the study participants consisted of 80 patients with ra, and 38 age-, sex-, smoking status-, and periodontal condition-balanced healthy controls. after periodontal and rheumatologic examination, serum levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies  to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and eikenella corrodens (ec) and those of anti-ccp antibodies and rf were determined  by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: patients with ra showed significantly higher levels of anti-pg and anti-ccp antibodies than controls (p = 0.04 and p <0.0001). in contrast, igg responses to aa and ec in patients with ra  were significantly lower than those in controls (p <0.0001 and p = 0.0001). multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association of anti-pg and anti-aa igg responses with ra, after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02). anti-pg titer displayed a significant correlation with rf levels, probing depth, and clinical attachment level (p = 0.03, p = 0.03, and p = 0.02). conclusion: these results suggest that serum levels of anti-pg igg antibodies were associated with ra, and might affect serum  levels of rf and periodontal condition in patients with ra.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard dna hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  == samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. the most prevalent taxa were olsenella uli (74%), eikenella corrodens (63%), porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and bacteroidetes oral clone x083 (51%). when prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), bacteroidetes clone x083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by parvimonas micra (28%), e. corrodens (23%), and tannerella forsythia (19%). the number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the  first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. in addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with  this disease.

TI  == [microbiological and biochemical characteristics of inflammatory tissues in the periodontium].
AB  == objective: to investigate bacterial populations in subgingival and supragingival  plaque samples of patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases and activities  of the lysosomal enzymes--lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase--in peripheral venous blood, in gingival crevicular fluid, and mixed nonstimulated saliva. methods and materials: the study included 60 patients with inflammatory periodontal diseases without any internal pathology and 24 periodontally healthy subjects. molecular genetic assay (micro-ident plus, germany) for complex identification of additional six periodontopathic bacteria was applied. the activity of lysozyme was determined turbidimetrically, the activity of alkaline phosphatase--spectrophotometrically with a "monarch" biochemical analyzer, the activity beta-glucuronidase--according to the method described by mead et al. and modified by strachunskii. results: a statistically significant association between clinical and bacteriological data was found in the following cases: gingival bleeding in the presence of eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga spp. (p<0.01); pathological periodontal pockets in the presence of peptostreptococcus micros (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), fusobacterium nucleatum (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), campylobacter rectus (alpha< or =0.05 and beta< or =0.2), and capnocytophaga spp. (p<0.05); and satisfactory oral hygiene in the presence of all microorganisms investigated (p<0.05). the activity of lysozyme in gingival crevicular fluid and  mixed nonstimulated saliva indicates the severity of periodontal inflammation. based on clinical data, in assessing the amount of lysozyme in mixed nonstimulated saliva, sensitivity and specificity of 100% was found. increased activities of lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase were found in peripheral venous blood of patients with inflammatory periodontal disease as compared to control group. conclusions: the main principles of the treatment of periodontal inflammatory diseases should be based on microorganism elimination, creation of individual treatment means affecting microflora in the mouth and immune system of macroorganisms.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == a new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aims: various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently  identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization method. methods: fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least  one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). one diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic  probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. results: twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than  healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). a significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, and eikenella corrodens). of the species in the new panel only prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis, and porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. conclusion: it was concluded that p. tannerae, f. alocis, and p. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == caspase activation is involved in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis, a common infectious disease, is initiated by various gram-negative bacteria and characterized by the destruction of the periodontal tissue. here, we investigated the role of caspases, intracellular proteases that are the key mediators of apoptosis. we show that activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 is considerably enhanced in gingival tissue from patients with periodontitis. we also demonstrate in in vitro experiments that various periodontopathic bacteria exert a direct growth-suppressing effect and, moreover, can trigger a host-mediated cytotoxic activity involving the cd95 death receptor. our data suggest that caspase activation is a prominent feature in periodontitis-associated tissue injury.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == adjunctive antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis: long-term effects on disease progression and oral colonization.
AB  == background: this study assessed the long-term effects of adjunctive antimicrobial therapy on periodontal disease progression and oral colonization. methods: patients with previously untreated chronic periodontitis and subgingival actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis were randomly assigned to subgingival scaling without (control group) or with systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole and chx irrigation (test group). relative attachment levels were determined and subgingival and mucosal plaque samples were taken at baseline, at 10 days (plaque only) and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months following initial therapy. during maintenance therapy, patients received supragingival debridement only. results: after 24 months, the 18 test group patients showed at sites with initial probing depths (pd) > or =7 mm a significantly (p <0.05) higher frequency of 2 mm or more attachment gain (37.3% +/- 4.6%) and lower frequency of attachment loss (7.2% +/- 3.1%) compared to the  17 controls (8.2% +/- 3.9% and 19.1% +/- 13.1%, respectively). compared to controls, the intraoral prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (up to 18 months)  and p. gingivalis (up to 3 months) decreased and that of eikenella corrodens (at  10 days) increased in test patients (p <0.05). in both treatment groups, the detection frequency of tannerella forsythensis decreased transiently, while an overall increase was recorded for treponema ssp. conclusions: over the 24-month period, a single course of the administered adjunctive antimicrobial therapy led  to a relative risk reduction of 62% for attachment loss at deep sites. however, with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans, it failed to induce long-term changes in the prevalence profiles of oral colonization.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == serum phenytoin concentration and igg antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == determination of eight selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque of maxillary first molars in japanese school children aged 8-11 years.
AB  == to prevent the onset or progression of periodontitis, we must understand when periodontal pathogens are first harbored and how they develop the biofilm that causes periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between clinical status and selected periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque in school children. this study was conducted with 95 school children, 8-11 years old. the presence and distribution of eight selected periodontal pathogens sampled from the maxillary right first molar were determined by an indirect immunofluorescent technique and compared with clinical  parameters. of the 95 sites sampled, only one site had all eight pathogens and five sites did not have any of the eight pathogens. the mean number of positive pathogens per site was 3.5 +/- 1.8 and mean percentage of positive pathogens was  3.82 +/- 4.22%. the number and total percentage of positive pathogens were strongly correlated with the plaque index (pi). in addition, the number of positive pathogens was correlated to the presence of subgingival calculus. the most frequently found pathogens were campylobacter rectus (84.2%) and eikenella corrodens (83.2%), and the least, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype c (7.4%). of the eight pathogens, the frequency and distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly correlated with pi and the presence of calculus. in addition, seven sites with both p. gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus showed a  correlation with gingival inflammation. in conclusion, the presence of p. gingivalis or p. gingivalis and b. forsythus may be a risk marker to be sought in screening for the onset of periodontal disease.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens.
AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on the periodontal disease pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by ph and nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the  3 bacteria. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.

AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == longitudinal study of dental implants in a periodontally compromised population.
AB  == background: the purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine the clinical  status and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of dental implants and natural teeth in patients with a history of periodontitis. methods: twenty-five partially edentulous patients treated for moderate to advanced adult periodontitis and having a total of 42 implants participated in this 3-year study. the assessment of clinical status was done 1, 2, and 3 years after prosthetic loading (t1, t2, and t3, respectively). clinical parameters evaluated  included probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi). the subgingival microbiota at peri-implant and periodontal sites were analyzed at t1 and t2. results: no significant difference  in clinical parameters between implants and teeth and within the 2 groups between different time points was observed through the study. pd and cal measurements of  sampled periodontal and peri-implant sites did not show any statistically significant difference through the study and between the 2 groups. pi of sampled  periodontal sites showed a statistically significant improvement during the study. from the morphological observation of the subgingival microbiota, a significant difference in the composition of motile rods between implants and teeth was found at t1. there were no differences detected in the subgingival microbiota, culturally identified at peri-implant and periodontal sites for the duration of the study. conclusions: in conclusion, implants were colonized by the indigenous periodontal microbiota and were well maintained in patients with a history of periodontitis. no significant association between progressing or non-progressing periodontal or peri-implant sampled sites in terms of loss of attachment and infection with at least one of the searched periodontal pathogens  was found, suggesting that the presence of putative periodontopathogens at peri-implant and periodontal sites may not be associated with future attachment loss or implant failure.

TI  == invasion of human coronary artery cells by periodontal pathogens.
AB  == there is an emerging paradigm shift from coronary heart disease having a purely hereditary and nutritional causation to possibly having an infectious etiology. recent epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease. however, to date, there is minimal information as to the possible disease mechanisms of this association. it is our  hypothesis that invasion of the coronary artery cells by oral bacteria may start  and/or exacerbate the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis. since a few periodontal pathogens have been reported to invade oral epithelial tissues, we tested the ability of three putative periodontal pathogens-eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia-to invade human coronary artery endothelial cells and coronary artery smooth muscle cells. in this study we demonstrate by an antibiotic protection assay and electron microscopy that specific species and strains invade coronary artery cells at a significant level. actin polymerization and eukaryotic protein synthesis in metabolically active cells were required since the corresponding inhibitors nearly abrogated invasion. many intracellular p. gingivalis organisms were seen to be present in multimembranous vacuoles resembling autophagosomes by morphological analysis. this is the first report of oral microorganisms invading human primary cell cultures of the vasculature.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

TI  == neutrophil response and microbiological findings around teeth and dental implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. the 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and  3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. all sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. the samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. the elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding  implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. the antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. no correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. this study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger  neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.

AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == dental plaque flora of the dog with reference to fastidious and anaerobic bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == animal bite wounds are amongst the most common types of traumatic injuries in humans. the organisms isolated from these wounds generally reflect the oral flora of the biting animal, and may be fastidious in nature and difficult to identify.  this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas and prevotella spp. in supragingival dental plaque collected from the right maxillary canine and carnassial teeth and the right mandibular canine tooth of dogs. in part one of the study, 30 dogs were used. e. corrodens was found in 62% of these dogs and 44% of individual plaque samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the dogs sampled. in part two, 34 dogs were used to determine the prevalence of the black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (porphyromonas and prevotella spp.). porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68% of these dogs and 47% of individual plaque samples. prevotella intermedia was present in 44% of the dogs and 23% of individual plaque samples. the recently described porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas salivosa, porphyromonas cangingivalis, porphyromonas cansulci, porphyromonas crevioricanis and prevotella denticola species were isolated from only 9%, 6%, 3%, 3%, 3% and 3% of dogs respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. in conclusion, black-pigmented  anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 91% of the animals sampled and therefore constitute a significant risk with respect to bite wound infections. it is also suggested that the prevalence of e. corrodens in wound infections has been underestimated in previous reports because of use of inappropriate techniques for detecting this organism.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the presence of disease-associated bacteria in health-associated plaque correlated with susceptibility to periodontitis over time. sites of periodontal health were identified in 65 adults. six months later (recall 1), plaque was collected from sites that remained in periodontal health, and specific bacteria were detected using monoclonal antibodies in a microscopic assay. the spirochete morphogroup was identified by phase contrast microscopy. the relationship between detection at recall 1 and development of periodontitis over two successive 6-month intervals (recalls 2 and 3) was evaluated by means of logistic regression using generalized estimating equations (gee), from which odds ratios (or) were estimated and tested for significance. significant relationships were defined as  those having ors with p < 0.05. ninety-three of 1,032 sites developed signs of early periodontitis over the 12-month interval between recall 1 and recall 3. the spirochete morphogroup (or = 3.13, p < 0.001) and pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros) (or = 3.68, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with healthy sites that developed periodontitis. the association of treponema socranskii was not significant (or = 3.62, p = 0.0918). odds ratios for campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and porphyromonas gingivalis were less than 2.0 and not significant. treponema denticola was not detected in health-associated plaque from stable health sites and was detected in only three  sites that progressed to periodontitis. these findings indicate that the presence of pros and some unidentified spirochetes in health-associated plaque is associated with increased susceptibility to periodontitis.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of minocycline-loaded microcapsules in adult periodontitis.
AB  == clinical and microbiological effects of subgingival delivery of 10% minocycline-loaded (mc), bioabsorbable microcapsules were examined in 15 adult periodontitis patients. patients received oral hygiene instruction 2 weeks prior  to the study. at baseline (day 0) all teeth received supragingival scaling (sc);  2 quadrants received no further treatment and 1 quadrant received subgingival scaling and root planning (srp). in the fourth quadrant, the tooth with the deepest probing sites (at least 1 site > or = 5 mm) was treated with minocycline  microcapsules. the sites were evaluated at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. clinical indices included bleeding on probing (bop), probing depths (pd), and attachment loss (al). microbiological evaluations included percent morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; cultivable anaerobic, aerobic, and black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb); and percent porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and actinomyces viscosus by indirect immunofluorescence. in  the sc + mc group, bop, pd, and al were significantly reduced from baseline for weeks 1 to 6. bop in the sc + mc group was significantly reduced compared to the  srp group from weeks 2 to 6. in the sc + mc group the percent of spirochetes and  motile rods decreased and the percent of cocci increased after 1 week. the increased cocci and decreased motile rods were statistically greater at weeks 4 and 6 in the sc + mc group compared to the srp group. this study demonstrates that local subgingival delivery of 10% minocycline-loaded microcapsules as an adjunct to scaling results in reduction in the percent sites bleeding on probing  greater than scaling and root planning alone and induces a microbial response more favorable for periodontal health than scaling and root planing.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == cross-infection from periodontitis sites to failing implant sites in the same mouth.
AB  == twenty-five tooth and implant sites in nine patients were investigated for the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms, using specific dna probes for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter recta. five of nine patients showed a likelihood of transmission from tooth to implant sites. these patients also showed a high number of putative periodontopathic organisms present in the tooth sites tested.  a significant risk was found of transmitting putative periodontopathic organisms  from periodontitis sites to implant sites in the same mouth. an appropriate clinical protocol needs to be developed to address this issue.

TI  == microbial ecology of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga spp. in adult periodontitis.
AB  == information on intraoral distribution of putative periodontal pathogens might be  essential for controlling different forms of periodontal disease. colonization may be either promoted or impeded by other bacteria competing in the subgingival  ecosystem. in recent investigations microbial associations between dental organisms have been determined in a multitude of subgingival plaque samples within multiple patients and described by odds ratios, in most circumstances without taking into account the correlated structure of the observations within a single individual. the present investigation had 3 major objectives: (i) to describe the intraoral distribution of some facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative rods, i.e. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens-like organisms and capnocytophaga spp., in a multitude of subgingival and extracrevicular samples of 10 adult subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis; (ii) to analyse possible inconsistencies of microbial associations between these periodontal organisms; and (iii) to determine factors increasing the likelihood of isolating these bacteria in a given subgingival site by employing generalized estimation equation (gee) methods. clinical examinations were carried out at 6 sites of every tooth present. in each subject, 13 extracrevicular (2 cheek mucosa, 3 tongue, 4 gingival, 2 tonsillar samples, 1 palatinal, 1 saliva sample) and between 22 and 44 subgingival samples from deepest sites of every tooth present (n = 296) were selectively cultivated for a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens and capnocytophaga spp. in extracrevicular material, a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and e. corrodens were isolated in 9, 10 and 6 patients, and from 65, 82 and 15% samples, respectively. the organisms were recovered from 51,  62 and 27% subgingival plaque samples, respectively. heterogeneity tests did not  reveal significant inconsistencies of microbial associations between bacteria in  subgingival plaque. mantel-haenszel's odds ratios ranged between 2.0 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. and 18.7 for capnocytophaga spp. and e. corrodens. an exchangeable working dependence structure was employed in the gee approach. the odds of isolating a. actinomycetemcomitans was increased by factor 3.7 in 4-6 mm deep pockets, and 9.5 in > or = 7 mm deep pockets. the odds  of presence of e. corrodens was increased by factor 10.8 in the case of presence  of capnocytophaga spp. and 2.1 in the case of presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. capnocytophaga spp. were associated with bleeding on probing and molar sites. presence of e. corrodens was associated with clinical attachment loss but not periodontal probing depth. results of the present study indicated an association of a. actinomycetemcomitans with periodontal pathology.  whereas this organism and capnocytophagae were widely distributed in extracrevicular ecosystems of the mouth, e. corrodens only occasionally appeared  in saliva or on mucous membranes of the oral cavity. in general, gee methods seem to allow to determine factors associated with the presence of periodontal organisms in a multivariate approach and considering the correlated structure of  the data.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens detected by dna probe method in hiv vs non-hiv periodontitis.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens associated with hiv and non-hiv related periodontal lesions. methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from both hiv-seropositive and hiv-seronegative patients affected with periodontal disease. dna probes were used to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus. results: a actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and b. forsythus (p < 0.05) were more prevalent in hiv-seronegative patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis. only c. rectus was slightly more prevalent in hiv-seropositive subjects with periodontal diseases, but this was not significant.

TI  == myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  == myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. there are three myeloperoxidase isoforms:  mpo i, mpo ii and mpo iii. we examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena and streptococcus sanguis. isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-a-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in mpo i and diminished in mpo iii. exceptionally, serum-opsonized a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests  based upon myeloperoxidase.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == the influence of periodontitis on the subgingival flora around implants in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == the hypothesis that teeth act as reservoirs of micro-organisms for the colonization of oral implants has recently been stated several times. the present study aimed at examining, in partially edentulous patients with severe periodontitis, whether pockets around teeth and implants harbored a comparable micro-flora. in 6 patients (3 with refractory periodontitis and 3 with advanced chronic adult periodontitis), plaque samples were taken from a deep and shallow pocket around both teeth and implants for differential phase contrast microscopy  and dna probe analysis. the results showed important differences in the sub-gingival flora between the 2 disease groups, as well as between deep and shallow pockets, around both implants and teeth. on the other hand, when pockets  around teeth and implants with equal depths were compared a striking similarity was observed in the microbial composition. these observations confirm the hypothesis that pockets around teeth act as a reservoir and highlight the importance of periodontal health when oral implants are planned.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == associations between porphyromonas gingivalis and oral treponemes in subgingival  plaque.
AB  == colonization and/or proliferation of treponema denticola may depend on the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis. the aims of this study were to confirm this synergistic relationship, to determine whether other oral bacteria were similarly associated with p. gingivalis and to relate coinfection to the periodontal status of plaque donors. subgingival plaque was collected from every tooth except third  molars in 106 subjects who were grouped by their worst periodontal condition. in  addition to p. gingivalis, monoclonal antibodies were used to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, t. denticola, treponema socranskii and pathogen-related oral spirochetes. associations of these bacteria with coinfection by p. gingivalis were assessed by estimated odds ratios. the results  indicate that coinfection with p. gingivalis is linked to all tested bacteria, but each pair was associated with distinct periodontal conditions. the distribution of coinfected sites suggests biased colonization of facial surfaces  over lingual surfaces.

TI  == comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (sam), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated  bone and on various mammalian cell populations. in this study, the relative ability of the sam from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha has been investigated. the bacteria investigated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the sam, or of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each sam. all sams demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - mono-mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. however, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each sam when compared on  a concentration basis (w/v). the most active sam was from a. actinomycetemcomitans with those from e. corrodens and p. gingivalis being slightly less active. the least active cytokine-stimulating sams were from c. rectus and pr. intermedia. one major difference between the sams and e. coli lps  was the inability of the former to stimulate hgfs to release il-1 beta or tnf alpha although they could stimulate pbmcs to release these cytokines. this may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == periodontal status and detection frequency of bacteria at sites of periodontal health and gingivitis.
AB  == it is generally recognized that bacteria in dental plaque at sites of periodontal diseases are not commonly found at sites of periodontal health. one hypothesis to explain the etiology of periodontitis is that pathogenic bacteria from diseased sites infect healthy sites. it has been suggested that gingival inflammation may  predispose sites to colonization by bacteria associated with periodontal diseases. the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether the  detection frequency of selected bacteria at sites of periodontal health or gingivitis differed between subjects who were in good periodontal health, subjects who had gingivitis, or subjects with periodontitis. the clinical status  of every tooth (except third molars) from 106 subjects was characterized by means of clinical attachment level, probing depth and by signs of inflammation. subgingival plaque was collected from mesio-facial and disto-lingual surfaces. specific monoclonal antibodies were used in an immunocytochemical assay to identify campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pathogen-related oral spirochetes (pros, using treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum monoclonal antibodies), t. denticola (serotypes a-d), t. socranskii subspecies buccale and t. socranskii subspecies socranskii. differences in detection of bacteria between groups of subjects were measured using odds ratios  (or). results of this study indicate that pros was the only identified bacterium  at sites of both health and gingivitis that demonstrated a significant positive relationship with the presence of periodontitis. these findings do not prove that bacteria spread from periodontitis sites, nor do they imply that disease necessarily results from infection. however, these data do suggest that some bacteria associated with periodontitis are more likely than others to tolerate conditions at healthy sites and that the presence of periodontitis increases risk of infection at healthy sites.

TI  == the subgingival microflora and gingival crevicular fluid cytokines in refractory  periodontitis.
AB  == refractory periodontitis manifests as a rapid, unrelenting, progressive loss of attachment despite the type and frequency of therapy. this study examined possible relationships between cytokine levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), occurrence of specific periodontopathic microflora, and disease activity in patients with refractory periodontitis. refractory periodontitis patients (7 male and 3 female) were selected on the basis of history and longitudinal clinical observations. in each patient, 2 teeth with pocket depths greater than 6 mm were selected and individual acrylic stents were fabricated with reference grooves for each site. the sites were examined at both baseline and 3 months later. the pattern and amount of alveolar bone resorption were assayed by quantitative digital subtraction radiography. pocket depth and attachment loss were measured with a florida probe. the gingival index was measured at 4 sites around each sample tooth. sites were divided into active sites (> or = 2.1 mm loss of attachment in 3 months) or inactive sites (< or = 2.0 mm loss of attachment in 3 months). the distribution and prevalence of the predominant microflora in active and inactive sites were compared using anaerobic culture and indirect immunofluorescence. interleukin-1 beta, 2, 4, 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) were quantified by elisa. prevotella intermedia and eikenella corrodens significantly  decreased in inactive sites but remained the same in active sites after 3 months. the active sites revealed significantly higher gcf levels of il-2 and il-6 than inactive sites at both baseline and at 3 months. il-1 beta was also significantly greater in active sites than in inactive sites at 3 months. alveolar bone loss in active sites correlated with increased gcf levels of il-1 beta and il-2. these results suggest that gcf levels of il-1 beta, il-2 and il-6 and p. intermedia and e. corrodens in subgingival plaque may serve as possible indicators of disease activity in refractory periodontitis.

AB  == in a 12-month multi-center study of 116 adult periodontitis subjects, six putative periodontal pathogens were monitored by dna probe methods in a subset of 31 subjects. monitored species included porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), eikenella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) with an  average detection limit of 1.8 x 10(4) bacterial colony forming units/sample. the microbiological response to four periodontal treatments was studied, one treatment in each quadrant; scaling and root planing (s), scaling and root planing with tetracycline (tc) fiber (sf), a single application of tc fiber (f) and two serial applications of tc fiber (ff). generally two sites were sampled in each quadrant, however, in some quadrants only one site was selected. these treatments were evaluated at baseline; immediately following therapy; and post-treatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. the study was conducted with a split-mouth design with no maintenance therapy over a 12-month period. at baseline, 70.8% of sites had detectable fn; 42.9% pg; 63.5% pi; 29.7% ec; 28.3% cr; and 5.5% aa. no significant differences were seen in baseline proportions of  these species between centers. numbers and proportions of detectable pathogens (with the exception of pg) exhibited a triphasic temporal response: a precipitous initial decrease immediately following therapy; a rise in proportions in the 1- to 3-month post-therapy period; and a spontaneous decline in the absence of therapy over the 3- to 12-month period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == comparison of the osteolytic activity of surface-associated proteins of bacteria  implicated in periodontal disease.
AB  == objectives: to compare the osteolytic activity of surface-associated material (sam) and lipid a-associated proteins (laps) from periodontopathogenic bacteria.  materials and methods: surface-associated material was extracted from the surface and laps from the cell walls of a range of periodontopathic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. these bacterial fractions were assayed to determine their composition and their capacity to induce bone resorption was determined by use of the neonatal murine calvarial bone resorption assay. results: the sams from e. corrodens and a. actinomycetemcomitans demonstrated bone-resorbing capacity at concentrations as low as 1 ng ml-1 which, given the molecular weights of the active components, is  in the picomolar range of activity. in contrast, the sams from the other three bacteria were significantly less potent and showed a lower efficacy. the laps all showed significant, and similar, capacities to induce bone breakdown. conclusions: this is the first demonstration that lap from periodontopathic bacteria can stimulate bone degradation. the laps from diverse bacteria all produced similar levels of bone-resorbing activity. in contrast, the sam showed significant differences in potency and in efficacy (maximal stimulation). this may mean that in vivo certain periodontopathic bacteria have significantly more bone-resorbing capacity than others and should be therapeutic targets.

TI  == serum antibody response to surface-associated material from periodontopathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == saline extracts of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens contain surface-associated components of these bacteria.  it has been shown that these extracts are potent stimulators of bone resorption in vitro. the possibility that the components of these surface-associated materials (sam) could contribute to the serum immune response in patients with juvenile or adult onset forms of rapidly progressive periodontitis were investigated by direct binding elisa. very high titres of serum igg antibodies to sam from a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). patients with adult onset rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) had significantly raised antibody levels to sam from p. gingivalis. both groups of patients had significantly raised levels of antibodies to sam from e. corrodens compared with control sera. thus, not only does solubilized sam have the capacity to induce bone resorption, but it also contributes to the antigenic load on the immune system in ljp and rpp.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == the oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora in young children: longitudinal changes from edentulous to dentate mouth.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. the bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). during the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. prevotella  melaninogenica, nonpigmented prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum group and capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. the occurrence of prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, campylobacter (wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. only the occurrence of bacteroides gracilis and veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as prevotella denticola, fusobacterium spp. other than the f. nucleatum group and selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. the stability of the  colonizing p. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == bactericidal activities of synthetic human leukocyte cathepsin g-derived antibiotic peptides and congeners against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga sputigena.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. are gram-negative bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease (particularly in individuals with neutrophil defects) and life-threatening systemic infections. they are resistant to many antibiotics of microbial origin but are sensitive to the nonoxidative microbicidal action of neutrophils. these organisms are susceptible to the microbicidal effect of cathepsin g but are killed by two distinct mechanisms. the purpose of this study was to assess their sensitivity to the antibiotic effects of iiggr and hpqynqr, antimicrobial peptides derived from  human neutrophil cathepsin g. the efficacies of the synthetic peptides iiggr and  hpqynqr were tested by single-dose screening, dose-response, and kinetic assays against three representative strains (each) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. and one strain of eikenella corrodens. strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans were sensitive to iiggr and hpqynqr at equal concentrations (wt/vol), whereas strains of capnocytophaga and e. corrodens were more sensitive  to iiggr than to hpqynqr. these differential antibiotic effects occurred over both time and dose ranges too narrow to be of therapeutic significance but are consistent with the premise that cathepsin g kills these oral bacteria by two distinct mechanisms. except for ivggr, congeners of iiggr, including aiggr, iaggr, iiagr, iigar, iigga, iqggr, ilggr, and i-norleucyl-ggr (inlggr), were microbicidal at 500 micrograms/ml. iiggr-amide exhibited no antibiotic activity.  the d-enantiomer of iiggr, didiggdr, was as potent as iiggr itself. apqynqr exhibited antibiotic activity but somewhat less than hpqynqr. we conclude that charge distribution, but not chirality or net charge, is an important determinant in the antibiotic efficacy of iiggr. moreover, peptide antibiotics derived from cathepsin g may have therapeutic value against periodontal gram-negative, facultative bacteria.

AB  == the purposes of this study were to determine if: 1) an association exists between cigarette smoking and signs of periodontal disease after controlling for the confounding variables of age, sex, plaque, and calculus; 2) the prevalence of 5 bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease differs between smokers and non-smokers; and 3) the presence of any of these bacteria or smoking are associated with a mean proximal posterior probing depth > or = 3.5 mm. plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and probing depth were measured at the proximal surfaces of all teeth in one randomly selected posterior dental sextant in 615 adults. subgingival plaque was sampled from the same sites and assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. a subsample of non-smokers (n = 126), who were similar to smokers (n = 63) with respect to age,  sex, plaque, and calculus, was randomly drawn from the original sample. these two groups were then compared on the basis of clinical and microbial parameters. the  results indicated that the odds of having a mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm were 5 times greater for smokers than the non-smoker subsample (odds ratio = 5.3; 95%  ci = 2.0 to 13.8). no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any of the bacteria was found between smokers and the non-smoker subsample. based on logistic regression analyses of each of the 5 bacteria and smoking, mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm was significantly associated with the presence of a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and smoking (p < 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == an in vivo study of the influence of the surface roughness of implants on the microbiology of supra- and subgingival plaque.
AB  == in nine patients with fixed prostheses supported by endosseous titanium implants, 2 titanium abutments (transmucosal part of the implant) were replaced by either an unused standard abutment or a roughened titanium abutment. after 3 months of habitual oral hygiene, plaque samples were taken for differential phase-contrast  microscopy, dna probe analysis, and culturing. supragingivally, rough abutments harbored significantly fewer coccoid micro-organisms (64 vs. 81%), which is indicative of a more mature plaque. subgingivally, the observations depended on the sampling procedure. for plaque collected with paper points, only minor qualitative and quantitative differences between both substrata could be registered. however, when the microbiota adhering to the abutment were considered, rough surfaces harbored 25 times more bacteria, with a slightly lower density of coccoid organisms. the presence and density of periodontal pathogens subgingivally were, however, more related to the patient's dental status than to  the surface characteristics of the abutments. these results justify the search for optimal surface smoothness for all intra-oral and intra-sulcular hard surfaces for reduction of bacterial colonization and of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == demonstration of the glycocalyces associated with three oral gram-negative bacterial species using a modern acrylic resin technique.
AB  == the complex highly hydrated chemical composition of the bacterial glycocalyx renders it difficult to preserve and visualize at the ultrastructural level. polyanionic stains such as ruthenium red help to maintain some structural integrity, and other more modern approaches include antibody stabilization, lectins, and the addition of lysine to the primary fixative. it has been suggested that the glycocalyx of certain disease-associated organisms may play a  role in the pathogenesis of some microbially based diseases such as periodontitis. new, more adequate, modern methodologies are therefore required for the further study of this structure. in the present study a cold dehydration  process in conjunction with lr white acrylic resin has been employed to study the glycocalyces of three oral gram-negative bacterial species reported to be periodontopathogens. when compared with organisms processed conventionally and with ruthenium red, the organisms processed by the cold dehydration and lr white  method demonstrated a fibrous matrix that was not seen in the other specimens. these results indicate that a combination of reduced dehydration temperature and  cold acrylic resin embedding provides the best methodology for the visualization  of the fine structure of the bacterial glycocalyx. this approach may be particularly useful in the study of organisms within specific disease-associated  environments such as the periodontal pocket.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp.

(28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. one microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and  two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic gram-negative organisms. fusobacterium spp., prevotella melaninogenica, and p. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. while rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were  a common feature of nonrecall patients. the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. the differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. the cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. samples from clefts were never wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less capnocytophaga and actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.

TI  == inhibition of bone dna and collagen production by surface-associated material from bacteria implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease.
AB  == gentle extraction of oral bacteria implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal  disease, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, or eikenella corrodens, with saline removes the extracellular components while leaving the bacteria intact. this readily-solubilized surface-associated material (sam) has been demonstrated to significantly inhibit dna and collagen synthesis by murine calvaria at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. dna and collagen synthesis in isolated calvarial osteoblasts were also inhibited by these sam preparations with similar dose responses. the inhibitory effect of these bacterial expolymers was blocked by 1 microm indomethacin. the potent inhibitory  actions on bone synthesis of the sam from these bacteria may contribute to the alveolar bone loss found in patients with periodontal disease.

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == anti-proliferative and cytotoxic activity of surface-associated material from periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the easily solubilized surface-associated material from three bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens, produced dose-dependent inhibition of thymidine incorporation by human fibroblasts, the human monocytic cell line u937 and guinea pig epidermal cells. in contrast, lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were either inactive or substantially less active over the dose range tested. one of the constituents of  surface-associated material from a 'non-leucotoxic' strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans was highly cytotoxic to human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells, with 50% killing from less than 1 ng/ml. a constituent of the surface-associated material from p. gingivalis was approximately one log order less active. the lipopolysaccharides from these bacteria were at least three log orders less active in neutrophil killing. these findings add weight to  the hypothesis that easily solubilized exopolymers from periodontopathogens play  a major part in the pathology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the microbiological efficacy of an adjunctive minocycline periodontal formulation delivered subgingivally. subjects  were systemically healthy but exhibited severe periodontitis; i.e., probing depths greater than 6 mm. the two study groups included individuals who received  minocycline or a placebo periodontal formulation after root planing. subgingival  plaque samples were obtained at baseline; prior to treatment; and at 1, 3, and 6  months. plaque was evaluated by darkfield microscopy and further analyzed for total dark-pigmented bacteroides species, p. intermedia, p. gingivalis and streptococcus, actinomyces, eikenella, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, and fusobacterium species using cultivable flora techniques. in addition, plaque was  evaluated for yeast on a selective agar medium. when compared to the placebo, the minocycline group had significantly lower proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months and lower proportions of motile rods at 3 months. furthermore, when compared to the placebo group, the minocycline patients had lower mean proportions of dark-pigmented bacteroides spp. and p. intermedia at 1 and 3 months as well as lower proportions of e. corrodens at 1 month. the minocycline group had significant decreases in proportions of spirochetes at 1 and 3 months,  motile rods at 1 and 3 months, and increases in cocci at 1, 3, and 6 months when  compared to baseline. in the placebo group, root planing was also effective at decreasing spirochetes at 1, 3, and 6 months, but with significant differences seen only at 3 and 6 months. however, the degree of reduction in spirochete proportions was greater in the minocycline group when compared with the placebo group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the occurrence of oral gram-negative anaerobes was examined in 30 edentulous infants (mean age 3 months, range 1-7 months). one pooled swab sample from mucosal surfaces (cheeks, palate, tongue) and one saliva sample was taken from each infant. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using non-selective and selective media. prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica was the most frequently isolated anaerobe, found in 70% of the infants. the other common anaerobes were fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella spp. and nonpigmented  prevotella (bacteroides) spp., found in 60%, 57% and 57% of the infants, respectively. of corroding bacilli, bacteroides gracilis was detected in 23% of the infants, wolinella spp. and microaerophilic eikenella corrodens in one infant (3% each). leptotrichia spp., microaerophilic capnocytophaga spp., prevotella (bacteroides) loescheii and prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia were found in 17%, 13%, 13% and 7% of the infants, respectively. in addition to these 30 infants, 21 edentulous infants were investigated for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans only. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the 51 edentulous infants. the number of different anaerobic bacterial species in the same mouth varied from 0 to 7. no anaerobic bacteria were detected in 3 of 30 children (10%). these data suggest that various anaerobic bacterial species readily colonize the edentulous mouth in infants.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == incidence of periodontitis recurrence in treated patients with and without cultivable actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis: a prospective study.
AB  == a total of 98 adults previously treated for moderate to advanced periodontitis and on a trimonthly recall schedule were screened for the presence of critical levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis. patients with at least 2  positive sites were placed in a positive group and patients without or with low levels of these bacteria in a negative group. during the 30-month study the incidence of disease recurrence was greater in the positive group, but did not reach statistical significance. positive patients with deeper pockets tended to be at greater risk of developing recurrent disease than those with shallower pockets. in the positive group only, both a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery and antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans strain nctc 9710 (serotype c) were inversely correlated with disease recurrence. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia above critical levels did not reliably predict future episodes of disease recurrence in this population. the sparse recovery of p. gingivalis did not permit us to assess its diagnostic value. with  the exception of p. gingivalis, for which insufficient data were available, the results indicate that the presence or absence of the above bacterial species cannot of itself serve as a reliable predictor of future episodes of recurrent disease in a population of treated patients on a regular trimonthly recall schedule.

TI  == defective neutrophil function in an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients. a case report.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) function in a poorly controlled adult insulin-dependent diabetic patient (iddm) with severe recurrent periodontitis, while describing the microbiological and clinical findings. chemotaxis, superoxide production, and phagocytosis and killing of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis by the iddm pmn were evaluated  1 week before treatment relative to a healthy, matched control. these analyses revealed a significant (p less than .05) depression in the number of iddm pmns migrating along an fmlp gradient (boyden chamber assay). in addition, a significant (p less than .05) enhancement of iddm pmn superoxide production in response to opsonized zymosan (cytochrome c reduction) was observed. phagocytosis and killing (fluorochrome phagocytosis assay) by iddm pmn of two p. gingivalis strains was also impaired significantly (p less than .05). the subgingival microflora contained significant levels of p. gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and peptostreptococcus micros. periodontal treatment consisted of extraction of hopeless teeth, scaling and root planing and 3 weeks of augmentin therapy. the antibiotic therapy resulted in unrecoverable numbers of the putative pathogens and a reduction in both gingival  inflammation and disease progression. the iddm healing response to previous surgical treatment and extractions was poor, presumably due to a marked thrombocytopenia (91 x 10(3) platelets/mm3).

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological characteristics of subjects with "refractory" periodontal disease.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between attachment loss and clinical, microbiological, and immunological parameters in a group of 21 human subjects exhibiting poor response to previous periodontal therapy. all had  been treated with periodontal surgery, tetracycline, and subsequent maintenance recalls to periodontists who, upon detection of disease progression, referred the subjects to our clinic. in our clinic, each subject received oral hygiene instruction and a thorough subgingival scaling and root planing utilizing as many appointments as necessary. clinical indices, including gingival index, bleeding on probing, suppuration, plaque index, pocket depth, and duplicate measurements of attachment level from an acrylic stent, were collected at monthly intervals. probing measurements were performed using the florida probe. when significant attachment loss (0.8-1.2 mm) was detected in at least 1 site, a bacterial sample  was taken from that site and from a comparably deep, but non-progressing, control site. microbial samples were enumerated by darkfield microscopy, on selective and non-selective media, and by predominant cultivable technique. blood samples were  also collected to determine antibody levels against potential pathogens. there was no difference in the amount of plaque present in sites gaining or losing attachment, but losing sites exhibited more bleeding and suppuration. 20 of the 21 subjects were tested; of these, 17 exhibited elevated serum antibody against one or more of the following microorganisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides, gingivalis, and eikenella corrodens. however, few, if any, of the "classical" pathogens were detected in the plaque samples obtained at the time progressive disease was diagnosed. the only exception was streptococcus intermedius, which occurred in slightly higher numbers in active sites.

TI  == dna probe detection of periodontal pathogens in hiv-associated periodontal lesions.
AB  == recent studies have shown that an atypical gingivitis and a rapidly progressive periodontal disease may be early-occurring opportunistic infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. this study examined the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens associated with these hiv-related periodontal lesions. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from both hiv-seronegative and hiv-seropositive homosexual men and from presumably uninfected heterosexual men. dna probes were used to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and wolinella recta in the plaque. the healthy sites in both the seronegative and seropositive homosexual groups showed a greater prevalence of all test bacteria, except for e. corrodens, than did the heterosexual group. hiv-associated periodontitis sites showed a microbial profile qualitatively similar to that of conventional periodontitis, except that b. gingivalis was more prevalent in conventional periodontitis. in contrast, hiv-associated gingivitis sites exhibited a greater prevalence of all bacteria tested than conventional gingivitis sites. in fact, hiv gingivitis generally showed a bacterial profile similar to that of the hiv periodontitis lesions, except that w. recta was significantly more prevalent in hiv periodontitis. these data suggest that the hiv gingivitis lesion is a precursor to hiv periodontitis. thus, early identification and prophylactic treatment of high-risk individuals may prevent the destruction of periodontal tissues.

AB  == the present study characterized the microbial profiles of the gingival sulci in children. subgingival samples from 36 gingivitis lesions of 18 patients and 36 sites in 18 healthy persons were examined. the tested individuals were divided into three stages according to physiological maturation i.e. early childhood, school age, circumpuberty. puberty was confirmed through examination of wrist radiographs. using continuous anaerobic techniques, samples were dispersed, diluted and then inoculated on selective and nonselective media and cultured under the condition appropriate gaseous phase respectively. isolates were identified microbiologically and counted. all values were evaluated statistically. the samples were simultaneously examined by dark-field microscopy. changes in the proportions and the frequency of periodontophathic bacteria were distinct in different stages of physiological maturation. black-pigmented bacteroides species were commonly found in gingivitis lesions. bacteroides intermedius was frequently detected in the subgingival samples from children with gingivitis. in all stages, the proportion of black-pigmented bacteroides and b. intermedius in the gingivitis groups were found to be significantly higher than that of the healthy groups. statistical analysis revealed that levels of b. intermedius increased in circumpuberty stage compared with the 2 younger stages.  black-pigmented bacteroides and b. intermedius were closely related to gi, pli in 3 stages. bacteroides gingivalis was found only in two gingivitis sites of a circumpubertal child with gingivitis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 4 out of 12 sites in the school age group, and in 6 out of 12 sites in the circumpuberty group with gingivitis respectively. in the circumpuberty group, the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans in the gingivitis group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was closely related to gi, pli, ci, ppd. eikenella corrodens was found to be associated with gingivitis in the school age and circumpuberty groups. no correlation was found in the detection of fusobacterium nucleatum in 3 stages. microscopic examination showed that the proportion of rods, fusiforms, filaments, motile rods, spirochetes in the gingivitis groups was significantly higher than that of the healthy groups, while the proportion of cocci in gingivitis groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy groups in 3 stages. spirochetes  were closely related to gi, pli, ppd in all stages.

AB  == oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. have been associated with destructive periodontal infection. neutrophils play a critical role in defending the periodontium against destructive infection. defensins are antimicrobial peptides that have been isolated in human, rabbit, guinea pig, and  rat leukocytes that may constitute an important nonoxidative mechanism of killing. the purpose of this study was to examine the sensitivity of a battery of oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria to the bactericidal effects of the isolated rabbit peptide np-1. all species tested were killed by np-1; however, there was strain-to-strain variation in sensitivity. the bactericidal effect was  not dependent on net bacterial growth, although metabolic activity was evident as assessed by bacterial oxygen consumption. we conclude that bacteria are sensitive to the cidal mechanism involved in defensin-mediated bacterial killing and that the conditions of this assay system support the killing of bacteria by the defensin peptides.

AB  == in this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. during 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls  10 times. at the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the papillary bleeding index (pbi). a total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean pbi scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). the mean proportion of actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). among the species discriminated, only capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of pbi (p less than = 0.05). the detection frequencies of black-pigmented bacteroides (particularly b. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). these findings implicate capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.

AB  == in this study; the relationship of indicators of the local host response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) to the serum antibody titer to periodontal pathogens was examined. 15 patients with chronic adult periodontitis were studied. gcf was collected and analyzed for the total amount of igg, igm, the lysosomal enzyme b-glucuronidase (bg) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha 2m). at the same examination, serum from these patients was collected, and enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assays used to determine the serum igg antibody titer to a panel of 17 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3 strains), bacteroides gingivalis (4), eikenella corrodens (2), wolinella recta, bacteroides intermedius (3), fusobacterium nucleatum, and 3 capnocytophaga species). using spearman rank order correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated to relate the 4 indicators of host response in gcf to the serum igg antibody titer to each of the 17 micro-organisms. the mean correlation between total igg in gcf and the serum igg antibody titer was positive (r = +0.30), and statistically significant correlations between total igg in gcf and serum igg antibody titer were observed for one strain of b. intermedius and c. ochracea. a  weaker positive correlation was observed for igm (r = 0.18). in contrast, the mean correlation between total bg in gcf and the serum antibody titer was negative (r = -0.34). statistically significant negative correlations were observed for all 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, one strain of e. corrodens and w. recta. the mean correlation for alpha 2m was r = -0.06. these data suggest that elevated bg activity in gcf, believed to be a marker for lysosomal enzyme released from polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the crevicular environment, may be associated with a reduced serum igg antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens. furthermore, these findings imply that the development of a serum igg antibody response to suspected periodontal pathogens is consistent with a protective host response.

TI  == evaluation of the activity of four antimicrobial agents using an in vitro rapid micromethod against oral streptococci and various bacterial strains implicated in periodontitis.
AB  == the activity of various antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, josamycin, doxycycline and metronidazole) was established in vitro using a rapid micromethod. the activity of these agents, which are widely used in oral medicine, was evaluated against microorganisms responsible for periodontitis and bucco-dental infections. their action against alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including pneumococci) which make up the majority of the indigenous oral flora was also tested. amoxicillin was found to be effective against all the strains tested. doxycycline was active  against periodontal bacteria, but not against 50% of the streptococcal flora. josamycin was found to be effective against streptococci, but appeared without effect on eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. metronidazole, inactive against streptococci, displayed greater activity towards  the strict anaerobes. the use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bucco-dental infections, especially periodontitis, is discussed. for periodontitis and periodontal suppurations, antimicrobial agents present a valuable adjunct to local treatments such as scaling or rootplaning. this may prevent more serious infections such as endocarditis that can develop after tooth extraction.

TI  == restriction endonuclease analysis of eikenella corrodens.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a gram-negative facultative bacillus commonly found in the oral cavity. although the role of e. corrodens in periodonititis is not clear, its isolation from extraoral infections attests to its pathogenic potential. previous studies suggested that this species is phenotypically diverse. in the present study, we used restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) to assess the genetic diversity of this species and to explore the applicability of rea in studying the transmission of e. corrodens. two groups of e. corrodens isolates were used in this study. group 1 included 47 epidemiologically independent isolates recovered from dental plaques in periodontally healthy subjects and periodontitis patients and from extraoral infections in different geographic areas. group 2 e. corrodens included 40 isolates recovered from two periodontitis patients and two periodontally healthy subjects. the results indicated that e. corrodens is genetically heterogeneous, as determined by rea. the majority of the group 1 e. corrodens isolates exhibited strain-specific restriction patterns. forty restriction patterns were distinguishable among the 47 isolates. analyses of group 2 isolates revealed that three of four subjects harbored more than one clonal type of e. corrodens. in one instance, a periodontitis patient was found to be colonized by six different clones. furthermore, two different clonal types  of e. corrodens were recovered from a single periodontal pocket in this patient.  the results indicated that rea may be a useful tool in the epidemiologic investigation of e. corrodens infections.

TI  == dna homologies shared among e. corrodens isolates and other corroding bacilli from the oral cavity.
AB  == in a previous microbiological study of eikenella corrodens, we noted the presence of e. corrodens strains with variability in colony morphology, as well as other corroding bacilli phenotypically similar to e. corrodens but which were unidentifiable on the basis of biochemical reactions. this raised questions as to whether e. corrodens constitutes a genetically heterogeneous group of organisms,  and whether the unidentified corroding bacilli represent atypical e. corrodens or genetically unrelated organisms. in the present study, the genetic relationship among 14 e. corrodens isolates and 6 unidentified corroding bacilli was examined. dna base compositions were determined from the melting temperatures of dna samples. dna homologies among e. corrodens and corroding bacilli were determined  by dna hybridization in solution using s1 nuclease. the % g + c content of e. corrodens strains varied from 56 to 58%, and from 56 to 60% for unidentified corroding bacilli. the dna homologies among 12 e. corrodens isolates and 2 reference strains varied from 57 to 97%. although these e. corrodens isolates exhibited variabilities in colony morphology and biochemical profile, no subspecies was identified. the unidentified corroding bacilli shared less than 33% homology with either of the e. corrodens reference strains. these corroding bacilli were further divided into 3 species on the basis of dna hybridization studies using radiolabeled dna from 2 representative corroding bacilli. one of the unidentified corroding bacilli appears to be a component of the normal flora  in the human oral cavity. our results indicate that e. corrodens is a genetically homogeneous species containing no recognizable subspecies.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  == progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may  frequently be involved. such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. adhesins of actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in  solution. cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. thus, several bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii and bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase.  similarly, the adhesion of some gram-negative bacteria, such as bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. it seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic  bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.

TI  == eikenella corrodens in the human oral cavity.
AB  == the prevalence and distribution of the putative periodontal pathogen eikenella corrodens in the human oral cavity was examined. a total of 508 oral bacterial samples were taken from 10 periodontally healthy adults (ph), 11 adult periodontitis patients (ap), and 6 localized juvenile periodontitis patients (ljp). from each subject, samples of supra- and subgingival plaque were obtained  from six to eight teeth as well as samples from buccal mucosa, lateral and dorsal surfaces of tongue, tonsil, and saliva. e. corrodens was cultured from 70% of healthy subjects and 100% of periodontitis patients. dental plaque appears to be  the main oral ecological niche of e. corrodens in ph subjects since it was found  in, respectively, 26% and 31% of supra- and subgingival plaque samples and rarely found in other oral sites in these subjects. it was found in 59% of both supra- and subgingival plaque samples from ap subjects, as well as 48% and 64% of supra- and subgingival plaque samples of ljp subjects. in contrast to healthy subjects,  e. corrodens was found on the buccal mucosa, tongue, tonsil and in the saliva of  patients with periodontitis. the microorganism constituted, on average, 1% to 2%  of the total cultivable bacteria in supra- and subgingival plaque samples. the prevalence of e. corrodens in plaque samples was higher in ap and ljp subjects and was significantly different from ph subjects. within the ap group, the prevalence of e. corrodens in subgingival plaque is significantly higher from sites with gi greater than or equal to 2. these data suggest that e. corrodens is an indigenous oral microorganism which may be an opportunistic pathogen associated with gingival inflammation.

TI  == [microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  == if disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. one hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of  indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. the levels of serum igg antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. the clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of b. gingivalis  was the highest among six bacterial species tested. a. actinomycetemcomitans, e.  corrodens and f. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. the proportion of b. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. b. gingivalis and b. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of a. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to b. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to a. viscosus than those of healthy persons. antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. after periodontal therapy, antibody levels to b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to a. viscosus increased to a slight degree. b. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. the proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. the results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring b. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum igg antibody titer against this organism may aid in  the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.

TI  == effect of clindamycin on neutrophil killing of gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == periodontal diseases are infections of the tissues supporting the dentition. recognition that relatively specific microfloras are associated with distinct clinical forms of periodontal disease has prompted the use of antimicrobial agents as adjuncts in periodontal therapy. clindamycin is one of several antibiotics known to concentrate in bioactive form in neutrophils and to potentiate phagocyte bactericidal activity against certain bacteria. neutrophils  appear to play a key role in host defense against periodontopathic gram-negative  bacteria. in the present study, we evaluated the effect of preincubation of neutrophils with therapeutically achievable concentrations of clindamycin upon subsequent in vitro bactericidal activity against three species of gram-negative  periodontal bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea. in each instance, clindamycin neither enhanced nor inhibited the kinetics of bactericidal activity at low bacterium-neutrophil multiplicities. further, this antibiotic had no demonstrable effect upon neutrophil bactericidal capacity, as assessed at bacterium-neutrophil ratios as high as 50:1. our results indicate that clindamycin does not potentiate neutrophil bactericidal activity against the species of gram-negative periodontal organisms tested.

AB  == in edentulous patients, the microbial colonization of permucosal implants of sintered hydroxyapatite was studied. samples were taken from mucosa and dentures  before insertion of implants and from supra- and subgingival sites two to 10 weeks after insertion. in total, five patients and 10 implants with clinically healthy peri-implant tissues were studied. the samples were investigated by dark-field microscopy and anaerobic culture. the supragingival plaque of the implants was dominated by gram-positive cocci and rods, the subgingival plaque by haemophilus spp. and veillonella parvula. a group of bacteria was found specifically related to the implants: actinomyces odontolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena, and leptotrichia buccalis. black-pigmented bacteroides was not found in any of the examined samples. spirochetes were observed in denture plaque samples and in supragingival plaque of the implants. it is concluded that bacteria known as potential periodontal pathogens colonize the permucosal implants in the first weeks after insertion. the presence of these species seems to be dependent on the ecological factors provided by the artificial gingival crevice of the permucosal implants in the edentulous mouth.

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.

TI  == human serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms. iv. correlation with homologous infection.
AB  == recent microbiological studies of periodontal disease in humans have supported the concept of a specific bacterial etiology. while individual agents have not been unequivocally identified, numerous gram-negative members of the subgingival  microflora have been implicated. in addition, elevations in systemic antibody responses have been consistent with certain oral microorganisms being involved in an infectious process associated with the disease. this report delineates the relationship between elevated systemic antibody levels and oral colonization with the homologous microorganism at active disease sites. thirty-four patients with various types of periodontal disease were examined. using elisa, each patient was shown to have an elevated antibody response to at least one organism from a battery of 18 oral microorganisms that were tested. subsequently, subgingival plaque was cultured from disease-active and -inactive sites of each subject. the  results demonstrated that the same microorganism to which the individual exhibited elevated serum antibody responses was detected in nearly 55% of the disease-active sites, while only 18% of the inactive sites showed the microorganism. certain microorganisms including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and wolinella  recta were primarily or exclusively correlated with active disease lesions. these findings support the hypothesis that elevated systemic antibodies to periodontopathic bacteria are reflective of subgingival colonization and exist as a response to a bacterial infection at disease-active sites.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of hydrogen peroxide and sodium bicarbonate individually and in combination against selected oral, gram-negative, facultative bacteria.
AB  == the topical application of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and sodium bicarbonate (nahco3), individually and in combination, has been used empirically in the treatment of periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined both minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of  these disinfectants individually and in combination against selected facultative, gram-negative oral bacteria in a microtiter dilution assay. the bacteria studied  included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga gingivalis. these bacteria exhibited mbc (one hr) values ranging from 75 mumol/l to greater than 10 mmol/l and mic from less than 5 to 500 mumol/l for h2o2. the tested bacteria exhibited mic values for nahco3 of from 23 to 182 mmol/l, and the mbc (one hr) exceeded 728 mmol/l for most of the strains examined. at sublethal (sub-mic) concentrations, sodium bicarbonate antagonized the ability of h2o2 to inhibit bacterial growth in mic assays, but sublethal concentrations of h2o2 had no effect on the mic values of nahco3. lethal concentrations of h2o2 and nahco3 exhibited synergistic antimicrobial activity in combination in one-hour bactericidal assays. since the bactericidal properties of these antimicrobial agents are synergistic, we conclude that it may be rational to use them in combination to treat certain forms of periodontal disease. also, lower and perhaps safer concentrations of h2o2 can be used in combination with nahco3 when oxidative antimicrobial chemotherapy is indicated.

TI  == eikenella corrodens.
AB  == eikenella corrodens is a microaerophilic gram-negative rod which is a normal inhabitant of human mucosal surfaces, particularly the oral cavity. although an uncommon cause of infection, it is by no means rare. it is found most often as part of a mixed infection, particularly with streptococci, but is capable of independently causing serious infection in both normal and immunocompromised hosts. given its slow growth, requirement for hemin when grown aerobically, and preference for co2 enrichment, it is likely that the involvement of eikenella in  an infection is not always recognized, and it would be prudent to alert the laboratory in situations where isolation of eikenella is likely (especially in head and neck infections or infected wounds caused by a human bite). although mixed infections which include eikenella may resolve with treatment directed at the other infecting organisms, treatment of such infections with antibiotics to which eikenella is resistant may result in a pure eikenella infection. such an outcome may occur, for example, when a human bite wound is treated with clindamycin or metronidazole. among the oral antibiotics, penicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol are generally effective, whereas cephalexin, dicloxacillin and their relatives are not. cefoxitin and the third-generation cephalosporins are highly effective against eikenella.

AB  == anaerobic, agar-dilution, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 18 antibiotics are given for the numerically important bacterial groups from the human oral cavity. strains are divided into susceptibility categories using the guidelines for interpretation of mics suggested by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. these guidelines are based on data on antibiotic concentrations attainable in serum following various dosage regimens. mics are also compared with attainable gingival fluid levels where these are known. the highest percentages of strains were susceptible to tetracycline, with 89% of the  139 strains tested susceptible to serum levels and 97% conditionally susceptible  to attainable gingival fluid levels. ninety-eight percent of strains were conditionally susceptible to attainable gingival fluid levels of minocycline, but many strains, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, were only moderately susceptible to attainable serum levels of this tetracycline analogue.  carbenicillin was effective against most groups of organisms, with the important  exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans, at serum levels attainable with oral formulations of carbenicillin. only 2% of the total strains tested were resistant to penicillin, while 33% of strains were categorized as moderately susceptible. clindamycin was active against many strains of gram-negative bacteria but was not active against a. actinomycetemcomitans, some bacteroides, eikenella corrodens, or the anaerobic vibrios. metronidazole was active against a. actinomycetemcomitans, all five groups of oral bacteroides tested, and against capnocytophaga species. chloramphenicol was active against a. actinomycetemcomitans, but not against most of the other groups of oral organisms. nearly all groups contained strains non-susceptible to serum levels attainable with the usual doses of erythromycin, spiramycin, vancomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, or chlortetracycline; several strains were resistant to maximum attainable serum levels of each of these antibiotics except doxycycline.

AB  == in a study of members of a large family with a high prevalence of early-onset periodontitis, we sampled the subgingival microflora and characterized 40 isolates from each sample. we surveyed serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies reacting with any of a panel of 21 periodontal bacteria. the mother and 7 of her 13 children had early-onset periodontitis. bacteroides gingivalis was not detected in the subgingival flora of any affected  or unaffected family member, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from only one affected child. capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated from  five of seven affected children and from none of their normal siblings. we found  no significant differences among the floras from family members who had rapidly progressive, juvenile, and prepubertal forms of periodontitis. elevated levels of serum antibody reacting with one or more of the bacteria tested were found in all family members with disease, but in only one periodontally normal family member.  both children with prepubertal periodontitis had antibodies reacting with c. sputigena, a species not found in their subgingival floras, but with none of the  other bacteria tested. all remaining affected family members had antibodies to one or more serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans, and four had antibodies reacting with additional bacteria, including c. sputigena, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and haemophilus aphrophilus. sera from patients contained antibodies specific for putative periodontal pathogens not found in their pocket flora, and conversely, putative periodontal pathogens for which no serum antibodies were found frequently comprised a large proportion (10% or more) of the pocket flora. in no case were both the bacterium and its antibody found. these observations are suggestive of sequential infection in the early-onset forms of periodontitis and of induction of protective immunity against reinfection by the same microorganism.

TI  == api zym and api an-ident reactions of fastidious oral gram-negative species.
AB  == api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests were done on six oral species  which are difficult to characterize with conventional biochemical tests. "bacteroides forsythus, the "fusiform" bacteroides species (a. c. r. tanner, m. a. listgarten, m. n. strzempko, and j. l. ebersole, manuscript in preparation), is difficult to cultivate in broth media, yet it gave 15 positive tests in these  series. the tests were able to separate this new species from species of capnocytophaga and fusobacterium. "b. forsythus" reactions were similar but not identical to those of reference bacteroides species. positive reactions for alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and alpha-glucuronidase suggest that "b. forsythus" may be saccharolytic. it was the only species tested  which was trypsin positive. wolinella species, campylobacter concisus, b. gracilis, and eikenella corrodens are asaccharolytic, and characterization relies heavily on sensitivities to inhibitory agents. these species reacted weakly in the api zym and api an-ident enzymatic substrate tests, and the reactions were not useful for separating these species. the enzyme reactions differentiated wolinella recta and c. concisus from selenomonas sputigena, another oral motile but saccharolytic organism.

TI  == effect of subgingival scaling on systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms.
AB  == the effects of scaling and root planing treatment on systemic antibody responses  were studied in patients with periodontal disease and in normal subjects. immunoglobulin g antibody in serum to a battery of oral microorganisms was assessed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after treatment in 31 individuals. the majority (96%) of the diseased patients exhibited elevated antibody to one or more of the microorganisms before the scaling regime. significant increases in antibody levels in serum were noted in 16 of 19 patients after scaling, whereas only 2 of 12 nonscaled subjects showed similar changes during monitoring intervals of up to 3 years. the bacterial specificities of the  increases were found to differ among the patients; however, a significant correlation to preexisting elevated antibody levels was observed. peak levels of  responses were noted at approximately 2 to 4 months posttreatment; antibody returned to pretreatment levels by 8 to 12 months. the predominant organisms for  which changes were noted included the black-pigmented bacteroides spp., eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in 18 of 19 instances, the homologous microorganism was detected in the subgingival  plaque when elevated antibody was present after treatment. these findings indicated that specific changes in host systemic responses accompany scaling and  root planing treatment of periodontal disease patients. these alterations in the  host response may provide an additional means by which successful therapy can be  accomplished.

TI  == fatty acid composition and shwartzman activity of lipopolysaccharides from oral bacteria.
AB  == the composition and the nature of the linkage of fatty acids and the shwartzman activity of lipopolysaccharide (lps) preparations derived from oral gram-negative bacteria including bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides loesheii, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were examined. 3-hydroxylated and nonhydroxy fatty acids of various chain lengths were found in all of the lps preparations. all nonhydroxy fatty acids were found to be ester-bound, and part of the 3-hydroxy fatty acids in the lps of b. gingivalis, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were shown to be involved in ester linkage. it was also suggested that the hydroxy group of the ester-bound 3-hydroxy fatty acid of the lps of f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans is at least partly substituted by another fatty acid, but in the lps of b. gingivalis and e. corrodens it is not. the main amide-linked fatty acid of the lps of b. gingivalis, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was 3-hydroxyheptadecanoic, 3-hydroxydodecanoic, 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic, and 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid, respectively. the results of the shwartzman assay showed that the e. corrodens lps was the most active among the preparations tested, and that the shwartzman toxicity of bacteroides lps is extremely low.

TI  == the relationships between streptococcal species and periodontopathic bacteria in  human dental plaque.
AB  == the existence of antagonistic and commensal relationships between microorganisms  was investigated. the predominant cultivable flora in 172 plaque samples from active and non-active sites in 32 human subjects with destructive periodontitis was determined. the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms (bacteroides  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, wolinella recta, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and eikenella corrodens) in a site was correlated with the absence of certain viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus uberis and streptococcus intermedius), and vice versa. a strong commensal relationship was found between b. gingivalis and strep. intermedius. the second study involved 3 subjects with intractable periodontitis  whose plaque harboured large numbers of one or more of these periodontopathic organisms. this plaque contained fewer organisms capable of inhibiting the growth of the periodontopathic strains in vitro when compared with a clinically-healthy  control subject. intermediate levels of inhibitors were found in plaque taken from non-active lesions. the majority of inhibitors in plaque from the healthy control were viridans streptococci. hydrogen-peroxide production by these organisms appears to be the principal mechanism of growth inhibition for periodontopathic organisms. bacterial interactions may thus be causally related to both periodontal health and disease.

TI  == immunoglobulin g response to subgingival gram-negative bacteria in human subjects.
AB  == serum and gingival crevicular fluid from normal healthy adults and patients with  periodontitis were screened for immunoglobulin g antibodies to antigens from bacteroides gingivalis 381, bacteroides intermedius 24, bacteroides loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, eikenella corrodens 1073, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, and capnocytophaga sp. strain m-12. immunoglobulin g antibody titers to the antigens were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antibody levels to b. gingivalis in serum  and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly higher in the samples from patients with periodontitis than in samples from healthy individuals. although there were individual differences within patient groups, a positive correlation (p less than 0.01) was found between the serum immunoglobulin g levels to b. gingivalis and the development of periodontitis. the antibodies to f. nucleatum (p less than 0.05), e. corrodens (p less than 0.05), and a. actinomycetemcomitans were slightly higher in patients with periodontitis than in normal subjects. there were no remarkable differences between the two groups in titers to b. intermedius, b. loescheii, and capnocytophaga sp.

TI  == oral implantation of bacteroides asaccharolyticus and eikenella corrodens in conventional hamsters.
AB  == oral implantation of bacteroides asaccharolyticus 381-r' and eikenella corrodens  1073s-r, which are highly resistant to streptomycin, was examined in conventional hamsters. the hamsters' first molars were ligatured with cotton threads preimmersed in bacterial suspensions. bacterial inoculation was performed daily for 1 week, followed by a single weekly inoculation for 7 more weeks. hamsters were fed keyes' diet no. 2000 or ordinary powdered diet. bacterial recovery, gingival histological changes, and immunological response were checked 2, 5, and  8 weeks after the daily serial inoculation. b. asaccharolyticus 381-r' was recovered from all hamsters during the experiment (6.7 x 10(6) to 6.3 x 10(8) colony-forming units). e. corrodens 10735-r was recovered from the hamsters fed keyes' diet no. 2000 throughout the experimental period (2.4 x 10(5) to 1.2 x 10(6) colony-forming units), but not in the group fed the ordinary powdered diet. the histological changes in gingival tissues at the second week showed no differences among the control group, the b. asaccharolyticus-inoculated group, and the e. corrodens-inoculated group. however, by the eighth week, the inflammation persisted only in the bacteria-inoculated groups, especially in the  b. asaccharolyticus-inoculated group. a relatively increased serum antibody titer was also observed in the b. asaccharolyticus-inoculated group, but not in the e.  corrodens-inoculated group. these findings indicate that b. asaccharolyticus 381-r' and e. corrodens 1073s-r can be implanted in hamsters' oral cavity with the aid of cotton thread ligature. it was also suggested that b. asaccharolyticus may have some pathogenic role in the destruction of periodontal tissue in hamsters.

TI  == eikenella corrodens adherence to human buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == the mechanism of eikenella corrodens adherence to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro was studied. initial experiments to determine the optimal conditions for adherence of e. corrodens to buccal epithelial cells showed that adherence was dependent on time, temperature, bacterial concentration, and ph. different strains of e. corrodens varied in their ability to adhere, and strain 1073 showed the greatest ability in adherence. strain 1073 was selected for studies of adherence mechanisms. trypsin treatment or heating (100 degrees c, 10 min) of the bacterial cells abolished their capacity to adhere to buccal epithelial cells. treatment of buccal epithelial cells with trypsin also abolished adherence of e.  corrodens 1073, whereas neuraminidase treatment of buccal epithelial cells enhanced the adherence. the adherence was inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and restored by adding ca2+. the adherence was remarkably inhibited by sugars containing d-galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine. treatment of neuraminidase-treated epithelial cells with sodium metaperiodate or alpha- and beta-galactosidase did not decrease the adherence. these data suggest that adherence of e. corrodens 1073 to human buccal epithelial cells may require the interaction of lectin-like proteins on the bacterial surface with galactose-like  receptors on the surface of epithelial cells.

TI  == lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  == we assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. when the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. the actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas streptococcus sanguis, campylobacter, and eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. the response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. however, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides asaccharolyticus and treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. these results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease  states.

TI  == biological activity of the slime and endotoxin of the periodontopathic organism eikenella corrodens.
AB  == a partially purified water-soluble slime extract was obtained from two strains of the oral pathogen eikenella corrodens, designated cs10 a and cs10 b. endotoxin was also isolated from this organism by the phenol-water extraction procedure. assays including the local shwartzman skin reactivity, chicken embryo lethality,  limulus lysate clotting, spleen cell mitogenicity, and immune adjuvancy were used to test the biological properties of these two bacterial extracts. in each of these assay systems the endotoxins of the eikenella corrodens strains demonstrated the classical endotoxic responses. in contrast, the effect of slime  extract in the corresponding assays was either extremely low or absent with the exception of a very strong immunosuppressive effect. mice treated with slime extract showed a severely reduced immune response to sheep erythrocytes as measured by the hemolytic plaque-forming cell assay.

TI  == eikenella corrodens osteomyelitis, arthritis, and cellulitis of the hand.
AB  == eikenella corrodens was isolated from an orally contaminated hand wound which resulted in cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and arthritis. e corrodens is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacillus which only lately has received attention  as a possible pathogen. the organism grows characteristically as small, corroding, or pitting colonies on blood agar. it typically requires hemin or blood for reliable aerobic growth. oral contamination of wounds predisposes to infection with e. corrodens. the management of these infections includes treatment with an effective antibiotic and surgical debridement. because it is gram-negative, microaerophilic, and often difficult to isolate, infections caused by e corrodens may mimic those caused by gram-negative obligate anaerobes. however, e corrodens is resistant to clindamycin and lincomycin and sensitive to  most other commonly used antimicrobial agents.
