TI  == effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, ph, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. although several isolates of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterococcus, and the bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of escherichia coli, collinsela aerofaciense, eubacterium limosum, and clostridium perfringens could not. when fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. after the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of lactobacillus and streptococcus including enterococcus tended to increase. however, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including c. perfringens, decreased (p  < 0.05), and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas tended to decrease. moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. the fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p  < 0.05) on apple intake. these findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.

TI  == effect of aloe vera whole leaf extract on short chain fatty acids production by bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium infantis and eubacterium limosum.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of aloe vera whole leaf extract on pure and mixed human gut bacterial cultures by assessing the bacterial growth and changes in the production of short chain fatty acids. methods and results: bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium infantis, and eubacterium limosum were incubated with aloe vera extracts [0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%; (w/v)] for 24 and 48 h. short chain fatty acids production was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses. a significant linear increase in growth response to aloe vera supplementation was observed at 24 h for each of the bacterial cultures; however, only b. infantis and a mixed bacterial culture showed a significant positive linear dose response  in growth at 48 h. in pure bacteria cultures, a significantly enhanced dose response to aloe vera supplementation was observed in the production of acetic acid by b. infantis at 24 h and of butyric acid by e. limosum at 24 and 48 h. in  the mixed bacterial culture, the production of propionic acid was reduced significantly at 24 and 48 h in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas butyric acid production showed a significant linear increase. conclusions: the results indicated that aloe vera possessed bacteriogenic activity in vitro and altered the production of acetic, butyric and propionic acids by micro-organisms selected for the study. significance and impact of the study: the results of the study suggest that consumption of a dietary supplement, aloe vera, may alter the production of short chain fatty acids by human intestinal microflora.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == inhibitors of neisseria gonorrhoeae produced in liquid medium by bacteroides fragilis and eubacterium limosum.
AB  == indigenous micro-organisms of the urogenital flora including anaerobes can inhibit the in vitro growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae. bacteroides fragilis and eubacterium limosum strains known to inhibit the gonococcal growth on solid medium have been shown to produce their antigonococcal activities in liquid medium. concentrations of individual short-chain fatty acids produced by e. limosum strains were lower than the inhibitory concentrations reported for n. gonorrhoeae. b. fragilis strains produced propionic acids in amounts known to be  inhibitory to the gonococcus. furthermore, studies with e. limosum (ps11a) cultures incubated at 29 degrees c (200 ml, 50 l) and at 37 degrees c (200 ml) have shown that short-chain fatty acids were not the inhibitors since no correlation between the short-chain fatty acids and the antigonococcal activity was found throughout the growth of the cultures. moreover, the observed inhibitory activity of e. limosum was not due to ph change or to nutrient depletion of the medium. these observations coupled with the specificity of the antigonoccal activity produced by e. limosum suggest that it is different from previously reported gonococcal inhibitors of bacterial origin.
