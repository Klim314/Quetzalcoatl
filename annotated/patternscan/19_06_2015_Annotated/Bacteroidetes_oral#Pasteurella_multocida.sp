TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on tissue levels of toll-like receptor and cytokine mrnas in feline chronic gingivostomatitis and oral health.
AB  == feline chronic gingivostomatitis (fcgs) is an inflammatory disease of the oral cavity that causes severe pain and distress in affected cats. treatment methods are currently very limited. the aims of this study were to assess the feline innate immune response by investigating the levels of cytokine and toll-like receptor (tlr) mrnas in tissue biopsies of cats with and without fcgs, and to relate this to the presence or absence of putative oral pathogens identified previously within these cats. mucosal biopsies were collected from 28 cats with fcgs and eight healthy cats. the levels of tlr (tlr2, tlr3, tlr4, tlr7, tlr9) and cytokine (il-1beta, il-4, il-6, il-10, il-12, tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma) mrna was determined using quantitative pcr. in the fcgs group a statistically significant  increase was seen in tlr2, tlr7, tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma, il-1beta and il-6 mrna levels compared to the healthy group. in cats where tannerella forsythia was present, statistically significant increases were seen in tlr2, tlr4, tlr7, tlr9, tnf-alpha and il-1beta mrna levels compared to cats where this putative pathogen  was absent. statistically significant increases in mrna expression were also seen in cats harbouring feline calicivirus (fcv) (tlr2, il-1beta, il-6, ifn-gamma) and porphyromonas circumdentaria (tlr2, tlr3) compared to cats where these putative pathogens were absent. pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida and pseudomonas sp. did not significantly alter the expression of any tlr or cytokine mrnas when compared to animals who tested negative for these species, while cats colonised with p. multocida subsp. septica demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the expression of tlr7, tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma mrnas compared to cats free of this species. the expression of mrna for several tlrs and cytokines  is elevated in fcgs. a positive correlation was observed between clinical disease severity and the presence of fcv (p=0.001; rho=0.58). although the number of cats harbouring t. forsythia was low by comparison, 80% of samples in which it was present were from cases with the highest clinical disease severity. positive correlations with clinical disease severity were seen for tlr2 (p=0.00086), tlr7  (p=0.049), tnf-alpha (p=0.027), ifn-gamma (p=0.0015), il-1beta (p=0.004) and il-6 (p=0.00001) mrnas. the putative pathogens fcv and t. forsythia may be important in stimulating a host immune response to fcgs and may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

TI  == identification of bacteria associated with feline chronic gingivostomatitis using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == feline chronic gingivostomatitis (fcgs) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the  oral cavity that causes severe pain and distress. there are currently no specific treatment methods available and little is known regarding its aetiology, although bacteria are thought to play a major role. the purpose of this study was to identify the oral bacterial flora in normal and diseased cats. oral swabs were obtained from the palatoglossal folds of eight cats (three normal and five fcgs)  and were subjected to microbiological culture. pasteurella pneumotropica and pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida were the most prevalent species identified by culture methods in the normal and fcgs samples, respectively. bacteria were also identified using culture-independent methods (bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing). for the normal samples, 158 clones were analysed and 85 clones were  sequenced. capnocytophaga canimorsus (10.8% of clones analysed) was the predominant species. uncultured species accounted for 8.2% of clones analysed, and 43.7% of clones analysed represented potentially novel species. for the fcgs  samples, 253 clones were analysed and 91 clones were sequenced. the predominant species was p. multocida subsp. multocida (51.8% of clones analysed). uncultured  species accounted for 8.7% of clones analysed, and 4.7% of clones analysed represented potentially novel species. it is concluded that the oral flora in cats with fcgs appears to be less diverse than that found in normal cats. however, p. multocida subsp. multocida is found to be significantly more prevalent in fcgs than in normal cats and consequently may be of aetiological significance in this disease.

TI  == bacteriology of periodontal disease in the cat.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 32 cats showing different stages of periodontal disease. correlations were sought between gingival index scores and the prevalence of various microbial groups, and between microbial populations found in sites designated as most-affected and least-affected within individual cats. the tendency with higher gingival index scores, and with the most-affected  sites, was toward a microbial population composed to a greater extent of anaerobic gram-negative rods. the most common organism was an anaerobic gram-negative rod in the black-pigmented bacteroides group that was biochemically similar to b. gingivalis but had catalase activity. the black-pigmented bacteroides group and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were found in increasing numbers with increasingly severe periodontal disease. pasteurella multocida was isolated from most samples and appeared to decrease in numbers with increasing periodontal disease.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.
