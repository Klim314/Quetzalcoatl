TI  - Radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria at small or large radiographical lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. Lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). A risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. Overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). An increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at large abscess lesions was observed for Prevotella (P.) oralis, P. buccae, P. oris, P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus (Strep.) anginosus group. An increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for Strep. salivarius, Strep. parasanguis, Strep. anginosus group, Capnocytophaga spp., Neisseria (N.) sicca, Neisseria spp., Staphylococcus (Staph.) aureus, P. intermedia, P. buccae, Prevotella spp. and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSIONS: The radiography-based score suggests that certain Prevotella spp., F. nucleatum and Strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, Neisseria spp., Capnocytophaga spp., Staph. aureus and Prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.
TI  - Molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - The human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. This study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. An in-depth 16S rRNA gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. A complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. This included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found in all samples regardless of age and health status. Yet, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected in children. In contrast, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. Obligate anaerobes like Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of Porphyromonas and Prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Tannerella forsythia. Unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus intermedius and Prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were scarce. The findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. The study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.
TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - Botryomycosis presenting as nasal cutaneous fistulas caused by Prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  - Botryomycosis is an uncommon chronic suppurative granulomatous bacterial infection that can affect the skin and viscera. Clinically, lesions typically consist of small tender nodules from which draining sinuses may develop to expel a purulent discharge. Histopathological features include characteristic aggregation of microorganisms (grain) within the inflammatory infiltrate. The commonest causative organisms are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, of others. Botryomycosis resulting from Prevotella melaninogenica has not been reported previously. We report the case of a middle-aged patient with botryomycosis presenting as nasal cutaneous fistulas caused by P. melaninogenica, which was successfully treated with surgical intervention combined with systemic antibiotic treatment.
TI  - The role of bacteria in oral cancer.
AB  - Despite the widening interest in the possible association between bacteria and different stages of cancer development, our knowledge in its relation to oral cancers remains inadequate. The aim of this review article is to derive a better understanding on the role of various micro-organisms in the etiogenesis of oral cancers through all the available data on the pubmed. Different bacteria have been proposed to induce carcinogenesis either through induction of chronic inflammation or by interference, either directly or indirectly, with eukaryotic cell cycle and signaling pathways, or by metabolism of potentially carcinogenic substances like acetaldehyde causing mutagenesis. Studies have shown diversity of isolated bacterial taxa between the oral cancer tissue specimens and the control, with Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus and Veillonella parvula being specific for tumorogenic tissues. Most isolates are saccharolytic and acid tolerant. Streptococcus anginosus, commonly linked with esophageal and pharyngeal cancers, is not of significance in oral cancers. Similarly, significant salivary specificity is noted for three bacteria, namely, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, P. melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis in oral cancer patients, making these species salivary markers for the early detection of oral cancers and thus improving the survival rate significantly. Also, such high degree of bacterial specificity in oral cancers has also provoked the designing of new treatment options for cancer prevention by way of vaccine delivery. However, for the success of these steps, a deeper exploration into this subject with a greater understanding is warranted.
TI  - Oral microbial and respiratory status of persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disability: an observational cohort study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of select  microorganisms in oral biofilms and to investigate relationships between oral and respiratory status in persons with mental retardation/intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a 6-month-long observational cohort study with 63 persons with IDD. Oral examinations, oral sampling, and medical record reviews were performed at baseline and then monthly. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze all baseline oral samples for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Prevotella melaninogenica, and Candida albicans. PCR analyses were also performed on participants' samples collected in the month before being diagnosed with a respiratory infection. RESULTS: All subjects had P. melaninogenica detected by PCR in their oral samples. Fifty-five percent (35 of 63) of participants had S. pneumoniae, MRSA, and C. albicans in their oral samples at baseline. No dental decay was detected clinically, oral hygiene was fair, and dysphagia was common. During the 6 months of the study, there were 22 respiratory infections (35% of participants)-12 pneumonias, 7 sinusitis, 1 bronchitis, and 1 upper respiratory tract infection. Participants with microorganisms in their baseline samples were significantly more likely to develop any respiratory infection and those who had poor oral status were significantly more likely to develop pneumonia. Almost 60% of participants who developed respiratory infections had the same microorganism detected in the sample collected in the month before infection as had been detected in their baseline sample. CONCLUSION: Potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity and poor oral status significantly increased the risk of developing respiratory infections, including pneumonia, in persons with IDD. The results suggest that colonization with these microorganisms may persist despite routine tooth brushing. Meticulous comprehensive oral hygiene of the oral cavity may be needed to reduce oropharyngeal microbial load.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Fluid-containing emphysematous bullae: a spectrum of illness.
AB  - Fluid-containing emphysematous bullae are an under-reported complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The roles of bronchoscopy in the work-up and of antibiotics in the treatment are undefined. This study reports the combined results from the analysis of 16 cases treated at the present authors' institution and 36 previously reported cases. The median age at presentation was 58 yrs and the median duration of follow-up was 60 weeks. A third of the patients were asymptomatic, while two-thirds presented with symptoms, including 10% who had evidence of a severe lung infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were cultured from the bullae fluid in three symptomatic patients. Sputum and blood cultures were uninformative. Bronchoscopy, performed in two-thirds of the cases, added no diagnostic information. Antibiotic treatment did not result in a more rapid resolution of the air fluid level. Percutaneous drainage was safe and effective in four patients. In conclusion, patients with fluid-containing bullae present with a spectrum of illness. Antibiotic treatment does not hasten radiographic resolution and bronchoscopy has no diagnostic or therapeutic role.
TI  - Periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type I: report of three cases within a family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentin dysplasia type I (DDI) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. It is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (PAL). In this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of DDI but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. METHODS: A 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of DDI. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The mother presented 34.9% of sites with PD > or =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with CAL > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with BOP; both daughters presented no sites with PD or CAL >3 mm and <10% of sites with BOP. Microbiologic analysis detected Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. The daughters showed high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (Fusobacterium periodonticum and F. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (Streptococcus gordonii) and purple (Veillonella parvula) complexes. The mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (N. mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Treponema denticola, and V. parvula). CONCLUSION: A combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid PAL and to provide oral health in patients with DDI.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - Bacteriological study of paediatric and adult chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is one of the commonest illnesses in ENT  practice which requires medical attention all the more in children of poor socio-economic status having in past inadequate treatment and negligent medical care. The present study was conducted to find out the various aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms associated with CSOM in paediatric and adult cases and their current antimicrobial susceptibility pattern as a guide to therapy. Samples were collected from 109 clinically diagnosed cases of CSOM and processed according to standard protocols. Out of 74 paediatric CSOM cases, 72 (97.2%) were bacterial culture positive while out of 35 adult CSOM cases, 28 (80%) were culture positive. Bilateral CSOM was slightly more common in adults (25%) than paediatric (21.4%) age group. Polymicrobial nature of CSOM was noted in both paediatric (70.8%) and adult (71.4%) cases while number of organisms isolated per lesion was slightly higher in adults (2.5) as compared to paediatric (1.95) cases. In paediatric CSOM, Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest aerobic isolate while in adult CSOM, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest one. Among anaerobes Peptostreptococcus spp. was commonest in CSOM where as Prevotella melaninogenica in adult CSOM. Sensitivity of S. aureus to cefuroxime was 72.2% while that of gram negative bacilli was higher to cefotaxime (90 to 100%). Among anaerobes higher sensitivity was seen to metronidazole (98.6%), clindamycin (95.7%) and chloramphenicol (98.6%). In view of the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM, prompt appropriate antimicrobial therapy can effectively reverse the disease process thereby preventing longterm sequelae.
TI  - A case of polymicrobial endocarditis caused by anaerobic organisms in an injection drug user.
AB  - Endocarditis is a serious complication of injection drug use most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. We report a case of tricuspid valve polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis in an injection drug user from 3 oral anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolytica, Veillonella species, and Prevotella melaninogenica. The patient was believed to have acquired these organisms from his habit of licking the needle in order to gauge the strength of the cocaine prior to injection. The patient was successfully treated with a 6-week course of penicillin G and metronidazole. This case demonstrates the importance of a detailed history in designing empiric therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  - This aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various Nigerian chewing sticks. Aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of C. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in Nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. All the extracts demonstrated activity against Staphylococcal and Streptococcal isolates. Over half of the extracts were active against Enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas gigivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii. Extracts of the Vitellaria paradoxa root, Bridellia ferruginea stem and twigs, Garcinia cola stem, Terminalia glaucescens root, Morinda lucida root, and Cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. The extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Relationship between volatile sulphide compounds concentration and oral bacteria  species detection in the elderly.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship between oral bacteria species detection and volatile sulphide compounds (VSC) concentration in the elderly. DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological and clinical VSC examination of elderly. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-seven elderly people aged 75, who were functionally independent and dentate. METHODS: VSC (H2S and CH3SH) concentrations in the mouth air of subjects were measured using portable gas chromatography. Oral bacteria samples were taken from dental plaque and identification of bacteria species was accomplished using standard methods. RESULTS: Fewer than 20% of subjects showed more than 10 ng/10 ml of H2S (severe odour level). The detection rate of P. melaninogenica was significantly higher in elderly people with more than 10 ng/10 ml (p=0.043) levels. Fusobacterium had a tendency to be found in those with more than 10 ng/10 ml, but a significant relation was not found. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Fusobacterium and P. melaninogenica may be involved in the production of H2S in the oral cavity of elderly people.
TI  - Clinical presentation and bacteriologic analysis of infected human bites in patients presenting to emergency departments.
AB  - Previous studies of infected human bites have been limited by small numbers of patients and suboptimal microbiologic methodology. We conducted a multicenter prospective study of 50 patients with infected human bites. Seventy percent of the patients and assailants were young adult men. Fifty-six percent of injuries were clenched-fist injuries and 44% were occlusional bites. Most injuries were to the hands. Fifty-four percent of patients were hospitalized. The median number of isolates per wound culture was 4 (3 aerobes and 1 anaerobe); aerobes and anaerobes were isolated from 54% of wounds, aerobes alone were isolated from 44%, and anaerobes alone were isolated from 2%. Isolates included Streptococcus anginosus (52%), Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Eikenella corrodens (30%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (32%), and Prevotella melaninogenica (22%). Candida species were found in 8%. Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Candida species were isolated more frequently from occlusional bites than from clenched-fist injuries. Many strains of Prevotella and S. aureus were beta-lactamase producers. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and moxifloxacin demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against common isolates.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and moxifloxacin (Bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. In this investigation, we analyzed the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. Serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. These samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. Gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml), and F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against H. influenzae (MIC = 0.03 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml). Moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), H. influenzae (MIC = 0.015 micro g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 0.06 micro g/ml), F. nucleatum (MIC = 0.5 micro g/ml), Prevotella melaninogenica (MIC =0.5 micro g/ml), Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC = 0.125 micro g/ml), and Peptostreptococcus micros (MIC = 0.25 micro g/ml). The results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Microbiology of acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis and treatment with Taileqi troches].
AB  - A qualitative analysis of microflora from pharynx of 100 cases of acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis was performed. These patients were randomly divided into two groups so as to assess treatment effect of Taileqi troches vs Amoxycillin. Results showed that beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms causing diseases. The predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides melaninogenicus, eptostrep. These findings suggest that anaerobic bacteria may play a pathogenic role in infection of the pharynx. The effective rate of treatment with troche alone were 86 percent, roughly consistent with Amoxycillin group. No adverse effect was observed.
TI  - Pyomyositis of the thigh due to Prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  - Pyomyositis is an uncommon infection in temperate climates, however, it is being  more frequently reported among patients with diabetes or malignancy, or those who are immunocompromised. It is predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and rarely by Bacteroides species. Pyomyositis due to Prevotella melaninogenica has not previously been reported. We describe an elderly patient with pyomyositis of the thigh due to P. melaninogenica which was successfully treated by surgical incision and drainage in combination with metronidazole therapy.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in chronic inner ear infections in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically middle ear exudate obtained from 56 patients, aged 17 to 83 years, treated for chronic otitis media. Aerobic bacteria only were found 49 patients (87,5%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 7 patients (12,5%). The most common bacteria isolated from the middle ear exudate, in descending order frequency, were Staphylococcus aureus (45%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (34%), Proteus mirabilis (16%) and Prevotella melaninogenica (9%). Other organisms were isolated less frequently. In 34 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 22 patients the isolated bacteria coexisted with other microorganisms.
TI  - [Severe orbital cellulitis: therapeutic results in 9 patients and review of the literature].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orbital cellulitis can produce severe neuromeningeal infections. Modern antimicrobial agents such as imipenem can be a valid therapeutical choice. METHODS: Patients with severe or complicated orbital cellulitis admitted to our hospital from 1986 through 1994 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Nine patients with severe orbital cellulitis, seven of them older than 14 years, are reported. Cellulitis was secondary to different forms of sinusitis in five of them. The incriminated microorganisms were: Streptococcus viridans alone or combined to gram negative bacilli (3 cases), Prevotella melaninogenica and other anaerobes (2 cases), Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus (one case each). Three patients developed brain abscesses, one an acute bacterial meningitis and another a subdural empyema. Eight patients underwent a surgical drainage. Seven patients were treated with IV imipenem at doses of 2-3 g/day with complete cure of the orbital cellulitis and of the associated infectious complications and no secondary effects. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem is an effective antibiotic in the combined medical-surgical treatment of the severe or complicated orbital cellulitis.
TI  - Enhancement of growth of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in mixed infections  with aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for mutual enhancement of growth of group A  beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), and 11 commonly associated aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms frequently isolated in tonsillar infections. METHODS: Enhancement was assessed by measuring the relative increase in colony-forming units (CFU) of GABHS and each of the 11 microorganisms inducing a subcutaneous abscess in mice. RESULTS: Of the 11 combinations of GABHS and aerobe or anaerobe, GABHS was enhanced in 10 cases and the other microorganism in 5, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Prevotella melaninogenica and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the mutual symbiotic enhancement of growth of GABHS in the presence of other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (RTH), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (OTH). Mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). The highest recovery rate of organisms per tonsil was in patients with OTH (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in RT and 5.9 per tonsil in RTH. The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), Neisseria sp (16), Staphylococcus aureus (14), and Eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Fusobacterium sp (8), Bacteroides sp (7), and Prevotella melaninogenica (5). The number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). A higher concentration of S aureus and H influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (RTH and OTH) as compared to RT. These findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for H influenzae and S aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and without inflammation (RTH and OTH). Further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Head and neck space infections in infants and children.
AB  - A retrospective study was performed in 117 children with head and neck space infections treated at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from January 1986 through June 1992. Peritonsillar space infections were the most common (49%), followed by retropharyngeal (22%), submandibular (14%), buccal (11%), parapharyngeal (2%), and canine (2%) space infections. The most common pathogens isolated (N = 78) were the aerobes beta-hemolytic streptococcus (18%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18%), the anaerobes Bacteroides melaninogenicus (17%) and Veillonella (14%), and the gram-negative organism Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14%). beta-Lactamase production by aerobic pathogens was detected in 22% of cultures. Computed tomography scans (N = 16) were reviewed in blinded fashion and compared with operative findings. The sensitivity of computed tomography scan in detecting the presence of an abscess vs. cellulitis was high (91%), whereas the specificity was rather low (60%). Treatment of head and neck space infections in children should consist of accurate physical diagnosis aided by imaging studies, empiric antibiotic therapy that covers gram-negative and beta-lactamase--producing organisms as well as gram-positive organisms and anaerobes, and timely surgical intervention, when indicated.
TI  - [The use of solid-phase immunoenzyme analysis for the diagnosis of a suppurative  infection of the maxillofacial area caused by Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - In 186 patients with odontogenic infection the level of antibodies to B.melaninogenicus polysaccharide antigen, teichoic acid and S.aureus polysaccharide was determined in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The positive values of ELISA indices were found to coincide with the data of bacteriological study in more than 90% of cases. The role of B.melaninogenicus and S.aureus associations in the development of purulent infections was confirmed with the use of ELISA in 34.2% of the patients for S.aureus and in 50% of the patients for B.melaninogenicus and bacteriologically in 31.4% and 46.9% of the patients respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic-supplemented bone allograft in a rabbit model.
AB  - The use of an antibiotic-supplemented bone allograft (ASBA) as a material for placement in infected mandibular fractures was investigated in a rabbit model. In phase I of this project, fractures were created in the mandibles of 30 New Zealand white rabbits and injected with 5 x 10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. The animals were divided into three treatment groups (A, B, or C) and treated with conventional treatment (CT), CT plus demineralized bone powder, or CT plus ASBA. In phase II, bone defects were created in the mandibles of 17 New Zealand white rabbits and then grafted with ASBA. Assessment of healing and vascular ingrowth was made at 2-day intervals through 3 weeks postoperatively, and then weekly until termination at 60 days postoperatively. Phase I results showed significantly enhanced healing in the ASBA-treated group when compared with the other treatment methods and healed fracture strength, which was comparable to the nonfractured, contralateral mandibular angle. Phase II results demonstrated vascular structures in the ASBA material by 4 days postoperatively and osteogenesis by 12 days postoperatively.
TI  - Isolation of anaerobes from bubo associated with chancroid.
AB  - Ten men with bubo associated with chancroid were studied for bacterial flora especially anaerobes. Anaerobes were isolated from all 10 buboes and eight out of 10 ulcers of chancroid. Anaerobic cocci, B melaninogenicus and B fragilis were the most common isolates. anaerobes probably play a role in the pathogenesis of bubo in chancroid.
TI  - Quantitative bacterial cultures and beta-lactamase activity in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 54 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty aerobic and 81 anaerobic isolates were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were involved in 20 patients (37%), and anaerobic organisms only in seven (13%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 27 patients (50%). The most common bacteria isolated were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. There were 45 beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB), 30 aerobes, and 15 anaerobes recovered from 38 patients (70%). beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 30 of the 38 ear aspirates (79%) that contained BLPB. All but one of these organisms were in excess of 10(4) colony-forming units/mL. The detection of beta-lactamase activity in the ear aspirates provides evidence of the role of BLPB in the failure of penicillin therapy to eradicate chronic ear infection.
TI  - The anaerobic and aerobic bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients with sickle-cell disease.
AB  - Leg ulcers in 26 patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) were studied bacteriologically over a period of 6 months. The average age of the patients was 20.92 years and the mean duration of the ulcers was 3.43 years. In order of frequency, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were the predominant organisms. Anaerobes were isolated from 14 (54%) of 26 patients and represent 21% of the total 77 isolates. The presence of anaerobes correlated well with odorous ulcers. Isolation of anaerobes from leg ulcers of patients with SCD has added to knowledge of bacterial infection in SCD.
TI  - Significance of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  - Organisms of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. The relative importance of these Bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. This was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. Clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by Bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. In almost all instances the aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated Bacteroides species. On the other hand, encapsulated B. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Encapsulated B. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as Escherichia coli and group D streptococci and less important than S. aureus, group A streptococci, and K. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. This study demonstrates that encapsulated Bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.
TI  - In vivo protection of penicillin-susceptible Bacteroides melaninogenicus from penicillin by facultative bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.
AB  - We investigated the possibility that beta-lactamase producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus can protect organisms of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group from penicillin. A mixed infection was induced in mice in the form of a subcutaneous abscess involving a penicillin-susceptible encapsulated B. melaninogenicus, and a beta-lactamase producing strain of either K. pneumoniae or S. aureus. The infected animals were treated for 7 days with single or combined antimicrobial therapy. The single agents used were penicillin, clavulanic acid, metronidazole, and gentamicin. The antimicrobial combinations were penicillin and clavulanic acid, penicillin and gentamicin, and metronidazole and gentamicin. Administration of a single agent was effective in treating abscesses caused by susceptible organisms. The only effective therapy for mixed infections was by combination therapy of penicillin and clavulanic acid or metronidazole and gentamicin. This study supports the hypothesis that beta-lactamase producing facultative bacteria may shield their anaerobic counterparts from penicillin therapy, thereby contributing to the persistence of the infection.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  - Aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). A total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). There were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including Hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and Staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). Fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and Propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).

TI  - Acute suppurative parotitis associated with anaerobic bacteremia.
AB  - Most episodes of acute suppurative parotitis are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Reported here is a patient who had acute parotitis associated with anaerobic sepsis caused by Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Peptostreptococcus micros. Acute parotitis should be included in the ever-widening spectrum of clinical infections caused by anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [The bacterial flora of preputial space].
AB  - The bacterial flora of the preputial space of 210 healthy males (43 children aged between 2 and 11 years, 137 males between 12 and 60 years and 30 men over 60 years) was determined by smears and cultueres from glans penis, sulcus coronarius and the adjacent prepuce. The results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. Differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. In the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. In the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases. Prevalent are gramnegative anaerobes, especially Bacterioides melaninogenicus, also enterococci, enterobacteria and coagulase-positive staphylococci.

TI  - Anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. Treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. The aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). There were 46 aerobic isolates. The aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) Proteus sp. (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (3). There were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and Bacteroides sp., the latter of which included Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). The patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). An aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. The clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. There were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. The above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.

TI  - Acute suppurative parotitis caused by anaerobic bacteria: report of two cases.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen in acute suppurative parotitis. Although anaerobic bacteria are prevalent in the normal oral and upper respiratory tract flora and frequently are involved in oral and facial infections, they have seldom been isolated from patients with suppurative parotitis. It may be that a role for anaerobes in parotitis has not been documented because of inadequate specimen transport or anaerobic culture techniques. We describe two cases of acute suppurative parotitis in which cultures yielded anaerobic bacteria. In one case, no aerobes were isolated; in the other, the anaerobe was the predominant organism numerically.
TI  - Penicillin resistance and penicillinase production in clinical isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of penicillin and six other antimicrobials were determined for 50 clinical isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Agar dilution susceptibilities were performed using supplemented brucella blood agar and the proposed National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards standard method for anaerobes; results with the two methods were comparable. A penicillin concentration >/=0.8 mug/ml was needed to inhibit 56% of the isolates, whereas 100% were susceptible to 0.1 mug of clindamycin per ml. All isolates with penicillin MIC values >/=0.8 mug/ml produced beta-lactamase using a slide method. A micro-iodometric assay was used to quantitate beta-lactamase production in six isolates. The beta-lactamase activity of B. melaninogenicus was comparable to that of a Staphylococcus aureus isolate but was not inducible, and the specific amount produced correlated only partially with penicillin MIC values. A clinical review of patients from whom the beta-lactamase-producing strains of B. melaninogenicus were isolated did not suggest any increased virulence in these strains or an unexpectedly poor clinical response to appropriate therapy.

TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
