TI  == effect of adjuncts on microbiological and chemical properties of scamorza cheese.
AB  == scamorza is a semi-hard, pasta filata cheese resembling low-moisture mozzarella cheese, with a short ripening time (<30d). scamorza has a bland flavor and, to provide diversification from similar cheeses, it was manufactured using 2 types of milk in the current study: 100% italian friesian milk (f) or 90% f and 10% jersey cow milk (mixed, m), and 2 types of starter: streptococcus thermophilus or s. thermophilus with peptidolytic lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei strains as adjuncts). the cheeses were ripened for 30d. the adjunct did not significantly affect acid production or growth of the primary starter; 2 of the species used in the adjunct (lb. paracasei and lb. helveticus) rapidly colonized the cheese and persisted until the end of ripening, whereas the counts of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in the control cheese were  low until the end of ripening. the use of adjuncts affected ph, microbial composition (as assessed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods), total free amino acid content, and volatile profile (measured using an  electronic nose), whereas milk type had only a minor effect. although differences in primary proteolysis were found, they were probably indirect and related to the effects on ph and moisture. we conclude that, even with a short ripening time (30d), use of a peptidolytic adjunct may significantly affect important features  of scamorza and may be used to create a product that is measurably different from competing products.

TI  == effect of adjuncts on sensory properties and consumer liking of scamorza cheese.
AB  == the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peptidolytic adjunct (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei), as a tool to accelerate ripening, on sensory properties and acceptability of scamorza  cheese obtained using 2 types of milk (friesian and friesian+jersey) and streptococcus thermophilus as primary starter. a 10-member panel was trained using a specific frame of references and used a specific vocabulary to assess cheese sensory properties through quantitative descriptive analysis (qda), whereas 87 consumers were used to evaluate product acceptability. analysis of variance showed that milk type did not markedly alter cheese sensory properties.  conversely, panelists perceived higher intensities of butter, saltiness, and sweetness flavors in cheese without adjunct culture (st), whereas the addition of the adjunct culture (st+a) induced higher and sourness flavors, oiliness and grainy textures, and lower adhesiveness, moisture, springiness, and tenderness. principal component analysis showed positive relationships between ph and tenderness, sweetness and saltiness and a negative correlation between ph and grainy, oiliness, color and structure uniformity, sourness, and milk. most of the differences observed in qda and most of the relationships observed in the principal component analysis were linked to the higher microbial activity induced by the adjunct culture. independently of milk and starter types, consumers perceived scamorza cheese as characterized by a good eating quality (mean liking  scores were all above the neutral point of the hedonic scale). although st cheeses showed higher values for overall liking, 2 homogeneous groups of consumers were identified using partial least squares regression analysis. one group preferred st cheeses with higher levels of tenderness, adhesiveness, springiness, and moisture in terms of texture, butter in terms of flavor, and sweetness in terms of taste, whereas a second group preferred st+a products characterized by specific attributes of texture (cohesiveness and oiliness), flavor (milk), taste (sourness), and appearance (structure and color uniformity). we conclude that further studies for the development of short-ripened products based on the use of adjunct cultures should be conducted to promote product differentiation and meet the sensory requirements of particular segments of consumers.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  == background: akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most west african countries. the identities of lab populations from dgge analysis and conventionally isolated lab and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by pcr sequencing analysis. the relationships between ph, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. results: the lab communities  in the akamu samples comprised mainly lactobacillus species, including lb. fermentum, lb. plantarum, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and lb. helveticus, as  well as lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. identified yeasts were candida tropicalis, candida albicans, clavispora lusitaniae and saccharomyces paradoxus.  low ph (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). ash was  either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kj g(-)(1). conclusion: the akamu samples were  predominantly starchy foods and had ph < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative lab.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == a survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  == kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in tibet (china). it is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. in this study, a bacterial 16s rrna gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total dna extracted from 30 samples of kurut. after screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (otu) with unique rflp patterns were obtained. then, 1 representative sequence of every otu was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. the representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and acetobacter. in addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in genbank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. the characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.

TI  == the spatial distribution of bacteria in grana-cheese during ripening.
AB  == the microbial composition and its spatial distribution of grana trentino, a hard  parmesan-like cheese, was determined, from vat milk to cheese. after cutting along the vertical axis of the cheese wheels, three layers were sampled diagonally across the cheese: under the cheese rind, an intermediate section and  the cheese core. after two different ripening periods (9 and 18 months), the cheese samples were analysed using traditional culture dependent and culture independent methods. milk samples were dominated by mesophilic and psychrophilic  bacterial counts. thermophilic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus) were found in  high amounts in cooked whey and natural whey starter cultures. after 9 months of  ripening, lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts were higher than those after 18 months. furthermore, the lab numbers in the cheese core was lower than those under the rind or in the intermediate section. the main lab species isolated from milk (lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, streptococcus uberis and lactococcus garvieae) were not found in the corresponding cheeses. some differences were observed in the species composition among the three cheese sections. microbiota under the rind and in the intermediate section was similar and dominated by lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the core, after 18 months of ripening, was characterized by a total absence of lab. in each sample, all lab were genotypically grouped and the different biotypes were subjected to several technological tests indicating that some non-starter lab (nslab) displayed technological features that are favorable for the production of grana trentino cheese.

TI  == the investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. we collected 66 samples of the traditional mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 lab strains were isolated and identified based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence. the predominant species of those products were lactobacillus (l.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and lactococcus lactis ssp.  lactis. however, we could not detect any lab strains from eezgii. all lab isolates were screened for tolerance to low ph and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to caco-2 cells. in vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as l. plantarum or l. paracasei subspecies, based on 16s ribosomal dna and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. these strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the dornogovi province.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

AB  == a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. fermentum, was developed. the target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (l. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (l. fermentum). the analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived  from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus and enterococcus genera. the identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)cfu/ml. this new molecular assay was used to investigate the lab  population by direct extraction of dna from the 12 whey cultures for grana padano. the pentaplex pcr assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor lab community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). target dna bands were identified  according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. comigrating bands present in the dgge profiles were resolved by species-specific pcr. the results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. the dominant lactic acid bacteria included lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. frequently encountered bacterial species were enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus kitasatonis, and lactobacillus kefiri. leuconostoc mesenteroides, streptococcus thermophilus,  lactobacillus buchneri, and lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. in addition, l. buchneri, l. jensenii, and l. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for  the first time in the xinjiang koumiss. furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on m17, de man-rogosa-sharpe, halligan-pearce, and kenner fecal media. the results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained  by the dgge analysis. this is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

AB  == the microbial diversity of sixty-three natural whey cultures (nwcs) for the manufacture of caciocavallo silano cheese pdo was studied. the nwcs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of pdo production including five different regions of southern italy. the microbial species diversity was determined by direct dna extraction from nwcs and polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplification of variable regions of the 16s rrna gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc). dgge and dhplc fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. the dhplc technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as dgge in profiling species diversity in nwcs. cluster analysis of dgge and dhplc data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the nwcs. the presence of three groups of 10-14 nwcs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the nwcs for caciocavallo silano cheese pdo. a rapd-pcr analysis of the nwcs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical nwcs included  different biotypes. the sequences of dgge bands and dhplc peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic lactococcus lactis also occurred in some nwcs. in conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of nwcs used for the  caciocavallo silano pdo cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. the microbiota of fermented pdo products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == characterization of n-deoxyribosyltransferase from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == a nucleoside n-deoxyribosyltransferase-homologous gene was detected by homological search in the genomic dna of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the gene yejd is composed of 477 nucleotides encoding 159 amino acids with only 25% identity, which is low in comparison to the amino acid sequences of the n-deoxyribosyltransferases from other lactic acid bacteria, i.e. lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus helveticus. the residues responsible for catalytic  and substrate-binding sites in known enzymes are conserved at gln49, asp73, asp93 (or asp95), and glu101, respectively. the recombinant yejd expressed in escherichia coli shows a 2-deoxyribosyl transfer activity to and from both bases  of purine and pyrimidine, showing that yejd should be categorized as a class ii n-deoxyribosyltransferase. interestingly, the base-exchange activity as well as the heat stability of yejd was enhanced by the presence of monovalent cations such as k(+), nh(4)(+), and rb(+), indicating that the lactococcus enzyme is a k(+)-activated type ii enzyme. however, divalent cations including mg(2+) and ca(2+) significantly inhibit the activity. whether or not the yejd gene product actually participates in the nucleoside salvage pathway of lc. lactis remains unclear, but the lactic acid bacterium possesses the gene coding for the nucleoside n-deoxyribosyltransferase activated by k(+) on its genome.

AB  == one hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in morocco using various cultured media. strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. results showed that high counts of lab were found. presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. results showed also  that lactobacillus and lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. the dominated species found were lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), lactobacillus helveticus (10%), streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and lactobacillus  plantarum (5%). this is the first report on the characterization of lab strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in morocco.

TI  == starter strain related effects on the biochemical and sensory properties of cheddar cheese.
AB  == a detailed investigation was undertaken to determine the effects of four single starter strains, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 303, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris hp, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris am2, and lactobacillus helveticus dpc4571 on the proteolytic, lipolytic and sensory characteristics of cheddar cheese. cheeses produced using the highly autolytic starters 4571 and am2 positively impacted on  flavour development, whereas cheeses produced from the poorly autolytic starters  303 and hp developed off-flavours. starter selection impacted significantly on the proteolytic and sensory characteristics of the resulting cheddar cheeses. it  appeared that the autolytic and/or lipolytic properties of starter strains also influenced lipolysis, however lipolysis appeared to be limited due to a possible  lack of availability or access to suitable milk fat substrates over ripening. the impact of lipolysis on the sensory characteristics of cheddar cheese was unclear, possibly due to minimal differences in the extent of lipolysis between the cheeses at the end of ripening. as anticipated seasonal milk supply influenced both proteolysis and lipolysis in cheddar cheese. the contribution of non-starter lactic acid bacteria towards proteolysis and lipolysis over the first 8 months of cheddar cheese ripening was negligible.

TI  == two 2[5h]-furanones as possible signaling molecules in lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == two 2[5h]-furanones, in association with medium-chain fatty acids, were released  in whey by lactobacillus helveticus exposed to oxidative and heat stresses. this  species plays an important role in cheese technology, particularly for swiss-type cheeses and grana cheese. moreover, it significantly contributes to cheese ripening by means of an early autolysis and the release of enzymes during processing. experimental evidence of the involvement of the two 2[5h]-furanones,  detected by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/solid-phase microextraction technique, in the autolysis phenomenon has been obtained. zymograms performed by  using renaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels were used to detect the bioactivity of the supernatants containing the two furanones on fresh cells of the same strain. in addition to bands corresponding to known autolysins, new autolysins were detected concomitant with the exposure of lactobacillus helveticus to the supernatants, which can be regarded as conditioned media (cm),  and to a commercial furanone, 5-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2[5h]-furanone (hemfi),  having spectral data similar to those of the newly described 2[5h]-furanones. morphological changes were observed when fresh cells were exposed to cm containing the two 2[5h]-furanones and hemfi. the two furanones produced by lactobacillus helveticus, which met a number of criteria to be included in cell-cell signaling molecules, have a presumptive molecular mass lower than those of already known 3[2h]-furanones having an autolytic activity and being produced  by gram-negative bacteria. moreover, they present a different chemical structure  with respect to the furanones already identified as products of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or to those identified in some cheeses with lactobacillus  helveticus as a starter culture.

TI  == construction and evaluation of food-grade vectors for lactococcus lactis using aspartate aminotransferase and alpha-galactosidase as selectable markers.
AB  == aims: we report development of two food-grade cloning vectors for lactococcus lactis, which utilize either a lactococcal aspartate aminotransferase gene (aspc), or bifidobacterium longumalpha-galactosidase gene (agll) as selectable markers. methods and results: the theta-replicon of lactococcal plasmid, pw563, was combined with aspc and a multiple cloning site. when electroporated into l. lactis jls400 (aspc-), the resulting vector, psuw611 (3.9 kbp), restores ability  of the mutant to grow in milk thus allowing for selection of the transformants. the vector is stable during 100 generations of nonselective growth (0.2% loss per generation). the second vector, psuw711 (5.1 kbp), was constructed by exchanging  aspc with agll under the control of usp45 promoter. lactococcus lactis transformed with psuw711 produced distinctive colonies within 48-72 h on melibiose-containing plates. expression of two lactobacillus helveticus peptidases was attempted using these new vehicles. introduction of pepn on psuw611 and psuw711 into l. lactis led to a sixfold, or 27-fold increase in aminopeptidase activity, respectively. however, no changes in endopeptidase activity were recorded upon transformation with psuw611 carrying pepo2 under control of three different promoters. attempts were also made to construct high copy variants of psuw711. conclusions: the aspc and agll can be employed as food-grade genetic markers for l. lactis. the vectors, psuw611 and psuw711, were  successfully used to express lact. helveticus pepn in l. lactis. significance and impact of the study: two novel food-grade vectors were developed which provide simple and convenient selection and maintenance in l. lactis.

TI  == potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from specific natural niches in food production and preservation.
AB  == autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been isolated from traditionally homemade cheeses collected from specific ecological localities across serbia and montenegro. genetic and biochemical analysis of this lab revealed that they produce bacteriocins, proteinases and exopolysaccharides. lab  produces a variety of antimicrobial substances with potential importance for food fermentation and preservation. apart from the metabolic end products, some strains also secrete antimicrobial substances known as bacteriocins. among the natural isolates of lab from homemade cheeses, bacteriocin producers were found in both lactococci and lactobacilli. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bgmn1-5 was found to produce three narrow spectrum class ii heat-stable bacteriocins. in addition to bacteriocin production, bgmn1-5 synthesized a cell envelope-associated proteinase (cep) and shows an aggregation phenotype. another  isolate, l. lactis subsp. lactis bgsm1-19 produces low molecular mass (7 kda) bacteriocin sm19 that showed antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus flavus and partially against salmonella paratyphi. production of bacteriocin reaches a plateau after 8 h of bgsm1-19 growth. bacteriocin sm19 retained activity within the wide ph range from 1 to 12 and after the treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. among collection of lactobacilli, the isolate lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgsj2-8 produces heat-stable bacteriocin sj (approx. 5 kda) polypeptide. it retained activity after treatment for 1 h at 100 degrees c, and in the ph range from 2 to 11. in addition to isolates from cheeses, bacteriocin-producing human oral lactobacilli were detected. most of them showed antimicrobial activity against streptococci, staphylococci and micrococci, but not against candida. isolate bgho1 that showed the highest antimicrobial activity was determined as l. paracasei. interestingly, lactobacillus helveticus bgra43, which was isolated from the human intestine showed strong activity against clostridium sporogenes, but it was not possible to detect any bacteriocin production in this isolate by using standard procedures. further analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that bgra43 has a relatively  broad spectrum. lactobacilli resistant to nisin were also detected among natural  isolates. they produce bacteriocins, which have no activity against nisin producing lactococci.

TI  == induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen a.
AB  == mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. the induction of protective iga in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. in this work, streptococcus pneumoniae psaa antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus helveticus. after nasal inoculation of c57bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (igg in serum) and mucosal (iga in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-psaa antibodies was determined. immunization with l. lactis mg1363 induced very low levels of iga and igg, possibly by the low amount of psaa expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. all three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of psaa protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) cfu). however, l. plantarum ncdo1193 and l. helveticus atcc15009 elicited the highest antibody response (iga and igg). vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant l. lactis led  to a decrease in s. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. our results confirm that certain lactobacillus strains have intrinsic  properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.

[piraino, p., ricciardi, a., lanorte, m. t., malkhazova, i., parente, e., 2002. a new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. biotechnol. lett. 24, 1477-1482]. hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (leuconostoc, lb. sakei/lb. curvatus, lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus, lb. plantarum/lb. paraplantarum, lc. lactis/lc. raffinolactis). a 7x7 kohonen self-organizing map (ksom), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. the map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 bayesian network  were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of sds-page patterns of  lc. lactis from those of other species. we conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of sds-page patterns of whole cell proteins.

AB  == the characteristics of cell growth, lactic acid production, amino acid release and consumption by single-strain cultures of lactic acid bacteria (isolated from  kefir grains), and by a multiple-strain kefir starter prepared from them, were studied. the change in the levels of free amino acids was followed throughout the kefir process: single-strain kefir bacteria and the kefir starter (lactococcus lactis c15-1%+lactobacillus helveticus mp12-3%+(streptococcus thermophilus t15+lactobacillus bulgaricus hp1 = 1:1)-3%) were cultivated in pasteurized (92 degrees c for 20 min) cow's milk (3% fat content) at 28 degrees c for 5 h (the kefir starter reached ph 4.7) and subsequently grown at 20 degrees c for 16 h; storage was at 4 degrees c for 168 h. the strain l. helveticus mp12 was unrivaled with respect to free amino acid production (53.38 mg (100 g)(-1)) and cell growth (17.8 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1)); however, it manifested the lowest acidification activity. l. bulgaricus hp1 released approximately 3.7 times less amino acids, nearly 5 times lower cell growth, and produced about 1.2 times more lactic acid.  s. thermophilus t15 demonstrated dramatically complex amino acid necessities for  growth and metabolism. with l. lactis c15, the highest levels of growth and lactic acid synthesis were recorded (18.3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) and 7.8 g l(-1) lactic acid at the 21st hour), and as for free amino acid production, it approximated l. bulgaricus hp1 (17.03 mg (100 g)(-1) maximum concentration). in the l. lactis c15 culture, the amino acids were used more actively throughout the first exponential growth phase (by the 10th hour) than during the second growth phase. the unique properties of the l. helveticus mp12 strain to produce amino acids were employed to create a symbiotic bioconsortium kefir culture, which, under conditions of kefir formation, enhanced lactic acid production and shortened the time required to reach ph 4.7; intensified cell growth activity, resulting in a respective 90- and 60-fold increase in the concentration of lactobacilli and cocci in the mixed culture compared to individual cultures; and  accumulated free amino acids in the final kefir with higher total concentrations  (56.88 mg (100 g)(-1)) and an individual concentration of essential amino acids (1.5 times) greater than that of yogurt.

AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == accumulation of short n-chain ethyl esters by esterases of lactic acid bacteria under conditions simulating ripening parmesan cheese.
AB  == esta from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 (lbh-esta), estb, and estc from lactobacillus casei lila, and esta from lactococcus lactis mg1363 (lcl-esta) were evaluated for their ability to accumulate esters in a model system simulating parmesan cheese ripening conditions (10 degrees c, 2 to 3% nacl, ph 5.4 to 5.5, aw = 0.850 to 0.925) using capalase k from kid goat as a positive control. all of the lab esterases and capalase k mediated the accumulation of esters in the model system in an enzyme specific manner, which was influenced by a, and selectivity for fatty acid chain-length. in general, enzyme mediated accumulation of ethyl esters was higher at aw values of 0.850 and 0.900 than at aw of 0.925, demonstrating that aw is a critical parameter influencing ester accumulation. the substrate selectivity of esterases, aw, and enzyme type may be important factors  in the development of fruity flavors, as evidenced by results in this model system simulating parmesan cheese ripening conditions.

TI  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria and aging temperature affect calcium lactate crystallization in cheddar cheese.
AB  == the occurrence of unappetizing calcium lactate crystals in cheddar cheese is a challenge and expense to manufacturers, and this research was designed to understand their origin. it was hypothesized that nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) affect calcium lactate crystallization (clc) by producing d(-)-lactate. this study was designed to understand the effect of nslab growth and aging temperature on clc. cheeses were made from milk inoculated with lactococcus lactis starter culture, with or without lactobacillus curvatus or l. helveticus wsu19 adjunct cultures. cheeses were aged at 4 or 13 degrees c for 28 d, then half of the cheeses from 4 and 13 degrees c were transferred to 13 and 4 degrees  c, respectively, for the remainder of aging. the form of lactate in cheeses without adjunct culture or with l. helveticus wsu19 was predominantly l(+)-lactate (> 95%, wt/wt), and crystals were not observed within 70 d. while initial lactate in cheeses containingl. curvatus was only l(+)-lactate, the concentration of d(-)-lactate increased during aging. after 28 d, a racemic mixture of d/l-lactate was measured in cheeses containing l. curvatus; at the same time, clc was observed. the earliest and most extensive clc occurred on cheeses aged at 13 degrees c for 28 d then transferred to 4 degrees c. these results showed that production of d(-)-lactate by nslab, and aging temperature affect clc in maturing cheddar cheese.

TI  == synthetic peptides as substrate for assaying the proteolytic activity of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == four lactobacillus helveticus strains were studied for proteolytic capacity and general aminopeptidase (ap) and x-pro dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (dap) activity. the rate of hydrolysis and the activity against synthetic substrates with n-terminal residues of arg, lys, leu, glu or pro, varied markedly among the strains. the x-pro dap activity was consistently high. the crude cell-wall and cytoplasm extracts from strain lb. helveticus islc59 were analysed thoroughly for their proteolysis ability by using four synthetic peptide substrates, including alpha(s)1-cn(f1-23). peptides formed during in vitro hydrolysis of the synthetic  substrates by cell wall and cytoplasm preparations were identified by lc-esi/ms.  in doing so, it was possible to infer a prevalent endopeptidase activity splitting lys7-his8 and gln13-glu14 bonds in the cytoplasm, and to deduce a secondary activity, which hydrolysed glu14-val15, leu16-asn17, glu18-asn19 and lys3-his4 bonds lacking in the cell-wall. the presence of exopeptidases, as mainly ap, dap, and carboxypeptidase (cpase) was deduced from the formation of several n- and c-terminally truncated peptides sets. the ap activity was higher in the cell-wall layer, where cpase activity was absent. the in vitro assays with cell extracts of the lb. helveticus islc59 strain revealed extensive exopeptidase and endopeptidase activities. in several cases, the hydrolytic system of lb. helveticus that splits in vitro alpha(s)1-cn(f1-23) peptide bonds was similar to  that of lactococcus lactis. the effects were also compared with those occurring in vivo in hard cheese such as grana padano.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria: inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == a total of 26 strains of wild-type lactic acid bacteria, mainly belonging to lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus helveticus, were assayed in vitro for their  ability to produce a milk fermentate with inhibitory activity towards angiotensin converting enzyme (ace). it was clear that the test strains in this study, in general, produce inhibitory substances in varying amounts. using a spectrophotometric assay based on amino group derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde as a measure of relative peptide content, it was shown that there is a significant correlation between peptide formation and ace inhibition, indicating that peptide measurement constitutes a convenient selection method. the effect of active fermentates on in vivo ace activity was demonstrated in normotensive rats. the pressor effect of angiotensin i (0.3 microg/kg) upon intravenous injection was significantly lower when rats were pre-fed with milks fermented using two strains of lactobacillus helveticus. an increased response to bradykinin (10 microg/kg, intravenously injected) was observed using one of these fermented milks. it is concluded that lactobacillus helveticus produces substances which in vivo can give rise to an inhibition of ace. the inhibition in vivo was low compared to what can be achieved with classical ace inhibitors. the clinical relevance of this finding is discussed. this work is the first in which an effect of fermented milk on ace in vivo has been demonstrated, measured as decreased ability to convert angiotensin i to angiotensin ii.

TI  == autolytic activity and pediocin-induced lysis in pediococcus acidilactici and pediococcus pentosaceus strains.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus, the peptidoglycan hydrolases content and the effect of pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysins on cell lysis. methods and results: the autolytic phenotype of pediococcus strains was evaluated under starvation conditions in potassium phosphate buffer. the strains tested showed an extent of autolysis ranging between 40 and 90% after 48 h of starvation at 37 degrees c. peptidoglycan hydrolase content was evaluated by renaturing sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) using cells of micrococcus lysodeikticus as a target for the enzymatic activity and a major activity band migrating at about 116 kda was detected. additional secondary lytic bands migrating in a range of molecular weight between 45 and 110 kda were also detected. the lytic activity, evaluated in the presence of different chemicals, was retained in 15 mm cacl2 and in a range of ph between 5 and 9.5 but was strongly reduced in presence of 8% nacl and in the presence of protease inhibitors. the substrate specificity of peptidoglycan hydrolases of pediococcus  strains was evaluated in renaturing sds-page incorporating cells of different bacterial species. lytic activity was detected against cells of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus  and listeria monocytogenes. the interaction between pediocin ach/pa-1 and autolysis was evaluated and a relevant effect of bacteriocin in cell-induced lysis was observed. conclusions: the autolytic phenotype is widely distributed among p. acidilactici and p. pentosaceus and the rate of autolysis is high in the majority of the analysed strains. several autolytic bands, detected by renaturing sds-page, retained their activity against several lactic acid bacteria and l. monocytogenes. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the  autolytic phenotype of pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus strains should expand the knowledge of their role in fermentation processes where these species  occur as primary or secondary bacterial population.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactobacillus helveticus pepo2, an endopeptidase with post-proline specificity.
AB  == a post-proline endopeptidase (pepo2) was detected in cell extracts from a genomic library of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 by using the synthetic substrate n-acetyl-beta-casein-(f203-209)-rho-nitroanilide in a coupled reaction with aminopeptidase n. isolates with activity for this substrate contained plasmids with visually indistinguishable restriction profiles. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,947-bp open reading frame, designated pepo2, encoding a putative 71.4-kda protein. analysis of the predicted peptide sequence revealed that l. helveticus pepo2 contained the zinc-dependent metalloprotease motif hexxh and exhibited levels of amino acid sequence similarity of 72, 61, 59, and 53% to  l. helveticus pepo, lactococcus lactis pepo2, l. lactis pepo, and lactobacillus rhamnosus pepo, respectively. northern hybridization results indicated that the transcript containing pepo2 was monocistronic. despite the high degrees of amino  acid similarity to pepo proteins from other lactic acid bacteria, the specificity of the l. helveticus pepo2 for post-proline bonds distinguishes it from other pepo-type endopeptidases characterized to date. the specificity for post-proline  bonds also suggests that this enzyme may play a central role in the hydrolysis of casein-derived bitter peptides, such as beta-casein(f193-209).

TI  == efficient mechanical disruption of lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii by a new high-pressure homogenizer and recovery of intracellular aminotransferase activity.
AB  == microbiological studies often involve bacterial cell fractionation, which is known to be difficult for gram-positive as compared to gram-negative bacteria. our purpose was to test the breaking efficiency of a new high-pressure pilot homogenizer for three gram-positive species involved in dairy technology and to assess the activity of an intracellular aminotransferase. varied pressures (50, 100 and 200 mpa) were applied to concentrated bacterial suspensions (1.2 mg dry weight/ml) of lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis and propionibacterium  freudenreichii. breaking efficiency was estimated by decreases in optical density at 650 nm, cellular dry weight and viability. the proteins released were quantified and the residual intracellular aminotransferase activity was estimated using leucine as substrate. one run at 50 mpa was sufficient to break 80% of lactobacilli cells whereas 200 mpa were required for the same efficiency for l. lactis and p. freudenreichii. whatever the pressure, leucine aminotransferase activity was recovered in the supernatant after cell breaking. this new high-pressure pilot homogenizer can allow rapid (20 s/run), easy, continuous and  highly efficient cell breaking for intracellular enzyme recovery or other purposes. as the species tested were not phylogenetically related, and had different morphologies and cell wall compositions, we conclude that most gram-positive bacteria may be broken efficiently by this new device.

TI  == food-grade host/vector expression system for lactobacillus casei based on complementation of plasmid-associated phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg.
AB  == a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus casei based on lactose selection was constructed. the wild-type non-starter host lb. casei strain e utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system. for food-grade  cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was constructed by deleting a 141-bp fragment from the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg via gene replacement. the  deletion resulted in an inactive phospho-beta-galactosidase enzyme with an internal in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. a complementation plasmid was constructed containing a replicon from lactococcus lactis, the lacg gene from lb. casei, and the constitutive promoter of pepr for lacg expression from lb. rhamnosus. the expression of the lacg gene from the resulting food-grade plasmid  pleb600 restored the ability of the lactose-negative mutant strain to grow on lactose to the wild-type level. the vector pleb600 was used for expression of the proline iminopeptidase gene pepi from lb. helveticus in lb. casei. the results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper can be used for expression of foreign genes in lb. casei.

TI  == overexpression of peptidases in lactococcus and evaluation of their release from  leaky cells.
AB  == walker and klaenhammer (2001) developed a novel expression system in lactococcus  lactis that facilitated the release of beta-galactosidase (117 kda monomer) without the need for secretion or export signals. the system is based on the controlled expression of integrated prophage holin and lysin cassettes via a lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 transcriptional activator (tac31a) that resides on a high-copy plasmid. approximately 85% of beta-galactosidase activity was detected in the supernatant of leaky lactococci without evidence of hindered growth, cell lysis, or membrane damage. the objective of this study was to determine if intracellular peptidases were externalized from leaky lactococci. five l. lactis peptidases (pepa, pepc, pepn, pepo and pepxp) and two lactobacillus helveticus peptidases (pepn and pepo) were cloned and overexpressed on two high-copy vectors. the lactococcal peptidases were also cloned into the high-copy vector that contained the tac31a transcriptional activator to determine if they were externalized from the leaky prophage-containing l. lactis subsp. lactis strain nck203. two of the lactococcal peptidases (pepa and pepo) required  an additional strong promoter (lactobacillus paracasei p144) and optimized assay  conditions to detect enzyme activity. results showed different levels of enzymatic overexpression associated with the cellular fraction (2 to 250-fold increases in activity) and negligible amounts of activity present within the supernatant fraction (0 to 6% of total peptidase activity). the lactococcal phage-based protein release mechanism did not facilitate the externalization of the lactococcal peptidases investigated in this study.

TI  == extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from streptococcus gordonii fss2.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. this is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. however, strain fss2 of s. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a ph-controlled batch culture. in this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (rap) with some cysteine class characteristics. isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of  approximately 70 kda, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. nested-pcr cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long dna fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid n terminus of rap. culture activity profiles and n-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis. we believe that rap may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during sbe pathology.

AB  == the surface chemical composition and physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity and zeta potential) of two lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetilactis and lactobacillus helveticus, have been investigated using cells harvested in exponential or stationary growth phase. the surface composition determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) was converted into a molecular composition in terms of proteins, polysaccharides, and hydrocarbonlike compounds. the concentration of the last was always below 15% (wt/wt), which is related to the hydrophilic character revealed by water contact  angles of less than 30 degrees. the surfaces of l. lactis cells had a polysaccharide concentration about twice that of proteins. the s-layer of l. helveticus was either interrupted or crossed by polysaccharide-rich compounds; the concentration of the latter was higher in the stationary growth phase than in the exponential growth phase. further progress was made in the interpretation of  xps data in terms of chemical functions by showing that the oxygen component at 531.2 ev contains a contribution of phosphate in addition to the main contribution of the peptide link. the isoelectric points were around 2 and 3, and the electrophoretic mobilities above ph 5 (ionic strength, 1 mm) were about -3.0  x 10(-8) and -0.6 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1) v(-1) for l. lactis and l. helveticus, respectively. the electrokinetic properties of the latter reveal the influence of carboxyl groups, while the difference between the two strains is related to a difference between n/p surface concentration ratios, reflecting the relative exposure of proteins and phosphate groups at the surface.

AB  == the complete 42180-bp nucleotide sequence of the mobilization plasmid pnz4000, coding for exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactococcus lactis, was determined. this plasmid contains a region involved in eps biosynthesis, four functional replicons, a region containing mobilization genes, and three origin of transfer (orit) sequences. sequences identical to these orit sequences were also  found on two other lactococcal plasmids and a plasmid from lactobacillus helveticus. several complete and partial is elements were identified on pnz4000,  including iso-iss1, iso-is946, and iso-is982 sequences. furthermore, pnz4000 contains a gene cluster that may encode a cobalt transport system and a gene that encodes a cora homologue which may function as a magnesium transporter.

TI  == purification and molecular characterization of a tripeptidase (pept) from lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == a tripeptidase (pept) from a thermophilic dairy starter strain of lactobacillus helveticus was purified by four chromatographic steps. pept appeared to be a trimeric metallopeptidase with a molecular mass of 150 kda. pept exhibited maximum activity against hydrophobic tripeptides, with the highest activity for met-gly-gly (k(m), 2.6 mm; v(max), 80.2 micromol. min(-1). microg(-1)). some of the hydrophobic dipeptides were slowly hydrolyzed, distinguishing the lactobacillus pept from its counterpart in mesophilic lactococcus lactis. no activity against tetrapeptides or amino acid p-nitroanilide derivatives was observed. the pept gene and its flanking regions were isolated by pcr and sequenced by cyclic sequencing. the sequence analyses revealed open reading frames (orfs) 816 bp (orf1) and 1,239 bp (orf2) long. orf2 encoded a 47-kda pept  protein which exhibited 53% identity with the pept from l. lactis. the mrna analyses indicated that pept conforms a novel operon structure with an orf1 located upstream. several putative -35/-10 regions preceded the operon, but only  one transcription start site located downstream of the first putative -10 region  was identified. an inverted repeat structure with deltag of -64.8 kj/mol was found downstream of the pept-encoding region.

TI  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) is part of the glnra operon in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == a peptidase gene expressing x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) activity was cloned from lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate l-glycyl-l-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb hindiii fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (orf) of 2,391 nucleotides. the 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this orf was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with pepxs from lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactococcus lactis, respectively. by northern analysis with a pepx-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepx is part of a polycistronic operon in l. rhamnosus. cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepx revealed the presence of two orfs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to glnr and glna proteins, respectively. by multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepx region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnr. northern analysis with glna- and pepx-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnr promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnr-glna transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. the glna gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using  a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glna. in the disruption mutant, glnra-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glna- or pepx-specific probe, demonstrating that pepx is indeed part of glnra operon in l. rhamnosus. reverse transcription-pcr analysis further supported this operon structure. an extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepx in the glna-pepx intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23s-5s intergenic spacer and to several other l. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.

TI  == peptidases and amino acid catabolism in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the conversion of peptides to free amino acids and their subsequent utilization is a central metabolic activity in prokaryotes. at least 16 peptidases from lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been characterized biochemically and/or genetically. among lab, the peptidase systems of lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis have been examined in greatest detail. while there are homologous enzymes common to both systems, significant differences exist in the peptidase complement of these organisms. the characterization of single and multiple peptidase mutants indicate that these strains generally exhibit reduced  specific growth rates in milk compared to the parental strains. lab can also catabolize amino acids produced by peptide hydrolysis. while the catabolism of amino acids such as arg, thr, and his is well understood, few other amino acid catabolic pathways from lactic acid bacteria have been characterized in significant detail. increasing research attention is being directed toward elucidating these pathways as well as characterizing their physiological and industrial significance.

AB  == a cassette based on the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis surface (s)-layer protein gene (slpa) was constructed. the low-copy-number vector pkth2095, derived from pgk12, was used as the cloning vector. the efficiency of slpa promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusa), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase n  (pepn) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus gasseri. the s-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially l. lactis and lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. the production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. the gusa, luc and pepn activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. the highest levels  of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in l. lactis. the level of gusa obtained in l. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. the highest level of aminopeptidase n activity was achieved in lb. plantarum where pepn corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. this level of pepn activity is 30-fold higher than that in lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepn gene originates.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

AB  == a previously identified insert expressing an endopeptidase from a lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 genomic library was characterized. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,941 bp encoding a putative protein of 71.2 kda which contained a zinc-protease motif. protein homology searches revealed that this enzyme has 40% similarity with endopeptidase o (pepo) from lactococcus  lactis p8-2-47. northern hybridization revealed that pepo is monocistronic and is expressed throughout the growth phase. cnrz32 derivatives lacking pepo activity were constructed via gene replacement. enzyme assays revealed that the pepo mutant had significantly reduced endopeptidase activity when compared to cnrz32 with two of the three substrates examined. growth studies indicated that pepo has no detectable effect on growth rate or acid production by lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 in amino acid defined or skim milk medium.

AB  == lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 892 contains a surface layer (s-layer) composed of  protein monomers of 43 kda organized in regular arrays. the gene encoding this protein (slph) has been cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. slph consists of 440 codons and is preceded by a ribosome-binding site (rbs) and followed by a  putative rho-independent terminator. indeed, northern analysis revealed that slph is a monocistronic gene. the gene is preceded by a possible promotor of which the -35 and -10 hexanucleotides are separated by 17 nt. by primer extension analysis  the transcription start site was mapped at 7 nt downstream of the -10 sequence while the deduced amino acid sequence of slph shows a leader peptide of 30 aa. the slph gene has been amplified by pcr and the fragment, carrying the complete gene from the rbs to the stop codon, has been cloned in a lactococcal gene expression vector downstream of promoter p32. lactococcus lactis mg1363 carrying  the resulting plasmid produced and secreted an s-layer monomer with the same molecular mass as the authentic l. helveticus cnrz 892 slph, as judged by sds-page. immunoelectron microscopy revealed that slph was bound to the lactococcal cell walls in small clumps and accumulated in the growth medium as small sheets.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial flora of sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == the microflora of a sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. the dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5)  cfu g-1. the spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum and lact. reuteri. the total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the ph dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. in this phase, only the latter two species remained dominant  in a ratio of 1:1. from the sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. sequence comparison of partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. five strains were classified as lact. vaginalis and could be regarded  as heterogeneous biovars of this species. the other two strains could be assigned to lact. helveticus. rapd-pcr and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.

AB  == a transferable dual-plasmid inducible gene expression system for use in lactic acid bacteria that is based on the autoregulatory properties of the antimicrobial peptide nisin produced by lactococcus lactis was developed. introduction of the two plasmids allowed nisin-inducible gene expression in lactococcus lactis mg1363, leuconostoc lactis nz6091, and lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32. typically, the beta-glucuronidase activity (used as a reporter in this study) remained below the detection limits under noninducing conditions and could be raised to high levels, by addition of subinhibitory amounts of nisin to the growth medium, while exhibiting a linear dose-response relationship. these results demonstrate that the nisin-inducible system can be functionally implemented in lactic acid bacteria other than lactococcus lactis.

AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

AB  == bacteriophages against streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the italian cheese industry. one possible control method involves replacing s. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. in this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 25744, p. pentosaceus atcc 25745, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 12697 by electroporation with ppn-1, a 35-kb lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. transformants of p. pentosaceus atcc 25745 and p. acidilactici atcc 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained ppn-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. paired starter combinations of pediococcus spp. and lactobacillus helveticus lh100 exhibited synergistic ph reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed  that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for s. thermophilus in italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat s. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.

AB  == lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 possesses an xaa-prolyldipeptidyl aminopeptidase  (pepx), which releases amino-terminal dipeptides from peptides containing proline residues in the penultimate position. the pepx gene, designated pepx, from lb. helveticus cnrz32 was sequenced. analysis of the sequence identified a putative 2379-bp pepx open-reading frame, which encodes a polypeptide of 793 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 88,111 da. the gene shows significant sequence identity with sequenced pepx genes from lactic acid bacteria. the product of the gene contains a motif that is almost identical with the active-site motif of the serine-dependent pepx from lactococci. the introduction  of pepx into lactococcus lactis lm0230 on either pgk12 (a low-copy-number plasmid vector) or pil253 (a high-copy-number plasmid vector) did not result in a significant increase in pepx activity, while the introduction of pepx into cnrz32 on pgk12 resulted in a four-fold increase in pepx activity. southern hybridization experiments revealed that the pepx gene from cnrz32 is well conserved in lactobacilli, pediococci and streptococci. the physiological role of pepx during growth in lactobacillus mrs (a rich medium containing protein hydrolysates along with other ingredients) and milk was examined by comparing growth of cnrz32 and a cnrz32 pepx-negative derivative. no difference in growth rate or acid production was observed between cnrz32 and its pepx-negative derivative in mrs. however, the cnrz32 pepx-negative derivative grew in milk at a reduced specific growth rate when compared to wild-type cnrz32. introduction of the cloned pepx determinant into the cnrz32 pepx-negative derivative resulted in  a construct with a specific growth rate similar to that of wild-type cnrz32.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis dsm7290 cysteine aminopeptidase gene pepc.
AB  == a genomic library of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis dsm7290 in the low copy number vector plg339, was screened for the presence of peptidase genes. using the chromogenic substrate gly-ala-beta-naphthylamide, which is not a substrate for any of the recently cloned peptidases of dsm7290, and the multiple  peptidase deficient escherichia coli strain cm89, allowed the isolation of clones, which contained the equivalent hydrolytic activity. to identify genes encoding the conserved catalytic active site of cysteine proteases, partial nucleotide sequencing with a degenerate oligonucleotide was performed on recombinant plasmids isolated from such clones. this allowed to identify two out  of nine clones to carry the lactobacillus pepc gene. a total of 2026 nucleotides  were determined, and sequence analysis revealed a gene with strong homology to the recently cloned lb. helveticus (73.2%) and lactococcus lactis (51.03%) pepc genes, and the derived protein showed homology with the active site of a large number of cysteine proteases. the predicted open reading frame consists of 449 codons, coding for a protein of 50,909 da. the enzyme is functional and extremely overexpressed in e. coli.

TI  == characterization and expression of the lactobacillus helveticus pepc gene encoding a general aminopeptidase.
AB  == an aminopeptidase c gene (pepc) was detected by nucleic acid hybridization from an industrially important lactobacillus helveticus strain. three hybridization positive clones were isolated from a gene library of this l. helveticus strain, and one of them was characterized in more detail. deletion mapping localized the  hybridization positivity into a 2.8-kb fragment, which also encoded aminopeptidase activity. this fragment was sequenced and two open reading frames  (orf1 and 2) of 1347 and 840 base pairs were identified. the orf1 was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region, and an inverted repeat structure with delta g of -49.0 kj mol-1 was found downstream of the coding region. the deduced  amino acid sequence of orf1, with an encoding capacity for a 51.4-kda protein, was shown to share 48.3% and 98.0% identities with the pepc proteins from lactococcus lactis and l. helveticus cnrz32, respectively, thus confirming that orf1 codes for an aminopeptidase c. mrna size analyses revealed 1.7-kb and 2.7-kb transcripts in northern blot with the pepc-specific probe. a further analysis with the pepc- and orf2-specific probes showed that downstream orf2 is co-transcribed with the pepc gene at the exponential phase of growth whereas, at  the stationary growth phase, transcripts derived from the pepc promoter were below the detection limit, and the orf2 was expressed by its own promoter. the 5' end mapping of the pepc transcripts with primer extension revealed one transcription start site suggesting a new position for the pepc promoter region when compared to that predicted for the l. helveticus cnrz32 pepc gene. expression of pepc was also studied in l. helveticus as the function of growth in a bioreactor study. transcription of pepc was typical to exponential growth phase expression. the level of total thiol-aminopeptidase activity, however, remained nearly constant throughout the stationary growth phase.

TI  == characterization of the lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 pepc gene.
AB  == sequence analysis of the aminopeptidase c gene (pepc) from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 identified a 1,332-nucleotide open reading frame coding for a polypeptide with motifs characteristic of cysteine proteinases. homology to the pepc gene appears to be widely distributed among lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == partial characterization of an rpod-like gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  == with degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal dna fragment of an rpod-like gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the dna sequence of this pcr product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed  an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "rpod box" of primary sigma factors. this pcr product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. these data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == isolation and characterization of is1165, an insertion sequence of leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris and other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == we have cloned and characterized an insertion sequence from leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strain db1165. this element, designated is1165, is  1553 bp, has imperfect inverted repeat ends, contains an open reading frame of 1236 bp, and is not related to any previously described insertion sequence. the copy number of is1165 varies from 4 to 13 in l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris strains allowing genetic fingerprinting of strains based on location and number of bands on hybridization. is1165 or closely related elements have been detected  by hybridization in l. lactis, l. oenos, pediococcus sp., lactobacillus helveticus, and lb. casei but not in lactococcus.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid pip501 from lactococcus lactis to lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == plasmid pip501 was transferred by conjugation from lactococcus lactis to lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus helveticus. only lb. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus transconjugants could act as a donor in crosses with lc. lactis. no lactobacillus transconjugants were detected after inter- or intra-species lactobacillus crosses. plasmid pip501 has undergone no detectable deletion or rearrangement during transfer from lc. lactis to lactobacillus strains.

TI  == evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pip501 into strains of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == the conjugative broad host range plasmid pip501 was transferred from streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. with these transconjugants as donors the  plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of strep. thermophilus. there was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of lact. helveticus. transfer from lact. helveticus to strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. there was no evidence for the conjugal transfer  of plasmid pip501 into a strain of lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either  lactic streptococci or lactobacillus sp.

TI  == lactostrepcins--acid bacteriocins produced by lactic streptococci.
AB  == all 47 non-nisin producing strains of streptococcus lactis and 12/13 strains of str. lactis subsp. diacetylactis examined produced bacteriocins, for which the term lactostrepcins is suggested. seven strains of str. cremoris examined produced no bacteriocins active against 3 lactic streptococci strains used as indicators. the strains examined were divided into 3 groups: i, those producing lactostrepcins active against only one streptomycin resistant mutant of str. lactis 60 indicator strain; ii, those producing lactostrepcins active against all 3 indicator strains; iii, those not producing lactostrepcins active against the indicator strains employed. the lactostrepcins were sensitive to various proteolytic enzymes and to phospholipase d, but retained full or partial activity after dialysis. most of the bacteriocins studied were fully active only within the ph range 4.2--5.0 and were reversibly inactivated at ph 7.0 or 8.0. results suggested occurrence of 4 different lactostrepcins. the lactostrepcins produced by all group i strains were the same, but there were differences among the lactostrepcins produced by group ii strains. lactostrepcins killed some beta-haemolytic streptococci and some strains of lactobacillus helveticus. one of the lactostrepcins was also active against certain leuconostoc strains, but not against other leuconostoc strains, nor against l. helveticus or other gram-positive bacteria.
