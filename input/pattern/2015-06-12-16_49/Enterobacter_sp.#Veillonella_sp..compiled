TI  - Analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  - Calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in Astragali Radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. However, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, five strains including Bacteroides sp.13, and sp.58, Clostridium sp.21-2, Veillonella sp.43-1, and Bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to convert calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. A total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. On the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium were less severely affected. This indicates that calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.
TI  - Effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  - Licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional Chimese medicines. However, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, six strains, comprising Bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, Veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, Bacillus sp. 46 and Clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. A total of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. The results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin. On the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an Emax precision microplate reader. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was less severely affected. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.
TI  - Intestinal mucosa-associated microflora in ulcerative colitis patients before and after restorative proctocolectomy with an ileoanal pouch.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify the mucosa-associated microflora in  patients with severe ulcerative colitis before and after restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch construction in comparison with historic controls. METHODS: Ten patients with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis were evaluated. Mucus was collected during colonoscopy from all segments of the colon and terminal ileum before surgery, and from the ileal pouch two and eight months after ileostomy closure. The prevalence and mean concentration of the mucosa-associated microflora were compared over time and with historic controls. RESULTS: Veillonella sp was the most prevalent bacterium in patients and controls. Klebsiella sp was significantly more prevalent in the ileum of controls, was not found in patients with ulcerative colitis, and after proctocolectomy returned to values found in controls. Some bacteria such as Enterobacter sp, Staphylococcus sp (coag-), Bacteroides sp (npg), Lactobacillus sp, and Veillonella sp had higher mean concentrations in the ileal pouch of patients after surgery than in controls. CONCLUSION: No bacterium was identified that could be exclusively responsible for the maintenance of the inflammatory process. The mucosa-associated microflora of patients with ulcerative colitis underwent significant changes after proctocolectomy with ileal pouch construction and returned to almost normal values for some bacteria.
TI  - A novel sampling method for the investigation of gut mirobiota.
AB  - AIM: In order to characterize the qualitative and quantitative microorganisms in  different sites of the lower digestive tract (LDT) in healthy volunteers, a specific technique was developed for collecting mucous of the distal ileum, colon and rectum. METHODS: A polyethylene tube was designed to go through the colonoscope channel with a No.8 French tube. In order to avoid internal contamination, the distal extremity was protected with a membrane of microfilm after being sterilized in ethilene oxid. To facilitate the aspiration of a precise volume, its interior was coated with silicone. One hundred microlliter (0.1 mL) sample of mucous was collected and transferred into an Eppenddorff tube containing nine hundred microlliter (0.9 mL) of VMGA-3 (viable medium of Goteborg). This procedure was repeated at each site of the LDT with a new sterilized catheter. RESULTS: All sites revealed the "non pathogenic" anaerobic bacteria Veillonella sp (average 10(5) colony forming units/mL-CFU/mL), allowing to conclude an environment of low oxidation-reduction potential (redox) in the LDT. It was also characterized the presence of Klebisiella sp with significant statistical predominance (SSP) in the ileum. Enterobacter sp was found with SSP in the sigmoid colon, Bacteroides sp non-pigmented (npg) and E.coli with SSP in the sigmoid colon and rectum, Enterococcus sp and Lactobacillus sp with SSP in the rectum, all in a mean concentration of 10(5) CFU/mL. CONCLUSION: This procedure is feasible and efficient and can point out a similar distribution of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with the presence of biological markers of normal microbiota in the LDT.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
