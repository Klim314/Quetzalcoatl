enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibits biofilm formation by oral cariogenic streptococci.
this study investigated the inhibitory effect of probiotic enterococcus faecium wb2000 on biofilm formation by cariogenic streptococci. the ability of e. faecium wb2000 and jcm5804 and enterococcus faecalis jcm5803 to inhibit biofilm formation by seven laboratory oral streptococcal strains and 13 clinical mutans streptococcal strains was assayed. the enterococcal strains inhibited biofilm formation in dual cultures with the mutans streptococcal strains streptococcus mutans xc and streptococcus sobrinus jcm5176 (p < 0.05), but not with the noncariogenic streptococcal strains. enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibited biofilm formation by 90.0% (9/10) of the clinical s. mutans strains and 100% (3/3) of the clinical s. sobrinus strains. after culturing, the ph did not differ between single and dual cultures. the viable counts of floating mutans streptococci were lower in dual cultures with e. faecium wb2000 than in single cultures. enterococcus faecium wb2000 acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of cariogenic streptococcal biofilm formation.
inhibiting effects of enterococcus faecium non-biofilm strain on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
background and purpose: enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. this study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of e. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. methods: the effects of e. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. results: the e. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical s. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. the inhibiting effects of e. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and e. faecium, low ph after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of s. mutans. a culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kda from e. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward s. mutans biofilm formation. treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of s. mutans with the sample. moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of e. faecium to s. mutans strains. conclusions: the e. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.
different bacteriocin activities of streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. in this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains from new zealand, north america and europe were classified into four groups (a-d) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or indicator strains staphylococcus aureus 46 and enterococcus faecium te1. two of the strains included in the study (ua140 and ua96) were representatives of the group i and ii mutacin producer strains previously described by caufield and co-workers. one of the new zealand isolates of group a (s. mutans strain n) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group i prototype strain ua140. four other new zealand isolates of group b (s. mutans strains m19, m34, b34 and d14) had mutacin ii-like activity. the group b mutacin producers differed from the group a mutacin producers in their additional activity against staph. aureus 46. seven s. mutans strains (m46, b46, b57, m12, m28, b28 and 13m) were distinguished from the group a and group b mutacin producers in that they inhibited e. faecium te1. these were called group c mutacin producers. strains h7 and h23 resembled the group c strains in their action on both indicator strains te1 and 46. however, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group d mutacin producers. phylogenetic analysis of the strains by several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of s. mutans.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
