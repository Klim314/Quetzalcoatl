TI  == growth ability of gram negative bacteria in free-living amoebae.
AB  == when bacteria and free-living amoebae (flas) live both in natural waters and man-made aquatic systems, they constantly interact with each other. some bacteria can survive and grow within flas. therefore, it has recently been thought that flas play an important role in spreading pathogenic bacteria in aquatic systems.  in this study we investigated the intracellular growing ability of 7 different gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, pasteurella  pneumotropica, aeromonas salmonicida, legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, l. pneumophila serogroup 3, l. pneumophila serogroup 6) in four different fla isolates (a1-a4). among these, four bacterial isolates (p. fluorescens, p.putida, p.pneumotropica, a.salmonicida) and two free-living amoebae isolates (a3, a4) were isolated from the tap water in our city (istanbul). it was found that 4 different gram-negative bacteria could grow in a1, 2 different gram-negative bacteria could grow in a2, 4 different gram-negative bacteria could grow in a3, 1 gram-negative bacterium could grow in a4. in conclusion, we think that this ability of growth could vary according to the characteristics of both bacteria and fla isolates. also, other factors such as environmental temperature, bacterial concentration, and extended incubation period may play a role in these  interactions. this situation can be clarified with future studies.

TI  == broad diversity of conjugative plasmids in integron-carrying bacteria from wastewater environments.
AB  == in this study we assessed the occurrence, diversity and conjugative potential of  plasmids in integron-carrying aeromonas and enterobacteriaceae from wastewaters.  sixty-six strains were included as donors in mating assays using rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida recipient strains. the diversity of plasmids from donors and transconjugants (resistant to tetracycline or streptomycin) was evaluated by restriction analysis and replicon  typing targeting 19 incompatibility groups. restriction patterns revealed a diverse plasmid pool present in these strains. plasmids were assigned to frepb (aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli, enterobacter sp.), fic (a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp.), fia (shigella sp.), i1 (a. veronii, aeromonas sp., e. coli), hi1 (e. coli) and u (aeromonas media) replicons. nevertheless, 50% of the plasmids could not be assigned to any replicon type. among integron-positive transconjugants, frepb, i1 and hi1 replicons were detected. results showed that wastewaters enclose a rich plasmid pool associated  with integron-carrying bacteria, capable of conjugating to different bacterial hosts. moreover, replicons detected in this study in aeromonas strains expand our current knowledge of plasmid diversity in this genus.

TI  == the occurrence of aeromonas in drinking water, tap water and the porsuk river.
AB  == the occurrence of aeromonas spp. in the porsuk river, public drinking water and tap water in the city of eskisehir (turkey) was monitored. fresh water samples were collected from several sampling sites during a period of one year. total 102 typical colonies of aeromonas spp. were submitted to biochemical tests for species differentiation and of 60 isolates were confirmed by biochemical tests. further identifications of isolates were carried out first with the vitek system  (biome rieux) and then selected isolates from different phenotypes (vitek types)  were identified using the dupont qualicon riboprinter(r) system. aeromonas spp. was detected only in the samples from the porsuk river. according to the results  obtained with the vitek system, our isolates were 13% aeromonas hydrophila, 37% aeromonas caviae, 35% pseudomonas putida, and 15% pseudomonas acidovorans. in addition pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas maltophila, aeromonas salmonicida, aeromonas hydrophila, and aeromonas media species were determined using the riboprinter(r) system. the samples taken from the porsuk river were found to contain very diverse aeromonas populations that can pose a risk for the residents of the city. on the other hand, drinking water and tap water of the city are free from aeromonas pathogens and seem to be reliable water sources for the community.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
