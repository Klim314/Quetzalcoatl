TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == ethenoguanines undergo glycosylation by nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferases at non-natural sites.
AB  == deoxyribosyl transferases and functionally related purine nucleoside phosphorylases are used extensively for synthesis of non-natural deoxynucleosides as pharmaceuticals or standards for characterizing and quantitating dna adducts.  hence exploring the conformational tolerance of the active sites of these enzymes is of considerable practical interest. we have determined the crystal structure at 2.1 a resolution of lactobacillus helveticus purine deoxyribosyl transferase (pdt) with the tricyclic purine 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine (n2,3-ethenoguanine) at the active site. the active site electron density map was compatible with four orientations, two consistent with sites for deoxyribosylation and two appearing to be unproductive. in accord with the crystal structure, lactobacillus helveticus pdt glycosylates the 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine at n7 and n1, with a marked preference for  n7. the activity of lactobacillus helveticus pdt was compared with that of the nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferase enzymes (drt type ii) from lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus fermentum, which were somewhat more effective in the deoxyribosylation than lactobacillus helveticus pdt, glycosylating the substrate with product profiles dependent on the ph of the incubation. the purine nucleoside phosphorylase of escherichia coli, also commonly used in ribosylation  of non-natural bases, was an order of magnitude less efficient than the transferase enzymes. modeling based on published active-site structures as templates suggests that in all cases, an active site phe is critical in orienting the molecular plane of the purine derivative. adventitious hydrogen bonding with  additional active site residues appears to result in presentation of multiple nucleophilic sites on the periphery of the acceptor base for ribosylation to give a distribution of nucleosides. chemical glycosylation of o9-benzylated 8,9-dihydro-9-oxoimidazo[2,1-b]purine also resulted in n7 and n1 ribosylation. absent from the enzymatic and chemical glycosylations is the natural pattern of n3 ribosylation, verified by comparison of spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with an authentic standard synthesized by an unambiguous route.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == the effect of a multi-strain probiotic on the resistance toward escherichia coli  challenge in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study.
AB  == background: several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease. it is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components, by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system. objective: a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males, to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11, bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii cncm i-1079) on enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. primary outcomes studied were fecal etec excretion and total fecal output per day. subjects/methods: subjects were randomized to the probiotic (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfus); twice daily;  n=30) or placebo group (twice daily; n=30). after 2 weeks, subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated etec (3 x 10(9) cfu), previously demonstrated to induce mild, short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection. before and after etec challenge, subjects collected 24 h fecal samples. compliance to study guidelines, stool consistency (bristol stool score), stool frequency, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (gi) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a daily record questionnaire. results: etec challenge induced a significant increase in fecal etec excretion in both groups. however, a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group. etec challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight, and an increase in reported bristol stool score, stool frequency and  gi complaints. dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight. in addition, etec increased c-reactive protein, total secretory immunoglobulin a (iga) and immunoglobulin g colonization factor antigen ii. conclusion: dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated etec challenge in human subjects.

TI  == characterization of surface layer proteins and its role in probiotic properties of three lactobacillus strains.
AB  == the objective of this study was the characterization of the surface layer proteins (slps) and their functional role in the probiotic activity of lactobacillus helveticus fb213, l. acidophilus fb116 and l. acidophilus fb214. slps were extracted and identified by sds-page, circular dichroism spectra and lc-ms analysis. the results revealed that the molecular masses of the three proteins were 49.7 kda, 46.0 kda and 44.6 kda, respectively. the secondary structures and amino acid compositions of the three proteins were found to be similar. after removing slps, the survival of the three lactobacilli in simulated gastric and intestinal juices was reduced by 2-3log as compared with survival of  the intact cells. and the adhesion ability of the three strains to ht-29 cells decreased by 61%, 65% and 92%, respectively. slps also inhibited the adhesion and invasion of escherichia coli atcc 43893 to ht-29 cells. these results suggest that slps are advantageous barriers for lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tract, and these proteins help make it possible for lactobacilli to serve their probiotic functions.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-specific antibodies for detection of s-layer protein in grana padano protected-designation-of-origin cheese.
AB  == single-chain variable-fragment antibodies (scfvs) have considerable potential in  immunological detection and localization of bacterial surface structures. in this study, synthetic phage-displayed antibody libraries were used to select scfvs against immunologically active s-layer protein of lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5. after three rounds of panning, five relevant phage clones were obtained,  of which four were specific for the s-layer protein of l. helveticus mimlh5 and one was also capable of binding to the s-layer protein of l. helveticus atcc 15009. all five anti-s-layer scfvs were expressed in escherichia coli xl1-blue, and their specificity profiles were characterized by western blotting. the anti-s-layer scfv polyh4, with the highest specificity for the s-layer protein of l. helveticus mimlh5, was used to detect the s-layer protein in grana padano protected-designation-of-origin (pdo) cheese extracts by western blotting. these  results showed promising applications of this monoclonal antibody for the detection of immunomodulatory s-layer protein in dairy (and dairy-based) foods.

TI  == a novel branched chain amino acids responsive transcriptional regulator, bcarr, negatively acts on the proteolytic system in lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == transcriptional negative regulation of the proteolytic system of lactobacillus helveticus cm4 in response to amino acids seems to be very important for the control of antihypertensive peptide production; however, it remains poorly understood. a 26-kda protein with n-terminal cystathionine beta-synthase domains  (cbs domain protein), which seems to be involved in the regulatory system, was purified by using a dna-sepharose bound 300-bp dna fragment corresponding to the  upstream regions of the six proteolytic genes that are down-regulated by amino acids. the cbs domain protein bound to a dna fragment corresponding to the region upstream of the pepv gene in response to branched chain amino acids (bcaas). the  expression of the pepv gene in escherichia coli grown in bcaa-enriched medium was repressed when the cbs domain protein was co-expressed. these results reveal that the cbs domain protein acts as a novel type of bcaa-responsive transcriptional regulator (bcarr) in l. helveticus. from comparative analysis of the promoter regions of the six proteolysis genes, a palindromic at-rich motif, 5'-aaaaannctwttatt-3', was predicted as the consensus dna motif for the bcarr protein binding. footprint analysis using the pepv promotor region and gel shift  analyses with the corresponding short dna fragments strongly suggested that the bcarr protein binds adjacent to the pepv promoter region and affects the transcription level of the pepv gene in the presence of bcaas. homology search analysis of the c-terminal region of the bcarr protein suggested the existence of a unique betaalphabetabetaalphabeta fold structure that has been reported in a variety of act (aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyra) domain proteins for sensing amino acids. these results also suggest that the sensing of bcaas by the  act domain might promote the binding of the bcarr to dna sequences upstream of proteolysis genes, which affects the gene expression of the proteolytic system in l. helveticus.

TI  == [system analysis of the relationship between the metabolism of vitamins by micro-biota and the survival of the positive microflora of the digestive tract].
AB  == a perspective direction of the treatment of dysbacteriosis is the use of so-called metabolic prebiotics--products of metabolism of positive flora (for example, water substrate of the products of metabolism of e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, l. helveticus (strains of dsm), out of which, as known, drug hylak forte is made. our earlier systematic analysis of metabolomics, representatives of positive microflora, pointed to the fact that the latter contain specific biochemical mechanisms for biosynthesis and processing of a number of vitamins. in the present paper the results of a systematic analysis of  the effects of vitamins b2, b6 and k on the survival of the representatives of the positive microflora on the basis of the substrate of metabolic products of positive flora have been presented. the results of the analysis allow us clarify  the molecular mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of this drug with a very complex structure and confirm the available clinical data and are an important foundation for subsequent microbiological research. metabolites in the preparation composition contribute to the normalization of metabolism of pyridoxalphosphate (vitamin b6), flavin adenin dinucleotide (fad, a derivative of vitamin b2) and nicotinamide dinucleotide (nad, a derivative of vitamin b3)--cofactors of enzymes that have a significant impact on the survival of microbiota. the proposed molecular mechanisms also indicate on a possible synergies between certain vitamins and micro elements, on the one hand, and molecular components of the preparations on the basis of waste products of microbiota on the other.

TI  == characterization of the recombinant exopeptidases pepx and pepn from lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046 important for food protein hydrolysis.
AB  == the proline-specific x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx; ec 3.4.14.11) and  the general aminopeptidase n (pepn; ec 3.4.11.2) from lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046 were produced recombinantly in e. coli bl21(de3) via bioreactor cultivation. the maximum enzymatic activity obtained for pepx was 800 microkat(h-ala-pro-pna) l(-1), which is approx. 195-fold higher than values published previously. to the best of our knowledge, pepn was expressed in e. coli at high levels for the first time. the pepn activity reached 1,000 microkat(h-ala-pna) l(-1). after an automated chromatographic purification, both  peptidases were biochemically and kinetically characterized in detail. substrate  inhibition of pepn and product inhibition of both pepx and pepn were discovered for the first time. an apo-enzyme of the zn(2+)-dependent pepn was generated, which could be reactivated by several metal ions in the order of co(2+)>zn(2+)>mn(2+)>ca(2+)>mg(2+). pepx and pepn exhibited a clear synergistic effect in casein hydrolysis studies. here, the relative degree of hydrolysis (rdh) was increased by approx. 132%. due to the remarkable temperature stability  at 50 degrees c and the complementary substrate specificities of both peptidases, a future application in food protein hydrolysis might be possible.

TI  == immune signalling responses in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to pathogenic  escherichia coli and lactic acid-producing probiotics.
AB  == enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 and adherent-invasive escherichia coli are two groups of enteric bacterial pathogens associated with haemorrhagic colitis and crohn's disease, respectively. bacterial contact with host epithelial cells stimulates an immediate innate immune response designed to combat infection. in this study, immune responses of human epithelial cells to pathogens, either alone or in combination with probiotic bacteria were studied. industrially prepared lactobacillus helveticus strain r0052 was first examined by microarray analysis and then compared to broth-grown strains of r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using quantitative realt-time polymerase chain  reaction. results showed host immune activation responses increased following pathogen exposure, which were differentially ameliorated using probiotics depending on both the preparation of probiotics employed and conditions of exposure. these findings provide additional support for the concept that specific probiotic strains serve as a promising option for use in preventing the risk of enteric bacterial infections.

TI  == bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of lactobacillus strains for selected probiotic properties.
AB  == eleven strains of lactobacillus collected in the culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm) were evaluated for selected probiotic properties such as survival in gastrointestinal fluids, antimicrobial activity, and competition with non-toxigenic escherichia coli o157:h7 for adhesion on caco-2 cells. the viable count of lactobacilli was reduced during 3-h incubation in gastric fluid followed by 3-h incubation in intestinal fluid. all strains showed antimicrobial activity  and the three most effective strains inhibited the growth of at least 16 indicator strains. antimicrobial metabolites of seven strains active against lactobacillus and clostridium indicator strains were found to be sensitive to proteinase k and trypsin, which indicates their proteinaceous nature. the degree  of competitive inhibition of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhesion on the surface of caco-2 cells was strain-dependent. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the number of non-toxigenic e. coli o157:h7 adhering to caco-2 cells was observed with all lactobacilli. three strains were selected for additional studies of antimicrobial activity, i.e., lactobacillus gasseri ccdm 215, lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 149, and lactobacillus helveticus ccdm 82.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == creation of bioorthogonal redox systems depending on nicotinamide flucytosine dinucleotide.
AB  == many enzymes catalyzing biological redox chemistry depend on the omnipresent cofactor, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad). nad is also involved in various nonredox processes. it remains challenging to disconnect one particular nad-dependent reaction from all others. here we present a bioorthogonal system that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of l-malate with a dedicated abiotic cofactor, nicotinamide flucytosine dinucleotide (nfcd). by screening the multisite saturated mutagenesis libraries of the nad-dependent malic enzyme (me), we identified the mutant me-l310r/q401c, which showed excellent activity with nfcd, yet marginal activity with nad. we found that another synthetic cofactor, nicotinamide cytosine dinucleotide (ncd), also displayed similar activity with the me mutants. inspired by these observations, we mutated d-lactate dehydrogenase (dldh) and malate dehydrogenase (mdh) to dldh-v152r and mdh-l6r, respectively, and both mutants showed fully active with nfcd. when coupled with dldh-v152r, me-l310r/q401c required only a catalytic amount of nfcd to convert l-malate. our results opened the window to engineer bioorthogonal redox systems for a wide variety of applications in systems biology and synthetic biology.

TI  == immunomodulatory impact of a synbiotic in t(h)1 and t(h)2 models of infection.
AB  == background and methods: the immunomodulatory activity of a synbiotic combination  containing three bacterial strains (lactobacillus helveticus r0052, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis r0033 and bifidobacterium bifidum r0071) and short-chain fructooligosaccharide was examined in two distinct infectious rat models. in the t(h)1 model, wistar rats were administered the synbiotic combination for 2 weeks prior to challenge with a single oral dose of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli or vehicle. in the t(h)2 model, pretreated rats  were challenged with a single subcutaneous dose of hook worm, nippostrongylus brasiliensis. blood samples were collected 3 hours or 4 days postchallenge and serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured. results: significant reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-1beta, il-6, and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha were observed in both models suggesting a single, unifying mode of action on an upstream regulator. the n. brasiliensis study also compared the effect of the individual strains to synbiotic. for most of cytokines the combination appeared to average the effect of the individual strains with the exception of il-4 and il-10 where there was apparent synergy for the combination. furthermore, the cytokine response varied by strain. conclusions: it was concluded that this synbiotic combination of these three microbes could be beneficial in both t(h)1 and t(h)2 diseases.

TI  == effect of size, quaternary structure and translational error on the static and dynamic heterogeneity of beta-galactosidase and measurement of electrophoretic dynamic heterogeneity.
AB  == single enzyme molecule assays were performed using capillary electrophoresis-based protocols on beta-galactosidase from lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus helveticus and bacillus circulans. the enzyme was found to show static heterogeneity with respect to catalytic rate and the variance in rate increased with protein size. this is consistent with the proposal that random errors in translation may be an important underlying component of enzyme heterogeneity. additionally these enzymes were found to show static heterogeneity with respect to electrophoretic mobility. comparison of wild-type and rpsl e. coli beta-galactosidase expressed in the presence and absence of streptomycin suggested that increases in error do  not result in detectable increases in the dynamic heterogeneity of activity with  increasing temperature. finally, a method was developed to measure the dynamic heterogeneity in electrophoretic mobility.

TI  == chemiluminescence of non-differentiated thp-1 promonocytes: developing an assay for screening anti-inflammatory milk proteins and peptides.
AB  == human leukemic thp-1 promonocytes are widely used as a model for peripheral blood monocytes. however, superoxide production during respiratory burst (rb) of non-differentiated thp-1 (nd-thp-1) cells is very low. here we present a rapid and low-cost method for measuring the chemiluminescence (cl) of opsonized zymosan (oz) induced rb which allows detection of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced priming of nd-thp-1 cells on the basis of cl reaction kinetics. maximum cl intensity obtained was 2.20 +/- 0.25 and 1.30 +/- 0.11 relative light  units, while cl peak time was achieved at 18.1 +/- 2.6 and 28.7 +/- 1.3 min in primed and non-primed cells, respectively. the priming of nd-thp-1 cells with lps evoked typical tnf-alpha and il-6 production. we tested the effects of bovine lactoferrin and protein fractions from lactobacillus helveticus bgra43 fermented  milk for potential anti-inflammatory effects on lps primed nd-thp-1 cells. four fractions were found to inhibit the oz-induced cl in a dose-dependent manner (ic(50) 3-30 microg/ml), while lactoferrin inhibited cl to a lesser extent (ic(50) 270 microg/ml). these results suggest that measuring cl response of nd-thp-1 cells can serve as a method for screening anti-inflammatory compounds which could be used in reducing the risk of phagocyte-mediated inflammatory diseases.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  == the trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. the genome database of lactobacillus casei atcc 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. however, several l. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. by applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of l. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of l. casei atcc  334. the presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. moreover, two gene variants were identified. both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity  in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.

AB  == in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to  their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting  that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity  to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.

TI  == probiotics prevent enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7-mediated inhibition of interferon-gamma-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of stat-1.
AB  == enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7 inhibits interferon (ifn)-gamma-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat)-1 in epithelial cells. we determined the effects of probiotics on ehec-mediated disruption of ifn-gamma-stimulated stat-1  activation in epithelial cell lines. confluent intestine 407, hep-2 and caco-2 epithelial cells were pre-treated (3 h) with either probiotics or surface-layer proteins derived from lactobacillus helveticus r0052 prior to infection with ehec o157:h7 strain cl56 (m.o.i. 100:1, 6 h, 37 degrees c in 5% co2). subsequently, cells were washed and stimulated with human recombinant ifn-gamma (50 ng ml(-1),  0.5 h, 37 degrees c) followed by whole-cell protein extraction and immunoblotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated stat-1. relative to uninfected cells, stat-1-activation was reduced after ehec o157:h7 infection. pre-incubation with the probiotic l. helveticus r0052 followed by ehec infection abrogated pathogen-mediated disruption of ifn-gamma-stat-1 signalling. as determined using  transwell inserts, probiotic-mediated protection was independent of epithelial cell contact. in contrast, pre-incubation with boiled l. helveticus r0052, an equal concentration of viable lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011, or surface-layer proteins (0.14 mg ml(-1)) did not restore stat-1 signalling in ehec-infected cells. the viable probiotic agent l. helveticus r0052 prevented ehec o157:h7-mediated subversion of epithelial cell signal transduction responses.

TI  == characterization of n-deoxyribosyltransferase from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == a nucleoside n-deoxyribosyltransferase-homologous gene was detected by homological search in the genomic dna of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the gene yejd is composed of 477 nucleotides encoding 159 amino acids with only 25% identity, which is low in comparison to the amino acid sequences of the n-deoxyribosyltransferases from other lactic acid bacteria, i.e. lactobacillus leichmannii and lactobacillus helveticus. the residues responsible for catalytic  and substrate-binding sites in known enzymes are conserved at gln49, asp73, asp93 (or asp95), and glu101, respectively. the recombinant yejd expressed in escherichia coli shows a 2-deoxyribosyl transfer activity to and from both bases  of purine and pyrimidine, showing that yejd should be categorized as a class ii n-deoxyribosyltransferase. interestingly, the base-exchange activity as well as the heat stability of yejd was enhanced by the presence of monovalent cations such as k(+), nh(4)(+), and rb(+), indicating that the lactococcus enzyme is a k(+)-activated type ii enzyme. however, divalent cations including mg(2+) and ca(2+) significantly inhibit the activity. whether or not the yejd gene product actually participates in the nucleoside salvage pathway of lc. lactis remains unclear, but the lactic acid bacterium possesses the gene coding for the nucleoside n-deoxyribosyltransferase activated by k(+) on its genome.

TI  == production of active angiotensin-i converting enzyme inhibitory peptides derived  from bovine beta-casein by recombinant dna technologies.
AB  == a wide range of anti-hypertensive peptides potentially able to lower blood pressure through the inhibition of vasoactive enzymes such as angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) are known. currently, ace-inhibitory peptides can be produced from precursor proteins via enzymatic hydrolysis by proteolytic enzymes, or food fermentation with proteolytic starter cultures. these approaches are neither selective nor easy. in this study a novel procedure has been developed, based on recombinant dna technologies, for the production of highly purified fractions of three polypeptides derived from bovine beta-casein active as ace inhibitors in vitro. the procedure includes peptide expression in escherichia coli cells as recombinant fusion proteins, purification by affinity chromatography, cleavage by proteinase from a selected strain of lactobacillus helveticus and isolation of bioactive peptides (bps). the reported concentration  of inhibitor needed to reduce at 50% ace activity (ic(50)) values for single bp calculated in inhibiting the ace enzyme gave results in agreement with the same parameters available in literature for other milk-derived bps. this procedure could be used to obtain quantities of pure peptides to determine their interactions with ace, with the aim of designing peptides that have stronger inhibitory properties and exhibit new pharmacological profiles. moreover, its scale up would be of commercial interest for the production of functional foods,  e.g., milk beverages with blood pressure-lowering effects.

TI  == surface-layer protein extracts from lactobacillus helveticus inhibit enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 adhesion to epithelial cells.
AB  == adherence of intestinal pathogens, including escherichia coli o157:h7, to human intestinal epithelial cells is a key step in pathogenesis. probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus helveticus r0052 inhibit the adhesion of e. coli o157:h7  to epithelial cells, a process which may be related to specific components of the bacterial surface. surface-layer proteins (slps) are located in a paracrystalline layer outside the bacterial cell wall and are thought to play a role in tissue adherence. however, the ability of s-layer protein extract derived from probiotic bacteria to block adherence of enteric pathogens has not been investigated. human epithelial (hep-2 and t84) cells were treated with s-layer protein extract alone, infected with e. coli o157:h7, or pretreated with s-layer protein extract prior to infection to determine their importance in the inhibition of pathogen adherence. the effects of s-layer protein extracts were characterized by phase-contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance of polarized monolayers. pre-treatment of host epithelial cells with s-layer protein extracts prior to e. coli o157:h7 infection decreased pathogen adherence and attaching-effacing lesions in addition to preserving the barrier function of monolayers. these in vitro studies indicate that a non-viable constituent derived from a probiotic strain may prove effective in interrupting the infectious process of an intestinal pathogen.

AB  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (x-pdap) from lactobacillus helveticus if03809 expressed nearly full activity under high salt conditions, such as 2 m nacl. we cloned and sequenced the pepx gene for x-pdap. the calculated m, of deduced x-pdap (803 amino acids) was 90,847 and the protein was distantly related (35 to  44% identity) to known x-pdaps of lactobacillus sp. including l. helveticus cnrz32 (40% identity). native and recombinant x-pdap were purified to homogeneity from both l. helveticus if03809 and escherichia coli dh5alpha harboring the pepx  gene on a plasmid, respectively. the native enzyme appeared to be a dimer of 220  kda, as estimated by gel filtration column chromatography. it hydrolyzed an x-prolyl-linkage, but not prolyl- or x-prolyl-x-peptide bonds, and tolerated up to 2 m nacl as well as some other chlorides of monovalent cations. determination  of the flanking sequences revealed two divergent genes. the upstream region of the pepx gene encodes oppa gene for a putative oligopeptide permease, while the downstream region encodes tnp gene specifying a possible transposase of the is3 family. the oppa gene shares a 176 bp-promoter region with pepx in the intergenic region, implying a relationship between this oligopeptide transport system and x-pdap.

TI  == role of intestinal epithelial cells in immune effects mediated by gram-positive probiotic bacteria: involvement of toll-like receptors.
AB  == the mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria exert their effects on the immune system are not completely understood, but the epithelium may be a crucial player  in the orchestration of the effects induced. in a previous work, we observed that some orally administered strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased the number of immunoglobulin a (iga)-producing cells in the small intestine without a concomitant increase in the cd4(+) t-cell population, indicating that some lab strains induce clonal expansion only of b cells triggered to produce iga. the present work aimed to study the cytokines induced by the interaction of probiotic lab with murine intestinal epithelial cells (iec) in healthy animals. we focused  our investigation mainly on the secretion of interleukin 6 (il-6) necessary for the clonal expansion of b cells previously observed with probiotic bacteria. the  role of toll-like receptors (tlrs) in such interaction was also addressed. the cytokines released by primary cultures of iec in animals fed with lactobacillus casei crl 431 or lactobacillus helveticus r389 were determined. cytokines were also determined in the supernatants of primary cultures of iec of unfed animals challenged with different concentrations of viable or nonviable lactobacilli and  escherichia coli, previously blocked or not with anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4. we concluded that the small intestine is the place where a major distinction would occur between probiotic lab and pathogens. this distinction comprises the type of cytokines released and the magnitude of the response, cutting across the line that separates il-6 necessary for b-cell differentiation, which was the case with probiotic lactobacilli, from inflammatory levels of il-6 for pathogens.

TI  == identification of endopeptidase genes from the genomic sequence of lactobacillus  helveticus cnrz32 and the role of these genes in hydrolysis of model bitter peptides.
AB  == genes encoding three putative endopeptidases were identified from a draft-quality genome sequence of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 and designated pepo3, pepf, and pepe2. the ability of cell extracts from escherichia coli dh5alpha derivatives expressing cnrz32 endopeptidases pepe, pepe2, pepf, pepo, pepo2, and  pepo3 to hydrolyze the model bitter peptides, beta-casein (beta-cn) (f193-209) and alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) (f1-9), under cheese-ripening conditions (ph  5.1, 4% nacl, and 10 degrees c) was examined. cnrz32 pepo3 was determined to be a functional paralog of pepo2 and hydrolyzed both peptides, while pepe and pepf had unique specificities towards alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9) and beta-cn (f193-209), respectively. cnrz32 pepe2 and pepo did not hydrolyze either peptide under these  conditions. to demonstrate the utility of these peptidases in cheese, pepe, pepo2, and pepo3 were expressed in lactococcus lactis, a common cheese starter, using a high-copy vector ptrkh2 and under the control of the pepo3 promoter. cell extracts of l. lactis derivatives expressing these peptidases were used to hydrolyze beta-cn (f193-209) and alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9) under cheese-ripening conditions in single-peptide reactions, in a defined peptide mix, and in cheddar  cheese serum. peptides alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9), alpha(s1)-cn (f1-13), and alpha(s1)-cn (f1-16) were identified from cheddar cheese serum and included in the defined peptide mix. our results demonstrate that in all systems examined, pepo2 and pepo3 had the highest activity with beta-cn (f193-209) and alpha(s1)-cn (f1-9). cheese-derived peptides were observed to affect the activity of some of the enzymes examined, underscoring the importance of incorporating such peptides  in model systems. these data indicate that l. helveticus cnrz32 endopeptidases pepo2 and pepo3 are likely to play a key role in this strain's ability to reduce  bitterness in cheese.

TI  == induction of a humoral immune response following an escherichia coli o157:h7 infection with an immunomodulatory peptidic fraction derived from lactobacillus helveticus-fermented milk.
AB  == numerous beneficial effects have been attributed to probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as the stimulation of the immune system, the prevention of enteric infections by enteropathogens, and the regression of immunodependent tumors. it has been shown that biologically active metabolites released during fermentation, in particular biopeptides, could act as immunomodulatory agents. however, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the implication of these bioactive peptides in the induction of a protective immune response against enteric infections. the present study aimed to evaluate the possible immunomodulatory and anti-infectious effects of a peptidic fraction released in milk fermented by lactobacillus helveticus. the immune response in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue was monitored following an administration of the potentially bioactive peptidic fraction. the total immunoglobulin a (iga) immune response was evaluated after an escherichia coli o157:h7 infection in a balb/c murine model. immunohistochemical and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed an increase in the number of iga-secreting b lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria and an enhanced total secretory and systemic iga response. cytokine profiling also revealed stimulation of a th2 response in mice  fed the peptidic fraction, whereas infected controls demonstrated a proinflammatory th1 response. these results indicate that bioactive peptides released during fermentation by lab could contribute to the known immunomodulatory effects of probiotic bacteria.

AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == impaired growth rates in milk of lactobacillus helveticus peptidase mutants can be overcome by use of amino acid supplements.
AB  == to evaluate the contribution of intracellular peptidases to the growth of the 14-amino-acid (aa) auxotroph lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32, single- and multiple-peptidase-deletion mutants were constructed. two broad-specificity aminopeptidases (pepc and pepn) and x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) were inactivated through successive cycles of chromosomal gene replacement mutagenesis. the inactivation of all three peptidases in jls247 ((delta)pepc (delta)pepn (delta)pepx) did not affect the growth rate in amino acid-defined medium. however, the peptidase mutants generally had decreased specific growth rates when acquisition of amino acids required hydrolysis of the proteins in milk, the most significant result being a 73% increase in generation time for jls247. the growth rate deficiencies in milk were overcome by amino acid supplements with some specificity to each of the peptidase mutants. for example,  milk supplementation with pro resulted in the most significant growth rate increase for (delta)pepx strains and a 7-aa supplement (asn, cys, ile, pro, ser,  thr, and val) resulted in a jls247 growth rate indistinguishable from that of the wild type. our results show that characterization of the activities of the broad-specificity aminopeptidases had little predictive value regarding the amino acid supplements found to enhance the milk growth rates of the peptidase mutant strains. these results represent the first determination of the physiological roles with respect to specific amino acid requirements for peptidase mutants grown in milk.

AB  == walker and klaenhammer (2001) developed a novel expression system in lactococcus  lactis that facilitated the release of beta-galactosidase (117 kda monomer) without the need for secretion or export signals. the system is based on the controlled expression of integrated prophage holin and lysin cassettes via a lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 transcriptional activator (tac31a) that resides on a high-copy plasmid. approximately 85% of beta-galactosidase activity was detected in the supernatant of leaky lactococci without evidence of hindered growth, cell lysis, or membrane damage. the objective of this study was to determine if intracellular peptidases were externalized from leaky lactococci. five l. lactis peptidases (pepa, pepc, pepn, pepo and pepxp) and two lactobacillus helveticus peptidases (pepn and pepo) were cloned and overexpressed on two high-copy vectors. the lactococcal peptidases were also cloned into the high-copy vector that contained the tac31a transcriptional activator to determine if they were externalized from the leaky prophage-containing l. lactis subsp. lactis strain nck203. two of the lactococcal peptidases (pepa and pepo) required  an additional strong promoter (lactobacillus paracasei p144) and optimized assay  conditions to detect enzyme activity. results showed different levels of enzymatic overexpression associated with the cellular fraction (2 to 250-fold increases in activity) and negligible amounts of activity present within the supernatant fraction (0 to 6% of total peptidase activity). the lactococcal phage-based protein release mechanism did not facilitate the externalization of the lactococcal peptidases investigated in this study.

AB  == nad-dependent lactobacillus bulgaricus d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-ldhb) catalyses the reversible conversion of pyruvate into d-lactate. crystals of d-ldhb complexed with nadh were grown and x-ray data collected to 2.2 a. the structure of d-ldhb was solved by molecular replacement using the dimeric lactobacillus helveticus d-ldh as a model and was refined to an r-factor of 20.7%. the two subunits of the enzyme display strong asymmetry due to different crystal environments. the opening angles of the two catalytic domains with respect to the core coenzyme binding domains differ by 16 degrees. subunit a is in an "open" conformation typical for a dehydrogenase apo enzyme and subunit b is "closed". the nadh-binding site in subunit a is only 30% occupied, while in subunit b it is fully occupied and there is a sulphate ion in the substrate-binding pocket. a pyruvate molecule has been modelled in the active site and its orientation is in  agreement with existing kinetic and structural data. on domain closure, a cluster of hydrophobic residues packs tightly around the methyl group of the modelled pyruvate molecule. at least three residues from this cluster govern the substrate specificity. substrate binding itself contributes to the stabilisation of domain  closure and activation of the enzyme. in pyruvate reduction, d-ldh can adapt another protonated residue, a lysine residue, to accomplish the role of the acid  catalyst his296. required lowering of the lysine pk(a) value is explained on the  basis of the h296k mutant structure.

TI  == functional cloning, heterologous expression, and purification of two different n-deoxyribosyltransferases from lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus contains two types of n-deoxyribosyltransferases: drtase i catalyzes the transfer of 2'-deoxyribose between purine bases exclusively whereas drtase ii is able to transfer the 2'-deoxyribose between two pyrimidine or between pyrimidine and purine bases. an escherichia coli strain, auxotrophic for guanine and unable to use deoxyguanosine as source of guanine, was constructed to clone the corresponding genes. by screening a genomic bank for the production of guanine, the l. helveticus ptd and ntd genes coding for drtase i and ii, respectively, were isolated. although the two genes have no sequence similarity, the two deduced polypeptides display 25.6% identity, with most of the residues involved in substrate binding and the active site nucleophile glu-98 being conserved. overexpression and purification of the two proteins shows that drtase i is specific for purines with a preference for deoxyinosine (di) > deoxyadenosine > deoxyguanosine as donor substrates whereas drtase ii has a strong preference for pyrimidines as donor substrates and purines as base acceptors. purine analogues were substrates as acceptor bases for both enzymes. comparison of drtase i and drtase ii activities with di as donor or hypoxanthine  as acceptor and colocalization of the ptd and add genes suggest a specific role for drtase i in the metabolism of di.

AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, like many other bacteria, harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein (s(a)-protein) of 43 kda. s(a)-protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge. reconstruction of the s-layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions (a=118 a; b=53 a, and gamma=102 degrees ) resembling those determined for the s-layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046. sequence comparison of s(a)-protein with s-proteins from l. helveticus, lactobacillus crispatus and the  s-proteins encoded by the silent s-protein genes from l. acidophilus and l. crispatus suggested the presence of two domains, one comprising the n-terminal two-thirds (san), and another made up of the c-terminal one-third (sac) of s(a)-protein. the sequence of the n-terminal domains is variable, while that of the c-terminal domain is highly conserved in the s-proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat. proteolytic digestion of s(a)-protein showed that san was protease-resistant, suggesting a compact structure. sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure. dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac (gfp-sac) were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli. purified san could crystallize into mono and multi-layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic s(a)-protein. a calculated s(a)-protein minus san density-difference map revealed the probable location, in projection, of the sac  domain, which is missing from the truncated san peptide. the gfp-sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l. acidophilus, l. helveticus and l.  crispatus cells from which the s-layer had been removed, but not to non-stripped  cells or to lactobacillus casei.

TI  == a lactobacillus helveticus plasmid detects restriction fragment length polymorphism in different bacterial species.
AB  == a small cryptic lactobacillus helveticus plasmid, plbl4, was able to reveal restriction fragment length polymorphism in different bacterial species including lactobacillus species, bacillus species, and escherichia coli when used as a dna  probe. the observed polymorphism was a result of the combined hybridization of several microsatellite sequences. the 6-bp sequence (ttgttt) was repeated 12 times, seven of which were concentrated within the region between 1791 and 1997 bp of the plasmid sequence. the polymorphic patterns generated with plbl4 differed from those obtained with m13 dna in the larger number of bands observed. the results presented here open the possibility of using plbl4 as a new broad-spectrum polymorphic dna probe for fingerprint analysis.

TI  == expression of the phospho-beta-glycosidase arbz from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis in lactobacillus helveticus: substrate induction and catabolite repression.
AB  == arbz from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis was previously shown to enable  utilization of the beta-glucoside arbutin by escherichia coli. the arbz gene was  cloned and expressed in the industrially used beta-glucoside-negative strain lactobacillus helveticus 3036(62). the transformants were able to ferment not only arbutin, but also cellobiose, salicin and methyl-beta-glucoside (mbetaglc).  cleavage of beta-glucosides by the transformants depended on the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas in cell-free extracts only c(6)-phosphorylated substrates were hydrolysed. this suggested that arbz is a phospho-beta-glycosidase. arbz activity in transformants of lb. helveticus was subject to substrate induction mediated by the beta-glucosides arbutin, salicin and mbetaglc, whereas cellobiose or the beta-galactoside lactose had no inducing  effect. northern blot analysis proved that induction by mbetaglc was due to enhanced transcription of arbz. catabolite repression of arbz induction was observed with glucose, mannose, fructose and galactose. the induction kinetics observed in the presence of these sugars indicated that at least two different mechanisms are operative in catabolite repression of arbz in lb. helveticus.

AB  == a 2.6-kilobase haeiii dna fragment corresponding to an extracellular proteinase gene (prty) was cloned from chromosomal dna of lactobacillus helveticus cp790 in  escherichia coli using a pkk223-3 vector. the transformant expressed a 48-kda protein that reacts with monoclonal antibodies specific to the proteinase and seemed to be a pre-proproteinase, but had no proteolytic activity. about 1.6 kilobases of the 2.6-kilobase dna fragment, which contained the complete gene for the proteinase was sequenced. sequence analysis found an open reading frame with  a capacity to encode a protein of 449 amino acids. the coding region contained a  gram-positive-type signal peptide of 30 amino acids. the n-terminal sequences of  the proproteinase and the mature proteinase have been observed in the polypeptide at position + 31 and + 38. the putative amino acid sequence showed a significant  similarity to a surface layer protein of l. helveticus and lactobacillus acidophilus in the amino terminal signal sequence and carboxyl terminus.

TI  == high pressure inactivation of microorganisms inoculated into ovine milk of different fat contents.
AB  == high hydrostatic pressure inactivation of escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus helveticus were studied. these microorganisms were inoculated at a concentration  between 10(7) and 10(8) cfu/ml in ringer solution and in ovine milk adjusted to 0, 6, and 50% fat content to evaluate the baroprotective effect of fat content on inactivation of microorganisms. treatments of pressurization consisted of combinations of pressure (100 to 500 mpa) and temperature (4, 25, and 50 degrees  c) for 15 min. gram-negative microorganisms were more sensitive than were gram-positive ones (more destruction p. fluorescens > e. coli > or = list. innocua > lb. helveticus > s. aureus). pressurizations at low temperature (4 degrees c) produced greater inactivation on p. fluorescens, list. innocua, and lb. helveticus than at room temperature (25 degrees c), whereas for e. coli and s. aureus the results were opposite. ovine milk per se (0% fat) showed a baroprotective effect on all microorganisms, but percentage of fat (6 and 50%) did not show a progressive baroprotective effect in all pressurization conditions or for all microorganisms.

TI  == x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene (pepx) is part of the glnra operon in lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == a peptidase gene expressing x-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (pepx) activity was cloned from lactobacillus rhamnosus 1/6 by using the chromogenic substrate l-glycyl-l-prolyl-beta-naphthylamide for screening of a genomic library in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of a 3.5-kb hindiii fragment expressing the peptidase activity revealed one complete open reading frame (orf) of 2,391 nucleotides. the 797-amino-acid protein encoded by this orf was shown to be 40, 39, and 36% identical with pepxs from lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and lactococcus lactis, respectively. by northern analysis with a pepx-specific probe, transcripts of 4.5 and 7.0 kb were detected, indicating that pepx is part of a polycistronic operon in l. rhamnosus. cloning and sequencing of the upstream region of pepx revealed the presence of two orfs of 360 and 1,338 bp that were shown to be able to encode proteins with high homology to glnr and glna proteins, respectively. by multiple primer extension analyses, the only functional promoter in the pepx region was located 25 nucleotides upstream of glnr. northern analysis with glna- and pepx-specific probes indicated that transcription from glnr promoter results in a 2.0-kb dicistronic glnr-glna transcript and also in a longer read-through polycistronic transcript of 7.0 kb that was detected with both probes in samples from cells in exponential growth phase. the glna gene was disrupted by a single-crossover recombinant event using  a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an internal part of glna. in the disruption mutant, glnra-specific transcription was derepressed 10-fold compared to the wild type, but the 7.0-kb transcript was no longer detectable with either the glna- or pepx-specific probe, demonstrating that pepx is indeed part of glnra operon in l. rhamnosus. reverse transcription-pcr analysis further supported this operon structure. an extended stem-loop structure was identified immediately upstream of pepx in the glna-pepx intergenic region, a sequence that showed homology to a 23s-5s intergenic spacer and to several other l. rhamnosus-related entries in data banks.

TI  == molecular characterization of a stress-inducible gene from lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == a gene (htra) coding for a stress-inducible htra-like protein from lactobacillus  helveticus cnrz32 was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene exhibited 30% identity with the htra protein from escherichia coli; the putative catalytic triad and a pdz domain that characterize the htra family of known bacterial serine proteases were also found in the sequence. expression of the l. helveticus htra gene in a variety of stress conditions was analyzed at the transcriptional level. the strongest induction, resulting in over an eightfold increase in the htra transcription level, was found in growing cnrz32 cells exposed to 4% (wt/vol) nacl. enhanced htra mrna expression was also seen in cnrz32 cells after exposure to puromycin, ethanol, or heat. the reporter gene gusa was integrated in the lactobacillus chromosome downstream of the htra promoter by a double-crossover event which also interrupted the wild-type gene. the expression of gusa in the stress conditions tested was similar to that of htra itself. in addition, the presence of an intact htra gene facilitated growth under heat stress but not under salt stress.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == lactobacillus helveticus cnrz 892 contains a surface layer (s-layer) composed of  protein monomers of 43 kda organized in regular arrays. the gene encoding this protein (slph) has been cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. slph consists of 440 codons and is preceded by a ribosome-binding site (rbs) and followed by a  putative rho-independent terminator. indeed, northern analysis revealed that slph is a monocistronic gene. the gene is preceded by a possible promotor of which the -35 and -10 hexanucleotides are separated by 17 nt. by primer extension analysis  the transcription start site was mapped at 7 nt downstream of the -10 sequence while the deduced amino acid sequence of slph shows a leader peptide of 30 aa. the slph gene has been amplified by pcr and the fragment, carrying the complete gene from the rbs to the stop codon, has been cloned in a lactococcal gene expression vector downstream of promoter p32. lactococcus lactis mg1363 carrying  the resulting plasmid produced and secreted an s-layer monomer with the same molecular mass as the authentic l. helveticus cnrz 892 slph, as judged by sds-page. immunoelectron microscopy revealed that slph was bound to the lactococcal cell walls in small clumps and accumulated in the growth medium as small sheets.

AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

TI  == an operon from lactobacillus helveticus composed of a proline iminopeptidase gene (pepi) and two genes coding for putative members of the abc transporter family of proteins.
AB  == a proline iminopeptidase gene (pepi) of an industrial lactobacillus helveticus strain was cloned and found to be organized in an operon-like structure of three  open reading frames (orf1, orf2 and orf3). orf1 was preceded by a typical prokaryotic promoter region, and a putative transcription terminator was found downstream of orf3, identified as the pepi gene. using primer-extension analyses, only one transcription start site, upstream of orf1, was identifiable in the predicted operon. although the size of mrna could not be judged by northern analysis either with orf1-, orf2- or pepi-specific probes, reverse transcription-pcr analyses further supported the operon structure of the three genes. orf1, orf2 and orf3 had coding capacities for 50.7, 24.5 and 33.8 kda proteins, respectively. the orf3-encoded pepi protein showed 65% identity with the pepi proteins from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis. the orf1-encoded protein had significant homology with several members of the abc transporter family but, with two distinct putative atp-binding sites, it would represent an unusual type among the bacterial abc transporters. orf2 encoded a putative integral membrane protein also characteristic of the abc transporter family. the pepi gene was overexpressed in escherichia coli. purified pepi hydrolysed only di and tripeptides with proline in the first position. optimum pepi activity was observed at ph 7.5 and 40 degrees c. a gel filtration analysis indicated that pepi is a dimer of m(r) 53,000. pepi was shown to be a metal-independent serine peptidase having thiol groups at or near the active site. kinetic studies with proline-p-nitroanilide as substrate revealed km and vmax values of 0.8 mm and 350 mmol min-1 mg-1, respectively, and a very high turnover number of 135,000 s-1.

AB  == lactobacillus (lb.) helveticus cnrz32 possesses a 97-kda metalloenzyme with aminopeptidase activity (pepn; ec 3.4.11.2). a 3.8-kb fragment encoding pepn was  cloned into pil253 and designated psuw34. transformation of lactococcus (lc.) lactis lm0230 with psuw34 resulted in > 180-fold increase in general aminopeptidase (ap) activity using l-lysine-p-nitroanilide. southern hybridization was conducted to determine the distribution of homology to the cnrz32 pepn gene among lactic-acid bacteria (lab). hybridization was observed with strains of lactobacilli, pediococci, leuconostoc, streptococci and lactococci. the pepn gene was sequenced and found to encode a protein containing  844 amino acid (aa) residues. a comparison of lb. helveticus cnrz32 pepn to lb. delbrueckii ssp. lactis dsm7290 pepn indicated 69.5% nucleotide (nt) identity and 71.8% aa identity, while comparison to pepn from lc. lactis ssp. cremoris mg1363  indicated 61.1% nt identity and 49.2% aa identity. alignment of peptidase aa sequences of lab, escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian origin display homology in the zinc-binding domain, as well as a conserved region upstream from the putative active site.

TI  == molecular cloning and dna sequence analysis of pepl, a leucyl aminopeptidase gene from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis dsm7290.
AB  == a genomic library of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis dsm7290 dna fragments from a sau3a partial digestion in the low-copy-number vector plg339, was used to screen escherichia coli for the presence of peptidases. using the chromogenic substrate leucine-beta-naphthylamide (leu-nh-nap) and e. coli strain  cm89 lacking the corresponding enzyme activity in an enzymic plate assay, allowed the isolation of two peptidase genes; the newly described pepl and the recently cloned and sequenced pepn. clones could be distinguished not only by the restriction pattern of isolated plasmids but also by the rate and intensity of their colour reaction with leu-nh-nap. three out of five clones were identified to express the lactobacillus pepn gene; the others were shown to express a second aminopeptidase gene, designated pepl. this gene, together with 200 bp upstream of the proposed aug initiation codon, was further subcloned and sequenced. the corresponding open reading frame of 897 nucleotides is predicted to encode a protein of 299 amino acids (34,541 da). searching the embl database revealed similarity to the prolinase of lactobacillus helveticus (45.8% identity), to the  iminopeptidases of lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (25.5%), and to the bacillus coagulans prolinase (21.5%). minor similarities were detected for hydrolytic enzymes with serine active sites. the product encoded by the pepl gene was functional but could not be visualized on coomassie-blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. high level expression of peptidase l  in e. coli was achieved by placing the gene under the control of the t7 promoter.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis of the lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis dsm7290 cysteine aminopeptidase gene pepc.
AB  == a genomic library of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis dsm7290 in the low copy number vector plg339, was screened for the presence of peptidase genes. using the chromogenic substrate gly-ala-beta-naphthylamide, which is not a substrate for any of the recently cloned peptidases of dsm7290, and the multiple  peptidase deficient escherichia coli strain cm89, allowed the isolation of clones, which contained the equivalent hydrolytic activity. to identify genes encoding the conserved catalytic active site of cysteine proteases, partial nucleotide sequencing with a degenerate oligonucleotide was performed on recombinant plasmids isolated from such clones. this allowed to identify two out  of nine clones to carry the lactobacillus pepc gene. a total of 2026 nucleotides  were determined, and sequence analysis revealed a gene with strong homology to the recently cloned lb. helveticus (73.2%) and lactococcus lactis (51.03%) pepc genes, and the derived protein showed homology with the active site of a large number of cysteine proteases. the predicted open reading frame consists of 449 codons, coding for a protein of 50,909 da. the enzyme is functional and extremely overexpressed in e. coli.

TI  == cloning, characterization and insertional inactivation of the lactobacillus helveticus d(-) lactate dehydrogenase gene.
AB  == a plasmid, designated psuw100, encoding the d(-)lactate dehydrogenase [d(-)-ldh;  nad+ oxidoreductase, ec 1.1.1.28] from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32 was identified from a genomic library by complementation of escherichia coli fmj39. the d(-)ldh gene was localized by tn5 mutagenesis and subcloning to a 1.4-kb region of psuw100. a 2-kb drai fragment of psuw100 encoding d(-)ldh activity was  subcloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. analysis of this sequence identified a putative 1,014-bp d(-)ldh open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide of 337 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 38 kda. the distribution of homology to the cnrz32 d(-)ldh gene in several lactic acid bacteria was determined by southern hybridization using an internal fragment of the d(-)ldh gene as a probe. hybridization was detected in leuconostocs and pediococci but not in lactococci or lactobacillus casei. an integration plasmid was constructed from psa3 and a 0.60-kb internal fragment of the d(-)ldh gene. this plasmid was used to construct a d(-)ldh-negative derivative of l. helveticus cnrz 32 by gene disruption; this derivative was determined as producing only l(+)lactic acid. no significant difference in growth or total lactic acid production was observed between cnrz32 and its d(-)ldh mutant.

TI  == divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
AB  == we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in  the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from  that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in  part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus  rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.

TI  == cloning and overexpression of lactobacillus helveticus d-lactate dehydrogenase gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == nad(+)-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus helveticus was purified to apparent homogeneity, and the sequence of the first 36 amino acid residues determined. using forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers, based on  the n-terminal sequence and amino acid residues 220-215 of the lactobacillus bulgaricus enzyme [kochhar, s., hunziker, p. e., leong-morgenthaler, p. & hottinger, h. (1992) j. biol. chem. 267, 8499-8513], a 0.6-kbp dna fragment was amplified from l. helveticus genomic dna by the polymerase chain reaction. this amplified dna fragment was used as a probe to identify two recombinant clones containing the d-lactate dehydrogenase gene. both plasmids overexpressed d-lactate dehydrogenase (greater than 60% total soluble cell protein) and were stable in escherichia coli, compared to plasmids carrying the l. bulgaricus and lactobacillus plantarum genes. the entire nucleotide sequence of the l. helveticus d-lactate dehydrogenase gene was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence indicated a polypeptide consisting of 336 amino acid residues, which showed significant amino acid sequence similarity to the recently identified family of d-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases [kochhar, s., hunziker, p. e., leong-morgenthaler, p. & hottinger, h. (1992) biochem. biophys. res. commun. 184, 60-66]. the physicochemical and catalytic properties of recombinant d-lactate dehydrogenase were identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, e.g. alpha 2 dimeric subunit structure, isoelectric ph, km and kcat for pyruvate and other 2-oxo-acid substrates. the kinetic profiles of 2-oxo-acid substrates showed some  marked differences from that of l-lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting different mechanisms for substrate binding and specificity.

TI  == establishment of a host-vector system in lactobacillus helveticus with beta-galactosidase activity as a selection marker.
AB  == a host-vector system was established in lactobacillus helveticus with beta-galactosidase activity as a selection marker. plasmid pbg10 was constructed  by joining the beta-galactosidase gene from l. bulgaricus, the promoter region of the erythromycin resistance gene from pam beta 1, the replication region of pbr329, and the replication region of the l. helveticus cryptic plasmid plj1. l.  helveticus sbt2195 (lac- mutant), transformed with pbg10, was selected on skim milk plates. the structural gene of alpha-amylase (1536 bp) from bacillus licheniformis, inserted downstream of the promoter region of the erythromycin resistance gene of pbg10, was expressed in l. helveticus sbt2195. plasmid pbg10 is a food-grade and expression vector in l. helveticus.

TI  == galactose utilization in lactobacillus helveticus: isolation and characterization of the galactokinase (galk) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (galt) genes.
AB  == by complementing appropriate gal lesions in escherichia coli k802, we were able to isolate the galactokinase (galk) and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase  (galt) genes of lactobacillus helveticus. tn10 transposon mutagenesis, together with in vivo complementation analysis and in vitro enzyme activity measurements,  allowed us to map these two genes. the dna sequences of the genes and the flanking regions were determined. these revealed that the two genes are organized in the order galk-galt in an operonlike structure. in an in vitro transcription-translation assay, the galk and galt gene products were identified  as 44- and 53-kda proteins, respectively, data which corresponded well with the dna sequencing data. the deduced amino acid sequence of the galk gene product showed significant homologies to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic galactokinase sequences, whereas galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase did not show any sequence similarities to other known proteins. this observation, together with a  comparison of known gal operon structures, suggested that the l. helveticus operon developed independently to a translational expression unit having a different gene order than that in e. coli, streptococcus lividans, or saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna sequencing of the flanking regions revealed an open reading frame downstream of the galkt operon. it was tentatively identified as galm (mutarotase) on the basis of the significant amino acid sequence homology with the corresponding streptococcus thermophilus gene.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == evidence for a plasmid-linked restriction-modification system in lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == the presence of a restriction-modification (r/m) system against two bacteriophages, 328-b1 and hv, was demonstrated in three lactobacillus helveticus strains, cnrz 1094, cnrz 1095, and cnrz 1096. in addition, the burst size of phage 328-b1 in the three restrictive strains cnrz 1094, cnrz 1095, and cnrz 1096 was reduced with respect to the values obtained in its propagating strain, cnrz 328. heating at 60 degrees c did not inactivate the r/m system. nonrestrictive variants from cnrz 1094 were easily obtained under several culture conditions, but treatment with novobiocin at 42 degrees c followed by storage at -20 degrees  c resulted in drastic elimination of the r/m phenotype from all clones tested. electrophoretic analysis of cnrz 1094 nonrestrictive variants revealed the concomitant loss of a 34-kb plasmid. four ecori fragments from the 34-kb plasmid  were cloned in the escherichia coli vector pacyc184. the use of one or several of these fragments as probes confirmed the plasmidic location of the genes responsible for the r/m system. these probes also showed the presence of r/m plasmids in the two other restrictive strains, cnrz 1095 and cnrz 1096. lactose-fermenting ability and/or proteolytic capacity was not linked to the 34-kb plasmid.

TI  == cloning, expression, and nucleotide sequence of the lactobacillus helveticus 481  gene encoding the bacteriocin helveticin j.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus 481 produces a 37-kda bacteriocin called helveticin j. libraries of chromosomal dna from l. helveticus were prepared in lambda gt11 and  probed for phage-producing fusion proteins that could react with polyclonal helveticin j antibody. two recombinant phage, hj1 and hj4, containing homologous  inserts of 350 and 600 bp, respectively, produced proteins that reacted with antibody. these two phage clones specifically hybridized to l. helveticus 481 total genomic dna but not to dna from strains that did not produce helveticin j or strains producing unrelated bacteriocins. hj1 and hj4 lysogens produced beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that shared similar epitopes with each other and helveticin j. the intact helveticin j gene (hlv) was isolated by screening a  library of l. helveticus chromosomal dna in lambda embl3 with the insert dna from phage hj4 as a probe. the dna sequence of a contiguous 3,364-bp region was determined. two complete open reading frames (orf), designated orf2 and orf3, were identified within the sequenced fragment. the 3' end of another open reading frame, orf1, was located upstream of orf2. a noncoding region and a putative promoter were located between orf1 and orf2. orf2 could encode an 11,808-da protein. the l. helveticus dna inserts of the hj1 and hj4 clones reside within orf3, which begins 30 bp downstream from the termination codon of orf2. orf3 could encode a 37,511-da protein. downstream from orf3, the 5' end of another orf (orf4) was found. a bg/ii fragment containing orf2 and orf3 was cloned into pgk12, and the recombinant plasmid, ptrk135, was transformed into lactobacillus acidophilus via electroporation. transformants carrying ptrk135 produced a bacteriocin that was heat labile and exhibited an acitivity spectrum that was the same as that of helveticin j.
