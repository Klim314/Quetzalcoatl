TI  == antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the  centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial  activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis  atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).

TI  == observations on the current bacteriological profile of chronic suppurative otitis media in south eastern nigeria.
AB  == background: chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) is a disease well-known for its recurrence and persistence despite treatment. the situation is compounded by  the increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents by bacteria these days. aim: this study was carried out to examine the current local bacteriological profile of csom and to compare the profile of either ear in bilaterally discharging ears. materials and methods: we carried out a retrospective analysis of ear swab cultures from 133 unilateral and 73 bilateral consecutive tubotympanic csom cases seen at the ear-nose-throat clinics of a referral health institution during a 4 year period ending 2013. sensitivities to eight locally available antibiotics were analyzed. aerobic bacterial isolates were analyzed separately for the unilateral and bilateral cases. comparison was made between the ears in the bilateral cases. results: we analyzed 279 ear swab culture results from 206 patients with age ranging from 5 months to 86 years and a mean of 21.3 (19.5) years. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolated bacteria (44% [109/250]) followed by staphylococcus aureus (17% [42/250]), and proteus mirabilis (15% [38/250]). the most and least sensitive bacteria were klebsiella spp and escherichia coli, respectively. the most effective antibiotics were gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. the two ears differ significantly in the rates of isolation of s. aureus and e. coli (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). conclusion: pseudomonas is the most common bacteria involved in csom in this part of the country. ciprofloxacin as ear drops is recommended as first-line drug in the management of active csom as it is cheap, less ototoxic, and locally available. separate ear swab culture should be obtained in bilateral csom.

TI  == colonization, competition, and dispersal of pathogens in fluid flow networks.
AB  == the colonization of bacteria in complex fluid flow networks, such as those found  in host vasculature, remains poorly understood. recently, it was reported that many bacteria, including bacillus subtilis [1], escherichia coli [2], and pseudomonas aeruginosa [3, 4], can move in the opposite direction of fluid flow.  upstream movement results from the interplay between fluid shear stress and bacterial motility structures, and such rheotactic-like behavior is predicted to  occur for a wide range of conditions [1]. given the potential ubiquity of upstream movement, its impact on population-level behaviors within hosts could be significant. here, we find that p. aeruginosa communities use a diverse set of motility strategies, including a novel surface-motility mechanism characterized by counter-advection and transverse diffusion, to rapidly disperse throughout vasculature-like flow networks. these motility modalities give p. aeruginosa a selective growth advantage, enabling it to self-segregate from other human pathogens such as proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus that outcompete p.  aeruginosa in well-mixed non-flow environments. we develop a quantitative model of bacterial colonization in flow networks, confirm our model in vivo in plant vasculature, and validate a key prediction that colonization and dispersal can be inhibited by modifying surface chemistry. our results show that the interaction between flow mechanics and motility structures shapes the formation of mixed-species communities and suggest a general mechanism by which bacteria could colonize hosts. furthermore, our results suggest novel strategies for tuning the  composition of multi-species bacterial communities in hosts, preventing inappropriate colonization in medical devices, and combatting bacterial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
AB  == purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and  fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the  complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == biomaterial modification of urinary catheters with antimicrobials to give long-term broadspectrum antibiofilm activity.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection, accounting for over 100,000 hospital admissions within the usa annually. biomaterials and processes intended to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of the catheters for long-term users have not been successful, mainly because of the need for long duration of activity in flow conditions. here we report the results of impregnation of urinary catheters with  a combination of rifampicin, sparfloxacin and triclosan. in flow experiments, the antimicrobial catheters were able to prevent colonization by common uropathogens  proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli for 7 to 12weeks in vitro compared with 1-3days for other, commercially available antimicrobial catheters currently used clinically. resistance development was minimized by careful choice of antimicrobial combinations. drug release profiles and distribution in the polymer, and surface analysis were also carried out and the process had no deleterious effect on the mechanical performance of the catheter or its balloon. the antimicrobial catheter therefore offers for the first time a  means of reducing infection and its complications in long-term urinary catheter users.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with normal  and altered glycated hemoglobin levels in two regions in brazil.
AB  == purpose: to study the aerobic bacterial microbiota of the conjunctiva in diabetic patients with regard to the management of diabetes, assessed using glycated hemoglobin levels. methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted using conjunctival smears of diabetic patients from both sexes and with different ages, residing in two different brazilian cities (sorocaba and rio branco). a control group of non-diabetic patients was also included. the diabetic patients were considered to have controlled diabetes when their glycated hemoglobin level was </=7% and blood glucose level was </=126 mg/dl. patients with non-controlled diabetes were those with glycated hemoglobin levels >7% and blood glucose levels  >126 mg/dl. the samples obtained were inoculated in brain-heart infusion broth and in culture media for aerobic bacteria (blood and chocolate agars); bacterial  growth was evaluated in a microbiology laboratory. results: a total of 120 eyes of 120 patients were included in the present study. the percentage of cultures in which bacterial growth was observed was greater in diabetic patients, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.103). there was a greater trend toward bacterial growth in the conjunctiva of diabetic patients with altered fasting blood glucose. there was no difference in the frequency of bacterial growth on the conjunctiva between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. in sorocaba, conjunctival bacterial growth was similar to that observed in rio branco. the microorganism most frequently detected in the present study was staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. conclusion: there was no difference between diabetic patients with normal or altered glycated hemoglobin levels. the microorganisms found were similar to those found in studies investigating the conjunctival bacterial flora of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

TI  == identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  == chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. it is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. the purpose of this study was to identify the  bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. a number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. the isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), proteus mirabilis (1), citrobacter freundii (1), group g beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). in comparison to the other isolates, p. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by s. aureus, with insignificant differences between mrsa and non-methicillin resistant isolates. the enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. the isolation of mrsa, esbl-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant p. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. this study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. however, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == preparation and characterization of new biologically active polyurethane foams.
AB  == biologically active polyurethane foams are the fast-developed alternative to many applications of biomedical materials. due to the polyurethane structure features  and foam technology it is possible to incorporate into their structure the biologically active compounds of target purpose via structural-chemical modification of macromolecule. a series of new biologically active polyurethane foams (pufs) was synthesized with polyethers (mm 2500-5000), polyesters mm (500-2200), 2,4(2,6) toluene diisocyanate, water as a foaming agent, catalysts, foam stabilizers and functional compounds. different functional compounds: 1,4-di-n-oxy-2,3-bis-(oxymethyl)-quinoxaline (domq), partial sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) and 2,6-dimethyl-n,n-diethyl aminoacetatanilide hydrochloride  were incorporated into the polymer structure/composition due to the chemical and/or physical bonding. structural peculiarities of pufs were studied by ftir spectroscopy and x-ray scattering. self-adhesion properties of pufs were estimated by measuring of tensile strength at break of adhesive junction. the optical microscopy method was performed for the puf morphology studies. toxicological estimation of the pufs was carried out in vitro and in vivo. the antibacterial action towards the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atc 25922, e. coli atc 2150, klebsiella pneumoniae 6447, staphylococcus aureus 180, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8180, proteus mirabilis f 403,  p. mirabilis 6054, and proteus vulgaris 8718) was studied by the disc method on the solid nutrient. physic-chemical properties of the pufs (density, tensile strength and elongation at break, water absorption and vapor permeability) showed that all studied pufs are within the operational requirements for such materials  and represent fine-cellular foams. spectral studies confirmed the incorporation of domq into the puf's macrochain. pufs are characterized by microheterogeneous structure. they are antibacterially active, non-toxic materials with high affinity to the tissue body, self-adhesive properties and local anesthetic effect.

TI  == flow cytometry analysis using sysmex uf-1000i classifies uropathogens based on bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens among patients with urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are the second most common bacterial infection. urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but new techniques, such as flow cytometry analysis (fca), have been introduced. the aim of the present study was to evaluate fca characteristics regarding bacteriuria, leukocyturia, and erythrocyturia in relation to cultured uropathogens in specimens from patients with a suspected uti. we also wanted to evaluate whether the fca characteristics  can identify uropathogens prior to culture. from a prospective study, 1,587 consecutive urine specimens underwent fca prior to culture during january and february 2012. outpatients and inpatients (79.6% and 19.4%, respectively) were included, of whom women represented 67.5%. in total, 620 specimens yielded growth, of which escherichia coli represented 65%, enterococcus spp. 8%, klebsiella spp. 7%, and staphylococcus spp. 5%. for the uropathogens, the outcome of fca was compared against the results for specimens with e. coli and those with a negative culture. e. coli had high bacterial (median, 17,914/mul), leukocyte (median, 348/mul), and erythrocyte (median, 23/mul) counts. with the exception of klebsiella spp., the majority of the uropathogens had considerable or significantly lower bacterial counts than that of e. coli. high leukocyte counts  were found in specimens with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group c streptococci. elevated erythrocyte counts were found for p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, and group c streptococci, as well as for staphylococcus saprophyticus. in essence, fca adds new information about the  bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens for different uropathogens. based on fca characteristics, uropathogens can be classified and identified prior to culture. e. coli and klebsiella spp. have similar fca characteristics.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  == background: the phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ast) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. the current study was performed in order to  test the influence of different ast standards on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption. methods: automated ast was performed with clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. from each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and mic data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by din and eucast, respectively. in addition cumulative ast data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new eucast mic breakpoints. results: the susceptibility rate of p. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of c. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of e. cloacae, s. marcescens, and m. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from din to eucast mic breakpoints. these changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of eucast mic breakpoints. conclusions: these data show that changes of ast breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative ast data and on antibiotic consumption.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: what we know and what we should know.
AB  == individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. these chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. however, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the sci population has not been well characterized. this study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci. an electronic literature search of medline (1966 to february 2014) was performed. eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the sci population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly.  the most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. in  general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci is quite rudimentary, at best. well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == proteus mirabilis and its role in dacryocystitis.
AB  == purpose: dacryocystitis is a common inflammation of the lacrimal sac, usually from an underlying bacterial infection. most cases can be attributed to common ocular flora such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae; however,  uncommon bacterial causes such as proteus mirabilis can still occur. p. mirabilis is a gram-negative bacillus that is found abundantly in people who have undergone long-term catheterization and is uncommonly found in or around the eyes except in people who have undergone long-term catheterization. proteus species can cause conjunctivitis, canaliculitis, and dacryocystitis and have the ability to manifest into preseptal cellulitis; therefore, timely recognition and treatment are important to prevent potential further complications. case report: an 84-year-old white man had several recurrences of acute dacryocystitis that had marginal improvement with empiric antibiotic treatment. resultant culture of the  ocular discharge revealed an uncommon bacterium, p. mirabilis. successful dosing  of oral antibiotics resolved the infection but ultimately the patient required an external dacryocystorhinostomy (dcr) procedure to maintain patency of the nasolacrimal lacrimal system and prevent recurrence. at 3 months after external dcr, the patient was symptom free with no recurrences. conclusions: dacryocystitis has a distinctive clinical presentation and is usually easily treated when appropriate oral antibiotics are directed at the underlying pathogen. in nonresponsive cases, culturing of the ocular discharge should be performed to identify the underlying pathogen. cases of dacryocystitis caused by  proteus species are usually responsive to several standard antibiotics used orally in eye care; however, culturing and susceptibility testing can streamline  the diagnostic and management sequence considerably in unclear or unresponsive cases. typically, patients with dacryocystitis return to normal after appropriate treatment, but chronic recurrences and epiphora are potential sequelae. patients  should be educated that a dcr surgical procedure may be needed to prevent future  recurrences in some cases.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == evaluation of bacteriostatic potency of expired oral paediatric antibiotics and implications on infant health.
AB  == introduction: in spite of significant risks, as well as non-clinical importance due to loss of potency, stiff penalties against administration of expired medications are still not appropriately enforced by health policy makers in many  developing countries, possibly because of little evidence to support that expired medications are hazardous. the purpose of this study therefore, was to investigate the effect of expiration dates on in vitro bacteriostatic potentials  of oral paediatric antibiotics. methods: comparative bacteriostatic potentials of 31 expired and seven corresponding unexpired oral paediatric antibiotics were determined on infantile diarrhoeagenic bacteria, using a modification of agar well-diffusion method. results: verall total percentage in vitro resistance rates against expired and unexpired paediatric antibiotics respectively were - e. coli  (</=100% vs. </=15.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (</=100% vs. </=31.3%), proteus mirabilis (</=91.7% vs. </=41.7%) and staphylococcus aureus (</=100% vs. </=18.2%). resistance rates of 45.5-55.8% (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim 5), 39.5-63.6% (amoxycillin 6), 46.5-54.5% (cotrimoxazole 7), 37.5-63.6% (ampicillin  + cloxacillin 18), and higher resistance rates of >/=75.0-100% were exhibited towards remaining expired antibiotics. higher total resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) rates were also recorded against expired antibiotics  (45.2-93.5%) compared to unexpired antibiotics (28.6-57.2%), except for few strains of e. coli and proteus mirabilis. furthermore, unexpired paediatric antibiotics exhibited wider zones of inhibition towards the test diarrhoeagenic bacteria (>/=25.0 mm diameter). conclusion: this study provided preliminary microbiological results on the appreciable reduction in in vitro bacteriostatic potentials, as well as higher resistance and multiple antibiotic resistance rates among expired oral paediatric antibiotics on infantile diarrhoeagenic bacteria. apart from less-efficacy, administration of expired antibiotics can lead to increased antibiotic resistance and clinical treatment failure, as well as adverse drug reactions.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles green-synthesized  using pineapple leaf (ananas comosus).
AB  == pineapple leaf was used in this study for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles based on the search for sustainable synthetic means. indeed, this offered an economical and sustainable synthetic route relative to expensive and toxic chemical methods. the leaf extract was used and the corresponding nanoparticles obtained were subjected to uv-vis analysis at different times. the uv-vis was used to monitor the silver nanoparticle formation through sampling at time intervals. the formation of silver nanoparticles was apparently displayed within  2 min with evidence of surface plasmon bands (spb) between 440 and 460 nm. the crystals was equally characterized using ftir, x-ray diffraction methods and tem. the different results obtained suggested the appearance of silver nanoparticles (snps) as determined by the process parameters with a particle size of 12.4 nm. the sample was further screened against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli using gentamicin as control. from the results, there is evidence of inhibition towards bacteria growth. it can now be inferred from the studies that biosynthesis of nanoparticles could be a gateway to our numerous health issues.

TI  == autocatalytic growth of biofunctionalized antibacterial silver nanoparticles.
AB  == development of eco-friendly processes for nanosynthesis is gaining importance owing to the widespread application of nanoparticles (nps). in the present study, we have explained the mechanism and kinetics of bioreduction in the biosynthesis  of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using aqueous leaf extract of rhizophora apiculata. spectrophotometric methods were employed to quantify the bioactive molecules present before and after the reduction process. the results showed that the polyphenols were the main components responsible for the biosynthesis of agnps, which was further confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the kinetics of formation of agnps were monitored by time-resolved spectrophotometric and x-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that the np formation is an autocatalytic process with a rate constant of 1.9 x 10(-2) min(-1) . the nps were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques like ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. the biogenic agnps showed substantial inhibitory activity to proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus with minimum  inhibitory concentration values of 2.5, 12.5, 2.5, and 31.25 mug/ml, respectively. the current research provides an insight into the mechanistic aspects of bioreduction and formation of agnps.

AB  == here, we report the characterization of three avian beta-defensins (avbds) from the goose, named anser_avbd1, avbd3, and avbd6, respectively. all of anser_avbds  exhibited broad antibacterial activity. in addition, the antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis decreased significantly in the presence of 100mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. in order to assess the significance of these anser_avbds in the infection of salmonella enteritidis, mrna expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 and anser_avbds in tissues of both control and infected geese was evaluated. we observed a significant up-regulation of tlr4, anser_avbd1, 3, and 6 in some immune tissues evaluated, in response to s. enteritidis infection. these  data demonstrated that tlr4 may serve a possible role in eliciting host immune responses to pathogens, and beta-defensins may play a pivotal role in the host defense mechanisms of the goose.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and phytochemical constituents of leaf extracts of cassia  auriculata.
AB  == plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'for centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. in the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). the aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). the extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. the antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from cassia auriculata.

TI  == convenient syntheses of cyanuric chloride-derived nhc ligands, their ag(i) and au(i) complexes and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == convenient syntheses of mono- and bis-imidazolium 1,3,5-triazine derivatives bearing piperidine and morpholine substituents are reported. in situ deprotonation of the mono-imidazolium salts and reaction with ag2o or au(tht)cl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) precursors affords the corresponding ag(nhc)cl and au(nhc)cl carbene complexes. in the presence of ag(i) or au(i) salts the bis-imidazolium pincers eliminate the imidazolium group to afford -ome or -nme2 substituted triazines depending on the solvent used. in solution, the ag(i) and au(i) complexes show a barrier to rotation about the ctriazine-namine bonds, with calculated deltag( not equal) barriers in the region of 70 kj mol(-1). single crystal x-ray structures of several of the proligands and their corresponding ag(i) and au(i) complexes were obtained. these universally reveal an extended, rigidly planar pi-conjugated network between the triazine core, imidazolium/imidazolylidene substituents and exocyclic amine functions, to which  the origin of the rotational barrier observed in solution is attributed. only very weak ntriazine-metal interactions are observed in the solid state, as indicated by small deviations of the cnhc-ag-cl bond angles from 180 degrees and  also supported by dft calculations on the ag(nhc)cl complex (nhc = 4,6-dipiperidinyl-2-methylimidazolylidene triazine). preliminary antimicrobial susceptibility studies against five microorganisms (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus nctc 13277, s. aureus nctc 6571, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662, proteus mirabilis nctc 11938 and candida albicans atcc 90028) show that the above triazine-based ag-nhc complexes are active antimicrobial and antifungal agents.

TI  == microorganisms' colonization and their antibiotic resistance pattern in oro - tracheal tube.
AB  == background and objectives: recently, nosocomial infections have been discussed as a critical issue among intubated patients leading to significant morbidity and mortality. hence, the pattern of microbiological colonization and antibiotic resistance are much valuable in this regard. we aimed to investigate the pattern  of microorganism colonization and antibiotic resistance in patients with endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to propose a proper empirical antibiotic therapy in this setting. materials and methods: this cross sectional study was conducted among 880 patients admitted in imam khomeini hospital between 2008 and  2011 who were subsequently intubated or underwent tracheostomy due to insufficient self ventilation. samples for microbiological cultures were obtained after extubation and then sent to the central laboratory for further assessment.  antibiograms and microbiological cultures were obtained for each sample. results: of 880 patients enrolled in this study, 531 (60.3%) were male and 349 (39.7%) were female. nineteen different organisms were isolated including acinetobacter (213, 24.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (147, 16.7%), staphylococcus aureus (106, 12%), proteus mirabilis (90, 10.2%), and other organisms (324, 36.8%). antibiotic resistance was mainly seen in acinetobacter (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidim, cefepim,  and penicillin), s. aureus (imipenem) and klebsiella (pipracillintazobactam and ampicillin-sulbactam). conclusion: this study represents the most common microorganisms colonizing tracheal tube of hospitalized patients and their pattern of antibiotic resistance. acinetobacter was the most common microorganism isolated from endotracheal tube. hence, it may be possible to initiate the empiric antibiotic treatment before the results of culture are become available.  ciprofloxacin was also the most prevalent antibiotic revealing resistant pattern. moreover, most of the microorganisms were sensitive to imipenem and pipracillin-tazobactam.

TI  == chronic otorrhoea: spectrum of microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivity in a south african cohort.
AB  == background: chronic otorrhoea is difficult to treat, with treatment in south africa (sa) being protocol driven and generally initiated at the primary healthcare level. there is a lack of local studies that focus on the bacteriology and antimicrobial sensitivities of chronic otorrhoea, which underpins the management advice offered. aims: to determine the microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility of patients with chronic otorrhoea and the validity  of the department of health's (doh) current guideline. methods: we conducted a prospective study at groote schuur hospital from 2005 to 2009. we included patients with chronic otorrhoea classified as either otitis media or otitis externa, according to our definitions. pus swabs were taken, from which microorganisms were cultured and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. results: of 79 patients with otorrhoea, 50 had otitis media, 21 had otitis externa and the condition was not determined in 8 patients. the most common organism isolated with otitis media was proteus mirabilis (18/50; 36%) and with otitis externa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (7/21; 33%). otorrhoea had a different microbial spectrum compared with international reports, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection in a single patient. the organisms isolated were susceptible mainly to fluoroquinolones (96%) and aminoglycosides (81%). conclusion: amoxicillin is a poor choice of antibiotic due to its low sensitivity, which calls into question the current doh guideline for otorrhoea. antimicrobial treatment protocols should be based on local data and be revisited from time to time. this study suggests that, should first-line treatment fail, an antibiotic with gram-negative cover, e.g. a topical fluoroquinolone, should be considered.

TI  == hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  == hydramacin-1 (hm1) from the metazoan hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. notably, hm1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. to date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of hm1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. the high binding constants of hm1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain swt(k/r) motifs. the residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 a and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by hm1 was observed for a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.

TI  == effects of different substituents on the crystal structures and antimicrobial activities of six ag(i) quinoline compounds.
AB  == the syntheses and single crystal x-ray structures of [ag(5-nitroquinoline)2]no3 (1), [ag(8-nitroquinoline)2]no3.h2o (2), [ag(6-methoxy-8-nitroquinoline)(no3)]n (3), [ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)(no3)]n (4), [ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)2]no3 (5), and [ag(6-quinolinecarboxylic acid)2]no3 (6) are described. as an alternative to solution chemistry, solid-state grinding could be used to prepare  compounds 1 and 3, but the preparation of 4 and 5 in this way failed. the ag(i) ions in the monomeric compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 are coordinated to two ligands via the nitrogen atoms of the quinoline rings, thereby forming a distorted linear coordination geometry with ag-n bond distances of 2.142(2)-2.336(2) a and n-ag-n  bond angles of 163.62(13) degrees -172.25(13) degrees . the 1d coordination polymers 3 and 4 contain ag(i) centers coordinating one ligand and two bridging nitrate groups, thereby forming a distorted trigonal planar coordination geometry with ag-n bond distances of 2.2700(14) and 2.224(5) a, ag-o bond distances of 2.261(4)-2.536(5) a, and n-ag-o bond angles of 115.23(5) degrees -155.56(5) degrees . hirshfeld surface analyses of compounds 1-6 are presented as d(norm) and curvedness maps. the d(norm) maps show different interaction sites around the ag(i) ions, i.e., ag...ag interactions and possible o-h...o, c-h...o, c-h...n, and c-h...c hydrogen bonds. curvedness maps are a good way of visualizing pi-pi stacking interactions between molecules. the antimicrobial activities of compounds 1, 2, and 6 were screened against 15 different multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and compared to the antimicrobial activities of the clinically used silver sulfadiazine (ss). compound 2 showed activity similar to ss against this set of test organisms, being active against all strains and having slightly better average silver efficiency than ss (5 vs 6 mug ag/ml). against the standard nonresistant bacterial strains of staphylococcus aureus , pseudomonas aeruginosa , proteus mirabilis , and streptococcus pyogenes , compound 1 performed better than silver  nitrate, with an average mic of 6 mug ag/ml versus 18 mug ag/ml for the reference agno3. electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) analyses of compounds 3 and 6 in dmso/meoh confirm the two-coordinated ag(+) complexes in solution, and the results of the (1)h nmr titrations of dmso solutions of 5-nitroquinoline and  8-nitroquinoline with agno3 in dmso suggest that 5-nitroquinoline is more strongly coordinated to the silver ion.

TI  == study of photodynamic therapy in the control of isolated microorganisms from infected wounds--an in vitro study.
AB  == the effective treatment of infected wounds continues to be a serious challenge, mainly due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. photodynamic therapy (pdt) refers to the topical or systemic administration of a non-toxic, photosensitizing agent (ps), followed by irradiation with visible light of a suitable wavelength. the possibility of applying the pdt locally is what makes it so favorable to the treatment of infected wounds. the goal of this study was to evaluate the action of the pdt in the inactivation in vitro of microorganisms coming from infected wounds, using methylene blue (mb) and photodithazine (pdz) as the ps and comparing the efficacy of these two compounds for pdt on bacteria.  for the application of pdt, isolated microorganisms identified from material collected from wounds were suspended in a saline solution containing 10(6) viable cells/ml. each isolated microorganism was submitted to pdt with mb and with pdz in accordance with the following treatment groups: n/t--no treatment; t1--pdt with pdz; t2--pdt with mb; t3--irradiation without ps; t4--treatment with pdz without light; and t5--treatment with mb without light. as a light source, an led-based device was used (biopdi/irrad-lead 660), composed of 54 leds, each with 70 mw of power in the 660 nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum. each tray of 96 wells was irradiated with an intensity of 25 mw/cm(2) and a dose of light of 50 j/cm(3) for 33 min. all the tests were made in duplicate. it was then concluded that the pdt with pdz was capable of inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria samples, however it did not have the same effect on gram-negative bacteria, which showed growth greater than 100,000 cfu; the pdt with mb showed an effectiveness on gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, for it was able to inhibit bacterial growth in both cases.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial and allelopathic activity of tunisian conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker essential oils.
AB  == conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker (asteraceae) is a spontaneous annual herb, fairly widespread throughout tunisia, which has rarely been studied or valued in  any sector. essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts  (flower heads, leaves, stems, and roots) of c. sumatrensis plants, which were collected in autumn (november 2007) at the flowering stage in the area of monastir, tunisia. in total, 98 compounds, representing 88.1-99.3% of the oil composition, were identified by gc-fid and gc/ms analyses. the root essential oil was distinguished by its high content in acetylenes (matricaria ester, 4; 74.3%), while those from flower heads and leaves were dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (61.1 and 50.3%, resp.). the oils of c. sumatrensis from tunisia belonged to a matricaria ester/caryophyllene oxide chemotype. all the oils were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, and allelopathic activities. the results indicate that the leaf oil exhibited significant in vitro antibacterial activity  against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and proteus mirabilis and that the c. sumatrensis oils isolated from the aerial parts presented high mycelia-growth inhibition of candida albicans and the filamentous fungi tested. moreover, the essential oils of the different plant parts inhibited the shoot and root growth of raphanus sativus (radish) seedlings. indeed, the inhibition of the hypocotyl growth varied from 28.6 to 90.1% and that of the radicle from 42.3 to 96.2%.

TI  == microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in central alabama.
AB  == urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. they are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. the purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in central alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. this was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their  antibiotic resistance profile at this central alabama hospital. the survey period was between july 2009 and june 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed  and susceptibility testing was determined using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method. the results indicated that escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.8%), enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3.0%),  klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter freundii (1.5%), morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). for the 215 e. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, p < 0.05). in contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, p < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this central alabama hospital. additionally, this study found that e. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (lee et al. 2010; rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. it is imperative to monitor the resistance of p. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

AB  == few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. copper(ii) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but not staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis or escherichia coli. attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, s. aureus and e. coli, with iron(ii) sulphate, iron(iii) chloride, and vitamin c, showed that iron(ii) enhanced (+)-catechin against s. aureus, but not e. coli; neither iron(iii) nor combined iron(ii) and copper(ii), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. vitamin c enhanced copper(ii) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(ii). catalase or edta added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced h(2)o(2)via the action of added metal(ii) ions. h(2)o(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(ii) mixtures and copper(ii) alone could account for the  principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as  well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(ii) against s. aureus. these novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(ii) or iron(ii) contents in certain crop protection and other products.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  == abstract. a method, based on raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed.  spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (gram-negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, and gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a raman spectrometer with a fiber raman probe (830 nm). colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for raman measurements. after preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and mahalanobis distance (pca/md) discrimination algorithm. we found that the mean raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and s. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. pca/md could discriminate gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.

TI  == the effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  == polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. an in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using usp <51> methodology. growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except aspergillus  brasiliensis. a range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following  micro-organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, candida albicans, s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, and e. faecalis. for a. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. the results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity  in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.

TI  == impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  == objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin,  amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was  significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.

TI  == emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative clinical isolates.
AB  == fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are considered as first line drugs to treat infectious diseases. in order to find out useful fluoroquinolones, the antibiotic resistance of fluoroquinolones, namely, ofloxacin (ofl), ciprofloxacin (cip), norfloxacin (nrf), enoxacin (enx), pefloxacin (pfl) and levofloxacin (lvf) was investigated against ninety five clinical isolates that includes staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. in vitro activity of these isolates was carried out by agar dilution method. all staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to ofl at 2 mug/ml. about 6% isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be resistance to lvf and enx, 6% to cip, ofl and pfl and none of the isolates were resistant to lvf and enx. percentage resistance of p. aeruginosa was found to be 4.35% to cip, 7% to ofl and 2.2% to nrf, whereas 8.69% to enx, 0% to pfl and 17.4% to lvf, respectively. the present study provides the data about the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative bacteria and strongly recommends the rational and appropriate use of these antibiotics.

TI  == membrane interaction and secondary structure of de novo designed arginine-and tryptophan peptides with dual function.
AB  == cell-penetrating peptides and antimicrobial peptides are two classes of positively charged membrane active peptides with several properties in common. the challenge is to combine knowledge about the membrane interaction mechanisms and structural properties of the two classes to design peptides with membrane-specific actions, useful either as transporters of cargo or as antibacterial substances. membrane active peptides are commonly rich in arginine  and tryptophan. we have previously designed a series of arg/trp peptides and investigated how the position and number of tryptophans affect cellular uptake. here we explore the antimicrobial properties and the interaction with lipid model membranes of these peptides, using minimal inhibitory concentrations assay (mic), circular dichroism (cd) and linear dichroism (ld). the results show that the arg/trp peptides inhibit the growth of the two gram positive strains staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus pyogenes, with some individual variations depending on the position of the tryptophans. no inhibition of the gram negative strains proteus mirabilis or pseudomonas aeruginosa was noticed. cd indicated that when bound to lipid vesicles one of the peptides forms an alpha-helical like structure, whereas the other five exhibited rather random coiled structures. ld indicated that all six peptides were somehow aligned parallel with the membrane surface. our results do not reveal any obvious connection between membrane interaction and antimicrobial effect for the studied  peptides. by contrast cell-penetrating properties can be coupled to both the secondary structure and the degree of order of the peptides.

TI  == effects of sequential infections of caenorhabditis elegans with staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans can be used to study the dynamics of polymicrobial infections, specifically those between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  with c. elegans, proteus mirabilis acts as an opportunistic pathogen and does not kill this host. hence, in the present study, c. elegans was immunochallenged by pre-infecting it with the pathogen staphylococcus aureus in order to study the subsequent effect of p. mirabilis on the host. it was found that 12 hrs of s. aureus and 80 hrs of subsequent p. mirabilis infection significantly reduced the  life span of exposed c. elegans by 80%. however, preinfection with s. aureus for  8 and 4 hrs reduced the life span of c. elegans by only 60 and 30%, respectively. further, there was greater production of reactive oxygen species in the sequentially infected samples than in the s. aureus and p. mirabilis controls. real time pcr analysis indicated regulation of candidate immune regulatory genes, lysozyme (lys-7), cub-like proteins (f08g5.6), neuropeptide-like factors (nlp-29), transcription factors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (atf-7) and daf-2-daf-16 (daf-16), insulin-like signaling pathways and c-type lectin (clec-60 and clec-87) family members during s. aureus and subsequent p. mirabilis-mediated infections, indicating possible roles of, and contributions by, the above factors during host immune responses against these sequential infections. the present findings demonstrate that s. aureus infections increase the vulnerability of the  c. elegans host by subverting its immune system, which then permits the opportunistic pathogen p. mirabilis to be pathogenic to this host.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == the effect of plum juice on the prevention of struvite calculus formation in vitro.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the effect of plum juice on struvite calculus formation in vitro and to explore the effect of plum juice on urease-producing bacteria and urease activity. the compliance of available drugs is low for struvite calculus after surgical treatment and functional food may represent a good choice as an alternative therapy. materials and methods: antibacterial activity was assessed using a microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test. urease activity was determined by measuring ammonia production. struvite crystals were induced by proteus mirabilis in artificial urine with natural and ph-adjusted plum juice. the optical density (od)(600) and ph of artificial urine were examined, as well the shape and weights of crystals. results: natural plum juice showed an antibacterial effect on urease-producing bacteria, whereas the ph-adjusted juice  did not. a concentration-dependent inhibition on urease activity was found for both natural and ph-adjusted juice. natural plum juice at a high concentration of 0.5% showed an obvious inhibition on the increase of od(600) and ph of the artificial urine, and crystal formation was prevented by up to or more than 8 h,  depending on the concentration of juice. crystal weight in the natural plum juice groups was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. the ph-adjusted plum juice did not show any effect on od(600) and ph, although the presence of juice changed the crystal habit, indicating that the juice slowed the growth rate of crystals. conclusions: natural plum juice at high and moderate concentrations prevented the formation of p. mirabilis-induced crystals for up to 8 h in artificial urine. although ph-adjusted and low-concentration natural juice did not prevent the occurrence of crystals, both types of juice slowed their growth rate.

TI  == standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  == purpose: isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (utp). however, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. an important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. in this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common utp. methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (muw = muj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, and  staphylococcus aureus. result: bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 cfu. the gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. the growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for e. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for e. faecalis,  1.31 +/- 0.04 for p. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for s. aureus. the shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of utp in artificial urine. clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen  differentiation. utp detection after only 4 h is realistic. the rapid detection of utp tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of imc and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.

TI  == spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  == microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. however, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in china. we  conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (ni) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from january 2003 to december 2010. we studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. the number of nis per 100 admissions was 10.9. the commonest isolates were pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and candida (11.4%). the result indicated that the numbers of patients with acinetobacter sp. infection increased (p=0.004), but with proteus mirabilis infection decreased (p=0.004). the isolated acinetobacter sp. and p. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost  all antibiotics tested. notably, more frequent acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the p. aeruginosa and e. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. the increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == type i and type ii mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (ps) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ros), such as singlet oxygen ((1) o(2), produced via type ii mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (ho(.), produced via type i mechanism). this study examined the relative contributions of (1) o(2) and ho(.)  to apdt killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. study design/materials and methods: fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (sosg) were used to determine ho(.) and (1) o(2) produced by illumination of two  ps: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (bb6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (pei-ce6). dimethylthiourea is a ho(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (nan(3)) is a quencher of (1) o(2). both apdt and killing by fenton reaction (chemical generation of ho(.)) were carried out on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). results: conjugate pei-ce6 mainly produced (1) o(2) (quenched by nan(3)), while bb6 produced ho(.) in addition to (1) o(2) when nan(3) potentiated probe activation. nan(3) also potentiated hpf activation by fenton reagent. all bacteria were killed by fenton reagent but gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than gram-negatives. nan(3) potentiated fenton-mediated killing of  all bacteria. the ratio of apdt killing between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for bb6 and 25:1 for conjugate pei-ce6. there was a nan(3)  dose-dependent inhibition of apdt killing using both pei-ce6 and bb6 against gram-negative bacteria while nan(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: azidyl radicals may be formed from nan(3) and ho(.). it may be that gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to ho(.) while  gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) o(2). the differences in nan(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of ps binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of nan(3) into cell walls of bacteria.

AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == microbiological and mucociliary properties of the ethanol extract of hymenocardia acida on selected respiratory clinical isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial property of the ethanol leaf extract of hymenocardia acida (h.  acida) on some opportunistic respiratory pathogens was evaluated in this study. we also assessed the activity of the extract on tracheal mucociliary activity using murine tracheal mucus exudation and mucociliary motility in pigeons as experimental models. phytochemical screening of the extract was done; and acute toxicity of the extract in mice was carried out using lorke's method for estimation of its median lethal dose. results show the presence of carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, and balsams in the extract and  the absence of anthraquinones, terpenes, and sterols. results of the acute toxicity test showed that the extract was slightly toxic, with an estimated median lethal dose of 1,767.77 mg/kg body weight. at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body  weight of h. acida, tracheal mucus exudation was increased by 14.29, 19.24, and 33.82%, respectively. the effect on mucociliary velocity was dose-dependent as 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of the extract led to increased ciliary activity by 7.69, 61.5, and 81.6%, respectively. the effects of the extract (200  mg/kg body weight) on mucus exudation and clearance were significant (p < .05) and higher than the effect of ammonium chloride. although the extract did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans and k. pneumoniae, it exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. these findings show the mucociliary activity and antimicrobial properties of h. acida ethanol extract, and justify its use in the treatment of airway disorders.

TI  == microbiological aspects of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the vaginal introitus microbial flora in girls with and without symptoms of vulvovaginitis, and to present the distribution of isolated microorganisms by age groups in girls with vulvovaginitis. we enrolled 500 girls with vulvovaginitis symptoms, aged 2-12 years, referred by their pediatricians for microbiological examination of the vaginal introitus swabs, and 30 age-matched asymptomatic girls. similar microbial flora was isolated in both groups, but the symptomatic girls had significantly more common positive microbiological findings compared to controls (p < 0.001). in symptomatic girls,  the following pathogenic bacteria were isolated: streptococcus pyogenes (4.2%), haemophilus influenzae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (5.8%). bacteria of fecal origin were found in vaginal introitus swabs in 33.8% of cases, most commonly proteus mirabilis (14.4%), enterococcus faecalis (12.2%), and escherichia coli (7.0%). the finding of fecal flora was more common compared to controls, reaching a statistical significance (p < 0.05), as well as in girls aged up to 6 years (p < 0.001). candida species were found in 2.4% of girls with  vulvovaginitis symptoms. conclusion: the microbial ecosystem in girls with clinical signs of vulvovaginitis is complex and variable, and the presence of a microorganism does not necessarily imply that it is the cause of infection. the diagnosis of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls requires a complex and comprehensive approach, and microbiological findings should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings.

TI  == antimicrobial activities against biofilm formed by proteus mirabilis isolates from wound and urinary tract infections.
AB  == background: bacterial species are capable of living as biofilm and/or planktonic  forms. there is increasing evidence for the role of bacterial biofilm in various  wound and urinary tract infections (utis). the aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the bacteria, isolated from urinary tract infections (utis) and wound infections, to form biofilm and correlate the role of biofilm with their antimicrobial resistance. materials and methods: all the isolated bacteria were screened for their ability to form biofilm using the microtitre plate method. results: wound isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacter sp. had more biofilm forming capacity than the uti isolates. proteus mirabilis isolates were among the strongest biofilm forming bacteria and were chosen for antimicrobial study. in sub-mic concentrations of antimicrobial agents used, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most effective in decreasing biofilm formation. on the other hand, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were effective in partial removal of preformed biofilm biomass. conclusion: ciprofloxacin was more effective in killing bacterial cells especially at high antimicrobial concentrations that could be reached in urine levels and can be used in impregenating catheters.

TI  == rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  == what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. in addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. the study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for  diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. objective: to investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. imc is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. patients and methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (microw = microj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. results: bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. the detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml for e. coli, 10 cfu/ml for p. mirabilis and e. faecalis and 10(3) cfu/ml for s. aureus. the total heat was highest in p. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 j, followed by e. coli (3-4 j), s. aureus (2-3 j) and e. faecalis (1.3-1.5 j). the shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) cfu/ml),  imc may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.

TI  == [epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases of iasi, romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  == infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. the aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. material and methods: a retrospective study was conducted between january 2008 and december 2010 at the clinical hospital of infectious diseases iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. results: from 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). there were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated,  being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative staphylococci (14/18,66%), enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group b streptococcus (3/4%), streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp., salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), aerococcus viridans, streptococcus equi, klebsiella pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, sphyngomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of s. aureus. among 16 invazive strains of e. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. there were no e.  coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. the mean mortality rate was 14,66%. conclusions: the high level of resistance of s. aureus and e. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.

TI  == post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  == salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. the purpose of this study was to analyse infections in  our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (ap). a retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (sl) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. the antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. infection was defined by tabet and johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cn stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin  levels <3.2 g/l (p = 0.012). there was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low bmis. the most common organisms  isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus mrsa (43%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis (7% each). all these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. pseudomonas and serratia were  not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. the current antibiotic regime following sl is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. it would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of ap for patients undergoing sl that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. in addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. other aspects of surgical management should be also  taken in consideration.

(11 mm) while the benzene extracts of h. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and s. aureus (12 mm). conclusions: it is  hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria.
AB  == purpose: sperm immobilization factor isolated from staphylococcus aureus immobilizes human spermatozoa as well as motile bacteria, showing that sperm immobilization factor receptor might be shared by bacteria and human spermatozoa. thus, we sought to identify a common sperm immobilization factor binding receptor on spermatozoa and bacteria. materials and methods: sperm immobilization factor was isolated from s. aureus. sperm immobilization factor binding receptors were isolated from spermatozoa and bacteria. results: antisperm antibodies in humans cross-reacted with bacteria antibodies. thus, molecular similarities between determinants of spermatozoa and pathogenic microorganisms can be inferred. sperm  immobilization factor isolated from s. aureus immobilized spermatozoa (150 mug/ml) and motile bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis (500 mug/ml). this showed the presence of a common sperm immobilization factor binding conformation on spermatozoa and bacteria. furthermore, receptors binding sperm immobilization factor were extracted and purified from spermatozoa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria was confirmed by observing the blockage  of spermatozoa immobilization by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of receptors isolated from spermatozoa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa or p. mirabilis. also, a higher concentration of sperm immobilization factor (200 mug/ml) caused sperm death. blocking the death of spermatozoa induced by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of these receptors provided further evidence for a common  receptor. conclusions: results provide evidence for molecular similarity between  bacteria and spermatozoa.

AB  == chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn  model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p  = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.

TI  == identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in lebanese patients.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. we conducted a study of 32 lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. the presence or absence of s aureus enterotoxin a, b, c, and d (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. a total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. of these, only 3 (8.8%) were s aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin b). moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. our results could not confirm that s aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the lebanese group studied.

TI  == potential use of 68ga-apo-transferrin as a pet imaging agent for detecting staphylococcus aureus infection.
AB  == introduction: (67)ga citrate has been extensively used to detect infection and inflammation since 1971. however, its clinical utility is compromised due to several limitations. the present project explored whether (68)ga-apo-transferrin  ((68)ga-tf), when prepared in vitro, is a useful agent for positron emission tomography (pet) imaging of bacterial infection. methods: an infection was induced in male wistar rats by injecting 5 x 10(5) cfu units of staphyococcus aureus in the right thigh muscle. (68)ga-tf was synthesized by mixing (68)gacl(3) with apo-transferrin (tf, 2 mg) in sodium carbonate (0.1 m, ph 7.0) and incubating at 40 degrees c for 1 h. animals were injected with 10-15 mbq of (68)ga-tf containing approximately 0.2 mg tf and imaged at different time intervals using siemens biograph pet-ct. results: when (68)ga-tf were injected in the infected rats, the infection lesion was detectable within 20 min post injection. the biodistribution showed the uptake at the lesion increased with time as shown by significantly increased standard uptake values for up to 4 h post injection. there was a considerable decrease in the background activity during the same period of study, giving higher target-to-muscle ratios. blood pool activity at 3 h post injection was insignificant. (68)gacl(3) (when not conjugated to tf) did not localize at the infection lesion up to 120 min post injection. conclusion: the preliminary results suggest that (68)ga-tf is capable  of detecting s. aureus infection in the rat model, within an hour after intravenous injection.

TI  == phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala (asteraceae).
AB  == some vernonia species (vernonia ambigua, vernonia blumeoides and vernonia oocephala) used in northern nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. the antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the nccls was carried out on klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysentriae, proteus mirabilis  and pseudomonas fluorescence. the results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the vernonia species being studied.  the activity of chloroform fraction of v. blumeoides was higher on c. ulcerans and k. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of v. oocephala and v.  ambigua were more active on p. mirabilis (27 mm) and s. typhi (22 mm), respectively. it is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against mrsa. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/ml for all the organisms tested. the mic of 1.25 mg/ml exhibited by the chloroform fractions on  both gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the  vernonia species being studied. phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. the antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. the overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. this lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.

TI  == urine cultures from indwelling bladder catheters in nursing home patients: a point prevalence study in a swedish county.
AB  == objectives: to survey the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance in urinary strains from patients with indwelling bladder catheters residing in nursing homes within a geographically defined region. material and methods: urine was sampled for culture from 163 catheter patients (126 men and 37 women) during a 2 week period in march 2010. susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was compared with all urinary strains (n = 9994) from hospitals and primary healthcare in the same geographical area cultured during the first 6 months of 2010 (control group). results: bacteriuria was found in 159 of 163 urine samples  (98%). enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli were the most common species, one or both being detected in 72% of the urine samples, while proteus species were found in10% and a single isolate of providentia species was seen.strains in  the study patients were more resistant to antibiotics than in the control group.  particularly large differences were noted for ciprofloxacinin in e. coli (16.9% vs 7.9%) and for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in e. faecalis (39.1% vs 24.8%). one extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli was cultured (1.3%), compared with 1.6% in the control group. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were detected. conclusions: proteus mirabilis and providentia species were rarely isolated, in sharp contrast to previous studies from geriatric hospital wards where they have often been in the majority. the limited incidence of esbl and the absence of vre and mrsa is gratifying, but the high resistance to antibiotics needs to be assessed on a continuous basis.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility pattern of urinary tract pathogens in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == urinary tract infections (uti) affect all age groups and occur in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals and have serious impact on the socioeconomic life of the individual and the society, and also account for a large proportion of antibacterial drug consumption. treatment failure has been attributed to increasing resistance to common antibiotics, but there is paucity of data from this part of nigeria. this prospective study was carried out to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of uropathogens in ibadan using standard microbiological diagnostic methods. statistical analysis was by simple percentages among related variables. four hundred and nine urinary  isolates, 239 (58.4%) and 170 (41.6%) from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients respectively were studied. frequency of occurrence of urinary pathogens  were klebsiella spp 171 (41.8%), pseudomonas species (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) 81 (19.8%), escherichia coli 78 (19.1%), staphylococcus aureus 31 (7.6%) and proteus mirabilis 31 (7.6%). resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin 97%, tetracycline 93%, cotrimoxazole 98%, and amoxycillin 89%  was observed among most uropathogens. seventy-five to 100% pseudomonas spp. were  resistant to the common antibiotics and also 87.1% and 82.4% were resistant to nalidixic acid and cefuroxime respectively. however, appreciable susceptibility by all uropathogens was found with amikacin 75%, ciprofloxacin 72.2%, ceftriaxone 68.4%, and pefloxacin 64.9%. isolates from the community showed more susceptibility to tested drugs. in conclusion, widespread resistance to most antibiotics including cephalosporins and quinolones was found among all uropathogens.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide a3-apo in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

TI  == synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the synergistic activity between nitric oxide (no) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (proli/no) and silver(i) sulfadiazine (agsd) was evaluated against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. the combination of no and agsd was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) was calculated to be <0.5. gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the gram-positive bacteria, while gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. the in vitro synergistic activity of agsd and no observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.

TI  == prevalence of bacteria and parasites in white ibis in egypt.
AB  == a field survey was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial infections among free-living white ibis (nipponia nippon) in which 92 bacterial isolates were recovered from 193 different internal organs of 55 apparently healthy ibis.  escherichia coli and salmonella spp. were isolated at rates of 43.6% and 14.5%, respectively. the other bacterial pathogens isolated were shigella spp. (34.5%),  enterobacter spp. (21.8%) citrobacter spp. (18.1%), klebsiella pneumonia (16.3),  staphylococcus aureus (10.9%) and proteus mirabilis (7.2%). the antibiogram indicated that all isolates were highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, trimethoprim and penicillin. penicillin was most effective against s. aureus. an  examination of the gastrointestinal tract revealed the presence of a nematode, ascaris (porroceacum ensicaudatum), and three trematodes (echinochasmus perfoliatus, apatemon aracilis and patagifer bilobus). other trematodes were detected in enlarged gall bladder and kidney lesions. histopathological examination showed signs of hepatitis. the gall bladder had cholangitis, cholicystitis which may have been caused by trematode infestation. the kidneys also showed multiple parasitic cysts of trematodes and non-suppurative interstitial nephritis. this study suggests the possible role of the white ibis,  when living near poultry populations, in transmitting certain pathogens to poultry.

TI  == bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c.
AB  == this study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. in experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees c and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. from the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, and staphylococcus aureus species. these 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. all contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. in samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. in experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria  were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c. semen with e.  coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. this reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with e.  cloacae and p. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (s. epidermidis and s. aureus). in conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.

TI  == identification and characterization of a phospholipase a2 from the venom of the saw-scaled viper: novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  == phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. in this study, a basic myotoxic pla(2), named ectx-i was isolated from echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on superdex g-75, and reverse phase hplc on c18 and c8 sepharose columns. pla(2), ectx-i was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by maldi-tof  (15 kd by sds-page), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. the n-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic pla(2)s from other snake venoms. the purified pla(2) ectx-i was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw&tes), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. ectx-i showed strong antibacterial activity against b. pseudomallei (khw) and e. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. however,  the gram-positive bacterium e. aerogenes failed to show any effect on ectx-i protein at tested doses. the most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of ectx-i was observed at mics of >15 mug/ml against (b. pseudomallei, khw) and mics >30 mug/ml against e. aerogenes. mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. ectx-i was able to induce cytotoxicity on thp-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in balb/c mice. ectx-i also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. it is shown that the toxic effect induced by e. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic pla(2) (ectx-i). the result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. in conclusion, ectx-i displays a heparin binding c-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  == aim: bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (vlus) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically  infected ulcers is unknown. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of vlus by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. methods: the ulcers of 178 patients were sampled  weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology  standardised to ensure data reproducibility. results: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. the species most frequently found were staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), finegoldia magna (21.4%) and proteus mirabilis (16.1%). no single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. the presence of c striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. conclusion: routine bacteriological culture analysis of the vlu wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. however, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. the presence of c striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing vlu by normal skin flora.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

AB  == increasing antibiotic resistance has prompted a search for new compounds with anti-microbial activity. in the authors' previous study, oregano extract was identified as one of the most potent anti-microbial compounds. the disk diffusion method was employed to assess the degree of inhibition against various microorganisms, and the bacteriostatic or bactericidal mechanism of action. disk  diffusion studies showed that oregano was found to be bacteriostatic for staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, (mrsa) but bacteriocidal for seven other microorganisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa could not be inhibited by oregano. an ointment consisting of 1-10% oregano could inhibit most  organisms except for proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris, which required 20% and pseudomonas which could not be inhibited even at the highest concentration of 80%. oregano extracts can be formulated into an ointment that shows broad antimicrobial activity. additional testing to assess tissue toxicity and other adverse reactions would be needed prior to human testing.

TI  == an assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using lucilia sericata meigen as the marker species.
AB  == the relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (es) from two carrion-feeding insects, calliphora vicina robineau-desvoidy and dermestes maculatus degeer, and a detritivore, tenebrio molitor linnaeus, were compared to  that of lucilia sericata meigen, a species with es of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. viable counts were used to assess time-kill of es against five bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although t. molitor and d. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of p. mirabilis. the blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the larval es from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of  potency varied between the four species. these differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using l. sericata.

TI  == bacterial colonization of chronic leg ulcers: current results compared with data  5 years ago in a specialized dermatology department.
AB  == background: in nearly every chronic wound different bacteria species can be detected. nevertheless, the presence of such microorganisms is not necessarily obligatory associated with a delayed wound healing. but from this initially unproblematic colonization an infection up to a sepsis can arise in some patients. the aim of our clinical investigation was to analyse the spectrum of microbial colonization of patients with a chronic leg ulcer in our specialized dermatological outpatient wound clinic, and to compare them with the results of comparable data already collected 5 years ago. objectives: in our retrospective investigation the results of bacteriological swabs were documented in 100 patients with a total of 107 chronic leg ulcers. all patients visited the specialized wound outpatient clinic, department of dermatology, university of essen in germany. methods: a total of 60 patients were female, 40 were male. the  mean age was 65 years. altogether a total of 191 bacterial isolates and 25 different bacterial species could be identified. results: the most often detected species were staphylococcus aureus (n = 60), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 36) as well as proteus mirabilis (n = 17). in 10 patients (10%) we identified a colonization with methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa). merely in 6 patients the taken swabs were sterile. five years ago a comparable investigation was already carried out in our wound outpatient clinic. at that time we could detect  in particular more frequent mrsa (21.5% vs. 10%) and rarely p. aeruginosa (24.1%  vs. 33.6%). conclusion: the results of our investigation demonstrate the current  spectrum of the bacterial colonization in patients with chronic leg ulcers in a university dermatological wound centre in comparison to the last 5 years. in our  institution we were able to demonstrate a shift of the detected bacterial species from gram-positive in direction to gram-negative germs. beside the already known  problems with mrsa, in future therapeutic strategies in patients with chronic leg ulcers the increasing amount of gram-negative bacteria and especially of p. aeruginosa should considered.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and tris-edta.
AB  == minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and tris-edta (otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated  with canine otitis. the microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. the most susceptible group included  staphylococcus pseudintermedius, malassezia pachydermatis, streptococcus canis and corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (mbc = 23/0.8 microg/ml of chlorhexidine/tris-edta). the most resistant organism was proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (mbc = 375/12 microg/ml). escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate mbcs ranging between  188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/ml. interestingly, s. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than s. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. although the concentrations required for killing (mbcs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and  tris-edta was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.

(lamiaceae), used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments such as urinary tract, wound, skin and gastrointestinal infections, was evaluated for its antibacterial properties against four clinical bacteria isolates namely:  escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa and the antifungal properties using a clinical isolate of candida albicans. a typed bacterium of escherichia coli atcc 11775 and another typed fungal strain of candida albicans (atcc 90028) were also included. the study also intended to verify if the concomitant administration of conventional antibiotics  with ocimium gratisimum which is normally taken as food (spice) will negatively affect its activity. methods: the agar diffusion method was used to test the in vitro activity of the plant extract. the interaction of the plant extract with some disc antibiotics namely: ciprofloxacin, septrin, streptomycin, ampicillin, nystatin and ketoconazole was tested using the agar overlay inoculum susceptibility disc method. phytochemical analysis of the extract was performed following established methods. results: the extract showed good but varying in vitro activities against all the isolates tested. while ampicillin showed synergistic interaction with the plant extract against clinical isolates of e. coli and p. mirabilis, septrin was synergistic against the clinical isolate of e. coli only. similarly, the activity of the extract against c. albicans isolate was synergistic with ketoconazole and nystatin. conclusion: the study has validated the folkloric use of o. gratissimum in traditional medicinal practice and goes further to show that the use of this plant material as food spice may not really  threaten the efficacy of some conventional antibiotics that may have been taken concomitantly with it as is the popular belief in the practice of herbal medicine in local/rural communities of many countries in the world.

TI  == bacteriology of external ocular infections in aba, south eastern nigeria.
AB  == background: bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. method: the common isolates were studied in 298  bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. results: in decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), haemophilus influenzae 26  (7.7 per cent), streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). the age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. this was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). klebsiella pneumoniae was the  most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. the bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. conclusion: the study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.

TI  == invasive bacteria isolates from children with severe infections in a nigerian hospital.
AB  == background: little information is available about the aetiology and epidemiology  of serious bacterial infections in nigeria. this study determined bacterial isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of children presenting in the emergency room of a teaching hospital in nigeria. method: from october 2005 to december 2006, children aged two to 60 months presenting with signs of acute systemic infections were recruited. blood culture and csf specimens were collected and processed using standard microbiological protocols. data were analysed using spss version 11 software. results: two hundred and two blood and 69 csf samples were cultured. fifty-five (27%) of the blood cultures yielded gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci in almost equal proportions. the most common isolates from the blood cultures were staphylococcus aureus, 26 (12.9%) and atypical coliforms, 13 (6.5%). others are klebsiella spp, 3 (1.5%); klebsiella pneumonia, 2 (1.0%); escherichia coli, 3 (1.5%); enterobacter agglomerans, 2 (1.1%); proteus mirabilis, 2(1%); pseudomonas spp, 2 (1.0%); haemophilus influenza, 1 (1.0%); and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 1 (1.0%). fourteen out of 67 (20.9%) of the csf samples yielded bacterial isolates: streptococcus pneumonia, 3 (4.5%); haemophilus influenza, 8 (11.9%); hemophilus spp, 1 (1.5%); e. coli, 1 (1.5%); and atypical coliform, 1 (1.5%). gram-negative  coliform isolates were predominantly resistant to penicillin based antibiotics and co-trimoxazole but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones. a high percentage of s. aureus isolates were multi-drug resistant. conclusions: bacterial infections contribute to the significant morbidity among children in our environment. s. aureus was more frequently isolated in sepsis while h. influenzae appears to play a major role in meningitis. appropriate use of antibiotics is needed to manage affected children effectively. we also recommend improved vaccine coverage of children under the age of five years.

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == lysozyme catalyzes the formation of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
AB  == hen egg white lysozyme acted as the sole reducing agent and catalyzed the formation of silver nanoparticles in the presence of light. stable silver colloids formed after mixing lysozyme and silver acetate in methanol and the resulting nanoparticles were concentrated and transferred to aqueous solution without any significant changes in physical properties. activity and antimicrobial assays demonstrated lysozyme-silver nanoparticles retained the hydrolase function of the enzyme and were effective in inhibiting growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus anthracis, and candida albicans. remarkably, lysozyme-silver nanoparticles demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect against silver-resistant proteus mirabilis strains and a recombinant e. coli strain containing the multiple antibiotic- and silver-resistant plasmid, pmg101. results of toxicological studies using human epidermal keratinocytes revealed that lysozyme-silver nanoparticles are nontoxic  at concentrations sufficient to inhibit microbial growth. overall, the ability of lysozyme to assemble silver nanoparticles in a one-step reaction offers a simple  and environmentally friendly approach to form stable colloids of nontoxic silver  nanoparticles that combine the antimicrobial properties of lysozyme and silver. the results expand the functionality of nanomaterials for biological systems and  represent a novel antimicrobial composite for potential aseptics and therapeutic  use in the future.

TI  == needle puncture and transcutaneous bone biopsy cultures are inconsistent in patients with diabetes and suspected osteomyelitis of the foot.
AB  == background: needle puncture has been suggested as a method for identifying bacteria in the bones in patients with diabetes with osteomyelitis of the foot. however, no studies have compared needle puncture with concomitant transcutaneous bone biopsy, which is the current standard recommended in international guidelines. methods: we conducted a prospective study in 2 french diabetes foot clinics. transcutaneous bone biopsy specimens, needle puncture specimens, and swab samples were collected on the same day for each patient. results: overall, 31 patients were included in the study from july 2006 through february 2008. twenty-one bone biopsy specimens (67.7%), 18 needle puncture specimens (58%), and 30 swab samples (96.7%) had positive culture results. staphylococcus aureus was the most common type of bacteria that grew from bone samples, followed by proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. the mean number of bacteria types per positive sample were 1.35, 1.32, and 2.51 for bone biopsy specimens, needle puncture specimens, and swab samples, respectively. among the 20 patients with positive bone biopsy specimens (69%), 13 had positive needle puncture samples. overall, the correlation between microbiological results was 23.9%, with s. aureus showing the strongest correlation (46.7%). results of cultures of bone biopsy and needle  puncture specimens were identical for 10 (32.3%) of 31 patients. bone bacteria were isolated from the needle punctures in 7 (33.3%) of the 21 patients who had positive bone biopsy specimen culture results. if the results of cultures of needle puncture specimens alone had been considered, 5 patients (16.1%) would have received unnecessary treatment, and 8 patients (38.1%) who had positive bone culture results would not have been treated at all. conclusions: our results suggest that needle punctures, compared with transcutaneous bone biopsies, do not identify bone bacteria reliably in patients with diabetes who have low-grade infection of the foot and suspected osteomyelitis.

TI  == isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  == aim of the study: the aerial parts of thymus kotschyanus boiss. and hohen. (lamiaceae) and flower buds of dianthus caryophyllus l. (caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. materials and methods: compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: two known compounds were isolated from the essential  oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. the isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thymol mic values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and b. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a mic value of 15.6 microg/ml. eugenol achieved stronger mic values against  most tested pathogens and the best mic value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and k. pneumoniae whereas, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and e. coli were inhibited with a mic value of 31.2 microg/ml. combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the  best synergistic result was seen against p. mirabilis and e. coli. conclusions: the isolation of two antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  == a number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two gram-positive strains of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with lc(50) of 5.8 mum and 5.6 mum respectively. however, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-negative strains,  such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.

AB  == aim: to compare the survival of four bacterial strains (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa) in pharmaceutical oils, including jojoba oil/tea tree oil, carbol oil, jojoba oil and sesame oil. methods and results: oils were spiked with the test bacteria in a concentration of 10(4)  cfu ml(-1). bacteria were extracted from oils with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% tween 20. aliquots of the pooled water layers were analysed by solid-phase cytometry and plate counting. plate counts dropped to zero for all test strains exposed for 24 h to three of the four oils. in contrast, significant numbers of viable cells were still detected by spc, except in the jojoba oil/tea  tree oil mixture and partly in sesame oil. conclusions: exposure of bacteria for  24 h to the two oils containing an antimicrobial led to a loss of their culturability but not necessarily of their viability. the antibacterial activity  of the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture supersedes that of carbol oil. significance and impact of the study: these in vitro data suggest that the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture more than carbol oil inhibits bacterial proliferation when used for intermittent self-catherization.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of pomegranate rind extracts: enhancement by addition of metal salts and vitamin c.
AB  == background: punica granatum l. or pomegranates, have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against a range of gram positive and negative bacteria. pomegranate formulations containing ferrous salts have enhanced although short-term, antibacteriophage activities which are rapidly diminished owing to instability of the ferrous combination. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activities of combinations of pomegranate rind extracts (pre) with a range of metals salts with the added stabiliser vitamin c. methods: pre solutions, prepared by blending rind sections with distilled water prior to sterilisation by autoclaving or filtration, were screened with a disc diffusion assay using penicillin g as a control. suspension assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of pre alone and in combination with salts of the following metals; fe (ii), cu (ii), mn (ii) or zn (ii), and vitamin c, against a  panel of microbes following exposure for 30 mins. the test organisms included staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. results: the screening assay demonstrated that  pre exhibited activity against the gram positive organisms at 24 h with no observable effect on any of the gram negative bacteria. however, after 12 h, zones of inhibition were only observed for ps. aeruginosa. in contrast, using the suspension assay, addition of cu (ii) salts to pre solutions extended the activities resulting in no detectable growth being observed for the pre/cu (ii) combination against e. coli, ps. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis. minimal antimicrobial activity was observed following incubation with fe (ii), mn (ii) or zn (ii) salts alone or in combination with pre against any of the organisms in the test panel. the addition of vitamin c markedly enhanced the activities of both pre/fe (ii) and pre/cu (ii) combinations against s. aureus. conclusion: this is the first report demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of pre/metal salt combinations in the presence of the stabilising agent vitamin c, to which all isolates were sensitive with the exception of b. subtilis. this study has validated the exploration of pre along with additives such as metal salts and vitamin c as novel antimicrobial combinations.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == chitosan acetate bandage as a topical antimicrobial dressing for infected burns.
AB  == an engineered chitosan acetate bandage preparation (hemcon) is used as a hemostatic dressing, and its chemical structure suggests that it should also be antimicrobial. we previously showed that when a chitosan acetate bandage was applied to full-thickness excisional wounds in mice that had been infected with pathogenic bioluminescent bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus), it was able to rapidly kill the bacteria and save the mice from developing fatal infections. wound healing was also stimulated. in the  present study, we asked whether a chitosan acetate bandage could act as a topical antimicrobial dressing when it was applied to third-degree burns in mice contaminated with two of these bacterial species (p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis). preliminary experiments established the length of burn time and the number of bacteria needed to produce fatal infections in untreated mice and established that the chitosan acetate bandage could adhere to the infected burn for up to 21 days. in the case of p. aeruginosa infections, the survival rate of  mice treated with the chitosan acetate bandage was 73.3% (whereas the survival rate of mice treated with a nanocrystalline silver dressing was 27.3% [p = 0.0055] and that of untreated mice was 13.3% [p < 0.0002]). for p. mirabilis infections, the comparable survival rates were 66.7%, 62.5%, and 23.1% respectively. quantitative bioluminescent signals showed that the chitosan acetate bandage effectively controlled the growth of bacteria in the burn and prevented the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that chitosan acetate bandage is efficacious in preventing fatal burn infections.

TI  == biofilm structure differentiation based on multi-resolution analysis.
AB  == quantitative parameters for describing the morphology of biofilms are crucial towards establishing the influence of growing conditions on biofilm structure. parameters used in earlier studies generally fail to differentiate complex three-dimensional structures. this article presents a novel approach of defining  a parameter vector based on the energy signature of multi-resolution analysis, which was applied to differentiating biofilm structures from confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) biofilm images. the parameter vector distinguished differences in the spatial arrangements of synthetic images. for real clsm images, this parameter vector detected subtle differences in biofilm structure for three sample cases: (1) two adjacent images of a clsm stack; (2) two partial  stacks from the same clsm stack with equal numbers of images but spatially offset by one image; and (3) three complete clsm stacks from different bacterial strains. it was also observed that filtering the noise in clsm images enhanced the sensitivity of the differentiation using our parameter vector.

AB  == this study investigated the influence of urease-positive non-helicobacter pylori  bacteria on the results of a urea breath test (ubt) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a ubt using film-coated [(13)c]urea tablets. the ubt was performed in  102 patients treated with a proton pump inhibitor and antibiotics for the eradication of h. pylori. urease-producing bacteria other than h. pylori were isolated and identified from the oral cavity and stomach. in 4/102 patients, the  ubt gave false-positive results. these false-positive results were found to be caused by the presence of urease-positive bacteria in the oral cavity and stomach. five bacterial species with urease activity (proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus aureus) were subsequently isolated from the oral cavity and/or stomach. as there was no correlation between the in vitro urease activity of urease-positive non-h. pylori bacteria and the ubt value, and all of the patients with a false-positive ubt result were suffering from atrophic gastritis, it is possible that the false-positive results in the ubt were a result of colonization of urease-positive bacteria and gastric hypochlorhydric conditions. thus, for the diagnosis of h. pylori infection using a ubt, the influence of stomach bacteria must be considered when interpreting the results.

TI  == incisional surgical infection in heart transplantation.
AB  == background: incisional surgical site infections (issis) are common bacterial infections in heart transplantation (ht). the purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, timing, and risk factors for issis. methods: a prospective study was performed, which included all heart transplants carried out in the participating hospitals (pertaining to the spanish national hospital network resitra) between august 2003 and february 2005. a population of 292 consecutive patients was included (84.9% males). the definition of issi used in the study was based on the centers for disease control criteria. results: seventeen episodes of issis were recorded in 14 patients (4.8%; confidence interval [ci] 95% 2.7-7.7%). the median time from transplant to issi was 14 days  (range 3-75). two patients (14%) died; fatality was related to issi (mediastinitis) in 1 patient (7%). coagulase-negative staphylococci (7 cases), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), proteus mirabilis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, candida albicans, and candida glabrata, 1 case each, were the isolated pathogens. the duration of extracorporeal circulation was longer in patients with issi, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. antibiotic prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin alone (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% ci, 1.2-216.9) was independently associated with the development of issi. conclusions: issis in ht are frequently  caused by resistant bacteria and candida, but are associated with good prognosis.

TI  == purification, characterization and bactericidal activities of basic phospholipase a2 from the venom of agkistrodon halys (chinese pallas).
AB  == agkistrodon snake venoms contain a variety of phospholipases (pla2), some of which are myotoxic. in this study, we used reverse-phase hplc to purify pla2 from the venom of agkistrodon halys. the enzyme named as agktx-ii, a basic asp49 pla2, has a molecular masses of 13,869.05. the amino acid sequence and molecular mass of agktx-ii was identical to those of an asp49 basic myotoxic pla2 previously isolated from this venom. antibacterial activities were tested by susceptibility  and broth-dilution assays. agktx-ii exerted a potent antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and burkholderia pseudomallei. the mic values of agktx-ii ranged between 85 and 2.76microm and was most effective against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis (mic of 21.25microm) and b. pseudomallei (mic of 10.25microm). this agktx-ii rapidly killed s. aureus, p. vulgaris and b. pseudomallei in a dose-dependent manner. the effect of the agktx-ii on bacterial membranes was evaluated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. agktx-ii caused morphological alterations apparent on their cellular surfaces, suggesting a killing mechanism based on membrane permeabilization and damage. cytotoxicity was measured by xtt tetrazolium (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) assays using u-937 cells (monocytes). the agktx-ii did not affect cell viability up to 500microm concentrations but cell death was evident at 1000microm concentration after 24 and 48h. furthermore, the repeated exposure of agktx-ii (2-14microm) treated mice showed different tissue alterations, mainly at the brain and kidney; the toxicological potential of agktx-ii remains to be elucidated. the agktx-ii exhibits no hemolytic action even at high doses (10-100microm) in human erythrocytes. however, the agktx-ii is believed to exert its bactericidal effect by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane by forming pores. in addition, the basic pla2 agktx-ii displays a bactericidal effect, which may be either dependent or independent of catalysis.

AB  == rifaximin, a poorly absorbed rifamycin derivative, exhibited time-dependent bactericidal activity and at concentrations as low as 1/32 of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) caused morphological alterations in both susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. spontaneous rifaximin-resistant clones appeared with an incidence of 2.6 x 10(-7). the percentage of escherichia  coli cells cured of various plasmids ranged from: 4.5-70% (flac), 0-18% (pbp507), 7.7-43.8% (plasmid carrying esbl genes) and 22.4-41.6% (plasmid encoding toxin from etec mex264). 8.4-18.2 and <0.1-18% of staphylococcus aureus cells were cured (plasmid-mediated penicillinase), 9.5-58.6% of morganella morganii (esbl),  10.6-47.1% citrobacter freundii (esbl), 2.3-38.7% of proteus mirabilis (esbl) and 14.3-66.6% of klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl). rifaximin reduced plasmid transfer from donor to recipient strains by >99%. the mic of ceftazidime was reduced (2-4  dilutions) in the presence of rifaximin (0.5 x mic) in esbl producing strains. rifaximin lowered the viability and virulence of the bacteria even though they developed resistance to the compound. in conclusion, the present findings add new features to the microbiological characteristics of rifaximin and suggest that if  in vivo pathogens are exposed to sub-mics of the drug, not only are their physiological functions compromised, but gene virulence and antibiotic resistance are not fully expressed.

TI  == the establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == pharmacodynamic performance of tigecycline versus common intravenous antibiotics  for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == background: in clinical trials tigecycline was similar to vancomycin/aztreonam for complicated skin and skin structure infections, but data comparing it with other widely used antibiotics are lacking. we predicted the pharmacodynamic cumulative fraction of response (cfr) of tigecycline against bacteria implicated  in complicated skin and skin structure infections and compared it with the cfrs for piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and imipenem/cilastatin.  methods: a 5,000-patient monte carlo simulation using a two-compartment intravenous infusion model was used to simulate steady-state concentrations for common dosages of these antibiotics. population pharmacokinetics data from infected patients were employed. the cfr was calculated against staphylococcus aureus (42% methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]), streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, and pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from worldwide surveillance (test and sentry) and weighted by prevalence of involvement in complicated skin and skin structure infections. results: excluding mrsa, the weighted cfr was greatest for imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam regimens (93.9%-95.9%). with 42% mrsa added to the model, only tigecycline monotherapy achieved a high cfr (88.2%). the addition of vancomycin raised the cfr to 91.0%, 89.5%, 88.3%, 82.9%, and 78% for imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q6h, imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q8h, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone regimens, respectively. conclusion: tigecycline monotherapy had a likelihood of achieving its requisite pharmacodynamic exposure similar to that of combinations of piperacillin/tazobactam or imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  == a horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (rcws) in taiwan. some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mdr-pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab), were identified. pulsotypes of esbl-producing p. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the prevalences of mrsa, esbl-producing e. coli (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) p. aeruginosa, mdr-pa, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii and mdr-ab were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0%  and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. among the 44 respiratory isolates of  p. mirabilis with an esbl phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were mycobacterium tuberculosis. among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). high prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in rcws.

TI  == viper metalloproteinase (agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  == metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. snake venom metalloproteinases (svmps) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. a 23.1 kda protein was isolated from agkistrodon halys (pallas, chinese viper) snake venom. the toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an n-terminal sequence (miqvllvticlavfpyqgssiiles) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the viperidae family. the antibacterial effect of agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (ahm) on burkholderia pseudomallei (strains tes and khw), escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (gram-negative bacteria) and staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microm. interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against s. aureus, p. vulgaris, p. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant b. pseudomallei (strain khw) bacteria. ahm variants with high bacteriostatic activity (mic 1.875-60 microm) also tended to be less cytotoxic against u-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mm concentrations. these results suggest that this  metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.

AB  == hydro-distilled volatile oils from the leaves of ocimum gratissimum l. (lamiaceae) of 13 populations of different silvicultural zones were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (staphylococcus aereus, bacillus spp.) and gram negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, samonella typhi, klebisiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis) bacteria and a pathogenic fungus, candida albicans. all the essential oils are active to the tested microbiles with different strength. the highest antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosae and proteus mirabilis) was observed from the eastern kenya (meru) oil. meru oil was the best and its effectiveness was consistent on nearly all the microbes tested. the oil from the plant growing in the coastal region of kenya (mombasa) showed the best effect only on gram negative bacteria (escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis). both oils (meru and mombasa) were dominated by monoterpenes accounting for 92.48% and 81.37% respectively. the monoterpene fraction was characterized by a high percentage of eugenol (68.8%) for meru oil and 74.10% for mombasa oil. the other major monoterpene was methyl eugenol (13.21%). camphor (0.95%) was observed only in the meru oil. (cis)-ocimene, (trans)-ocimene and beta-pinene were present in both meru and mombasa oils. the sesquiterpenes present in fairly good amounts in both oils were germacrene d and (trans)-caryophyllene. the minor sesquiterpenes were alpha-farnesene (0.85%) and beta-bisabolene (0.74%) which were present in the meru oil only.

TI  == drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic post-operative wounds in a regional referral hospital in uganda.
AB  == background: wound infections have been a problem in the field of surgery for a long time. advances in control of infections have not completely eradicated this  problem because of development of drug resistance. antimicrobial resistance can increase complications and costs associated with procedures and treatment. objective: a study was carried out on drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic postoperative wounds in jinja hospital, uganda. this study was designed to determine the distribution of bacterial pathogens isolated from septic post-operative wounds and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. method: specimens of pus swabs were collected aseptically and analysed in the laboratory. colony characteristics and grams technique were used to differentiate the organisms. biochemical tests were done to confirm the species of the organisms. sensitivity testing was done on the isolates using the disk diffusion  method. results: pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 58.5% of the specimens.  the isolates were: s.aureus (45.1%), coliforms (16.9%), proteus mirabilis (11.3%), p.aeruginosa (9.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%) and enterobacter spp (2.82%). most of the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. there was resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. staphylococcus aureus was generally sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%), ciprofloxacin (68.7%) and methicillin (75%), but resistant to erythromycin (56.2%) and ampicillin (97%). most of the gram-negative bacteria isolated (coliforms, p.aeruginosa, e.coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae) were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and ceftazidime but resistant to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains formed 25% of this species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%) and ceftazidime (85.7%) but showed resistance to  ciprofloxacin (57.2%). some organisms e.g. s.aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis exhibited multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics tested. conclusion: since a high proportion of samples had positive cultures, infection control is recommended as a strategy to minimise spread of resistant organisms. it is recommended that gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime be used in preference to ampicillin and amoxycillin for treatment of septic wounds. there is need to develop national surveillance of antibiotic- resistant organisms.

TI  == use of in vitro susceptibility and pathogen prevalence data to model the expected clinical success rates of tigecycline and other commonly used antimicrobials for  empirical treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == the overall expected coverage for tigecycline and selected antimicrobial regimens based upon prevailing susceptibility rates was evaluated for the empirical therapy of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis). consecutive,  non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from 2000-2005 from patients with documented csssi in 57 medical centres located in the usa (38 centres), france (6 centres), germany (7 centres), italy (3 centres) and spain (3 centres) were used  to evaluate the frequency of pathogen occurrence and susceptibility rates of select parenteral antimicrobials (sentry program). by applying pathogen-specific  susceptibility rates to the frequency of pathogen occurrence in each country, the overall expected coverage for each treatment regimen was measured. the most frequently isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (33.3-49.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3-17.2%), escherichia coli (6.6-13.9%) and enterococci  (4.1-8.8%). tigecycline was highly active against the most common pathogens, except for p. aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. the highest overall expected empirical coverage was obtained with combination therapy regimens, including vancomycin plus either imipenem (94.4-99.3%) or piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5-98.2%). among the monotherapy regimens evaluated, tigecycline provided the  highest overall expected coverage in the usa (90.6%), france (89.9%) and italy (83.3%), whilst piperacillin/tazobactam showed the highest expected coverage in germany (93.1%) and imipenem in spain (87.7%). our results suggest that tigecycline represents a viable additional option for the empirical treatment of  csssi in these countries.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (actichelated propolis).
AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  == hypothesis: increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections have also affected the microbial profile  of breast abscesses. objective: to update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. design: retrospective case series. setting: county hospital emergency department. patients: forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range,  20-63 years) with breast abscesses. methods: all cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. main outcome measures: the microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. results: of 46 specimens only 28  showed bacterial yield (61%). of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. the most common organism was s aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with mrsa in 7 (58%). the remaining organisms included coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). all mrsa was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. two anaerobic cultures were positive for propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. many breast abscesses have community-acquired mrsa, with more than 50% of all s aureus and 19% of all cultures being mrsa. this finding parallels the local and national increases in mrsa reported in other soft-tissue infections. with increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.

TI  == a two-step procedure for automatic and accurate segmentation of volumetric clsm biofilm images.
AB  == this paper presents a robust two-step segmentation procedure for the study of biofilm structure. without user intervention, the procedure segments volumetric biofilm images generated by a confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). this automated procedure implements an anisotropic diffusion filter as a preprocessing step and a 3d extension of the otsu method for thresholding. applying the anisotropic diffusion filter to even low-contrast clsm images significantly improves the segmentation obtained with the 3d otsu method. a comparison of the results for several clsm data sets demonstrated that the accuracy of this procedure, unlike that of the objective threshold selection algorithm (ots), is not affected by biofilm coverage levels and thus fills an important gap in developing a robust and objective segmenting procedure. the effectiveness of the  present segmentation procedure is shown for clsm images containing different bacterial strains. the image saturation handling capability of this procedure relaxes the constraints on user-selected gain and intensity settings of a clsm. therefore, this two-step procedure provides an automatic and accurate segmentation of biofilms that is independent of biofilm coverage levels and, in turn, lays a solid foundation for achieving objective analysis of biofilm structural parameters.

TI  == in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
AB  == enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces  its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug  interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of  h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also  studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus  aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.

TI  == efficacy of ertapenem in the treatment of early ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objectives: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a frequent complication of patients admitted to intensive care units (icus). ertapenem is a newer carbapenem with good in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing organisms. however, there are no clinical data to support the use of ertapenem in vap. our purpose is to evaluate the usefulness and safety of  ertapenem in the treatment of vap caused by susceptible esbl strains. methods: ertapenem 1 g daily intravenously was given to adult patients with signs and symptoms of vap beginning within 7 days of mechanical ventilation and caused by esbl-producing gram-negative organisms. results: from june 2005 to june 2006, we  enrolled 20 adult patients hospitalized in an icu and diagnosed with vap due to gram-negative esbl strains. causative organisms identified as esbl producers susceptible to ertapenem were klebsiella pneumoniae (alone in 10 cases and with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 4 cases), enterobacter cloacae (2), proteus mirabilis (2) and citrobacter freundii (2). clinical success was achieved in 16/20 (80%) of the clinically evaluable patients and in 15/20 (75%) of the microbiologically evaluable patients. the drug was well-tolerated; one patient presented a transient increase in liver enzymes. conclusions: we believe  this is one of the first reports to demonstrate that ertapenem has clinical utility in treating serious infections caused by esbl-producing organisms. ertapenem appears to be suitable for esbl vap therapy. this pilot study suggests  subsequent controlled randomized trials in this indication.

TI  == canine cathelicidin (k9cath): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection.  although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel  canine cathelicidin (k9cath). the full-length cdna sequence of k9cath encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature k9cath  peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. synthetic k9cath displayed broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus; mics (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microm, respectively), gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella serotype typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis; mics 1.25 microm, salmonella serotype  enteritidis; mic 0.5 microm, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; mic 0.06 microm), and yeast (candida albicans; mic 12.5-50 microm). k9cath demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against ureaplasma urealyticum (mic 0.06 and 50 microm, respectively). similar to its ovine congener smap-29, k9cath possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and lps binding capacity. k9cath displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. the potency and broad antimicrobial  activity of k9cath suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates from primary care clinics to oral antibacterial agents].
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates from specimens of patients  in primary care clinics in 2005 was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral antibacterial agents. the numbers of test strains were 550 for gram-positive aerobes, 700 for gram-negative aerobes, and 150 for anaerobes. cefcapene (cfpn), cefditoren (cdtr), and cefteram (cftm) showed the most potent activities against staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. among the cephems tested and moxifloxacin (mflx) and tosufloxacin among the  new quinolones. although the new quinolones generally showed potent activities against these species, resistant strains were frequently detected in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in addition, 70% or more of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were intermediate or resistant to macrolides. cephems showed good activities against aerobic gram-negative bacteria except for  proteus spp. specifically, cfpn, cdtr, and cftm showed the most potent activity against haemophilus influenzae among the cephems tested. the new quinolones showed potent activities against gram-negative bacteria, especially h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not against proteus mirabilis and providencia spp. when compared with the susceptibilities of clinical isolates from tertiary care hospitals, found in other research, differences were noted, for example, there was a lower frequency of quinolone-resistant strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus but a higher frequency of macrolide-resistant strains of streptococcus  pyogenes. therefore, to accurately grasp susceptibility trends, well-focused surveillance studies are necessary.

AB  == aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis  venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order  of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.

TI  == evaluating antibiotics for use in medicine using a poloxamer biofilm model.
AB  == background: wound infections, due to biofilms, are a constant problem because of  their recalcitrant nature towards antibiotics. appropriate antibiotic selection for the treatment of these biofilm infections is important. the traditional in vitro disc diffusion method for antibiotic selection uses bacterial cultures grown on agar plates. however, the form of bacterial growth on agar is not representative of how bacteria grow in wounds and other tissue sites as here bacteria grow naturally in a biofilm. the aim of this research was to test a more appropriate method for testing antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms and compare with the standard methods used for antibiotic sensitivity testing. methods: outer membrane protein analysis was performed on e.coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and acinetobacter juni when grown on mueller hinton agar ('quasi-biofilm state') and 30% poloxamer hydrogel ('true- biofilm state). susceptibility to antibiotics on 28 clinical isolates was determined using the modified kirby bauer disc diffusion method, on agar and 30%  poloxamer. results: similar outer membrane proteins [omps] were identified in bacteria grown in a biofilm state and on a 30% poloxamer hydrogel, which were very different to the omps identified in bacteria grown on mueller-hinton agar and broth. there was a significant difference between the means of the clearance  zones around the antibiotic discs on standard agar and poloxamer gels [p < 0.05]. the zones of clearance were generally smaller for poloxamer-grown bacteria than those grown on standard agar. diffusion distances of various antibiotics through  agar and 30% poloxamer showed no significant difference [p > 0.05]. conclusion: the findings of this experiment suggest that poloxamer gel could be used as an appropriate medium on which to conduct biofilm antibiotic susceptibility tests as it enables bacteria to be grown in a state representative of the infected surface from which the culture was taken.

TI  == [bacteriological evaluation in chronic otitis media].
AB  == introduction: in chronic otitis media bacterial infection is often a cause of exacerbation in the clinical course and failure in treatment. the aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and profile of the aerobic bacterial flora in chronic otitis media and to determine the drug susceptibility of selected isolated bacteria. material and methods: the samples of 274 consecutive middle ear discharges taken from 228 patients with chronic otitis media were analysed (which constitutes 41.3% all bacteriological examinations made during 3 years). the smears were obtained using sterile cotton swabs, then incubated and identified. drug susceptibility was determined by disc-diffusion method. results: monocultures were observed in 77% and mixed infections in 17.5% of smears, no growth was found in 5.5%. the 308 pathogen isolates were recovered, among them--273 bacterial (88.6%) and 35--fungal (11.4%). twenty five species of bacterial microorganisms were found, among them the most common isolates were staphylococcus aureus--42.9% and pseudomonas aeruginosa---19.8%. rarely were recovered acinetobacter spp.--4.1%, proteus mirabilis--37%, proteus vulgaris--3.3% and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus--1.5% of bacterial isolates. among fungal pathogens (n=35) aspergillus spp. was isolated in 37.1%, and candida albicans--22.9% of cases. conclusions: (1) aerobic pathogens ---aphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were most frequently found microorganisms in chronic otitis media. (2) mixed infections comprised only a 17.5% of all cultured cases of chronic otitis media. (3) pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible in vitro to imipenem (100%), piperacillin-tazobactam (100%), ceftazidime (98%) and amikacin (89.7%), less susceptible to ciprofloxacin (77.6%) and much less susceptible to pefloxacin (33.6%) and cefotaxim (33.3%).

TI  == in-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens that cause community-acquired urinary tract infections in antananarivo, madagascar.
AB  == background: urinary tract pathogens obtained from patients in madagascar are becoming increasingly resistant to commonly used antibiotics that are readily available at a low price. this poses a real problem for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections (utis) in madagascar. objectives: to  obtain data on the pathogens responsible for community-acquired utis in antananarivo and on their susceptibility patterns to the antimicrobial agents that are currently used to treat utis. methods: we conducted a retrospective study on bacteria isolated from the urine of patients at the institut pasteur of  madagascar between january 2004 and april 2006. results: we isolated 903 pathogens from 673 women and 213 men. the most commonly isolated bacteria were escherichia coli (607 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (87 strains), staphylococcus aureus (35 strains) and proteus mirabilis (32 strains). seventy-seven per cent of gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 65.7% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and more than 15% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. strains were rarely resistant to more expensive antibiotics (ceftriaxone 5.9%, fosfomycin 4.6%). most bacteria showed intermediate susceptibility to nitroxolin. resistance rates of e. coli to ceftriaxone and gentamicin increased significantly between 2005 and 2006, due to  the increase in strains harbouring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. gram-positive bacteria, streptococcaceae and staphylococcus spp. were rarely resistant, but 9.5% of streptococci were resistant to penicillin a and 8% of staphylococci were resistant to oxacillin. conclusions: the rate of amoxicillin-  and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant enterobacteriaceae implies that another antibiotic should be used for empirical treatment and that there is a need for new generic drugs in developing countries, especially in madagascar.

TI  == are laboratory-based antibiograms reliable to guide the selection of empirical antimicrobial treatment in patients with hospital-acquired infections?
AB  == objectives: antibiograms are often taken into account to define a rational selection of an empirical antimicrobial therapy for treating patients with hospital-acquired infections. in this study, we performed a paired comparison between the antibiogram constructed with laboratory-based data and that formed with data subjected to prior clinical validation. methods: between 2003 and 2005, the laboratory of microbiology printed in duplicate every individual susceptibility report corresponding to hospitalized patients and the copy was sent to the department of infection control. every individual report was assessed in real time at the bedside of the patient by a multidisciplinary team for clinical significance and appropriateness of the specimen, as well as for the type, source and origin of the infection. cumulative resistance rates were estimated in parallel at the laboratory with the whole data, and at the infection control department with data subjected to prior clinical validation. these rates  were designated as 'laboratory-based' and 'clinically based', respectively. results: a total of 2305 individual susceptibility reports were assessed. only 1429 (62.0%) were considered as clinically significant by the multidisciplinary team. escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii group, klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, as well as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, were significantly more frequent in the clinically based rates (p < or = 0.03). conclusions: laboratory-based data underestimate the frequency of several major resistant organisms in patients with hospital-acquired infection. previous clinical validation of the individual susceptibility reports seems to be a suitable strategy to get more reliable data.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program on 3 continents.
AB  == selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use  in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. the purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3  continents using data from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. a total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. with a  protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or  =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. broth microdilution methods and current clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint criteria were used. the 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in north america (27.4%) and europe (19.0%), but escherichia coli was most common in latin america (19.3%). all streptococcus pneumoniae strains from north america and latin america were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. however, 2 s. pneumoniae strains from italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/ml). ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci  were clonal. numerous strains of klebsiella spp. (22.5%), e. coli (4.5%), and proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from latin america and 1 from europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 p. aeruginosa isolates from turkey were resistant to polymyxin b (> or =4 microg/ml), and 8.7% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from latin america were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because  new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age  group.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  == [colonization of cental venous catheter in the intensive care units at the institute of cardiovascular disease "dedinje"--one year study].
AB  == objectives: the application of central venous catheters (cvc) is associated with  increased risk of microbial colonization and infection. the aim of present study  was to assess the frequency of pathogens colonizing cvc and to determine their susceptibility pattern to various antimicrobial agents. materials and methods: a  total of 253 samples of cvc from intensive care units (icu) patients were received for culture during 2003. all microorganisms were identified by standard  microbiological methods and the susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was determined according to nccls recommendations. results: a total of 184 (72.7%) cultures were positive and 223 pathogens were isolated. coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) were the dominant isolates (24.7%), followed by enterobacter  spp. (12.1%), pseudomonas spp. (11.7%), enterococcus spp. (9.9%), klebsiella spp. (8.6%), candida spp. (7.6%), acinetobacter spp. (7.6%), other gram negative nonfermentative bacilli (5.8%), serratia spp. (4.5%), staphylococcus aureus (2.6%), proteus mirabilis (2.2%), e. coli (1.8%) and citrobacter spp. (0.9%). meropenem (84.5%) and vancomycin (100%) remain the most effective antimicrobial agents against gram negative and gram positive bacteria, respectively. conclusion: gram negative bacilli and cns are the commonest microorganisms colonizing cvc from icu patients. the increasing resistance of the bacteria to antimicrobial agents is the major problem in spite of restricted policy of using  antimicrobial agents in icu.

TI  == using interrupted time series analysis to assess associations of fluoroquinolone  formulary changes with susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens and isolation rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolation rate. susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the mrsa isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p, 0.042) and escherichia coli (p, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising mrsa isolation rate (p, 0.001)  were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. substitution  of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in e. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in mrsa isolation rate. no associations were detected on susceptibility of  klebsiella pneumoniae or proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. these findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of mrsa may vary by both drug and organism.

TI  == use of chitosan bandage to prevent fatal infections developing from highly contaminated wounds in mice.
AB  == hemcon bandage is an engineered chitosan acetate preparation used as a hemostatic control dressing, and its chemical structure suggests that it should also be antimicrobial. we tested its ability to rapidly kill bacteria in vitro and in mouse models of infected wounds. we used the gram-negative species pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis and the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus that had all been stably transduced with the entire bacterial lux operon to allow in vivo bioluminescence imaging. an excisional wound in balb/c mice was inoculated with 50-250 million cells followed after 30 min by application of hemcon bandage, alginate sponge bandage, silver sulfadiazine cream or no treatment. hemcon was more adhesive to the wound and conformed well to the injury compared to alginate. animal survival was followed over 15 days with observations of bioluminescence emission and animal activity daily. chitosan acetate treated mice infected with p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis all survived while those receiving no treatment, alginate and silver sulfadiazine demonstrated 25-100% mortality. chitosan acetate was much more effective than other treatments in rapidly reducing bioluminescence in the wound consistent with its rapid bactericidal activity in vitro as well as  its light-scattering properties. s. aureus formed only non-lethal localized infections after temporary immunosuppression of the mice but hemcon was again more effective in reducing bioluminescence. the data suggest that chitosan acetate rapidly kills bacteria in the wound before systemic invasion can take place, and is superior to alginate bandage and silver sulfadiazine that may both  encourage bacterial growth in the short term.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
AB  == chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. this question led us  to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some  ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli were used  for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used  alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin hcl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. drops were placed on whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto mueller-hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. after overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees c, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. there was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. the inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in  combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica).
AB  == the goal of the north american urinary tract infection collaborative alliance (nautica) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained  in various geographic regions in the usa and canada. forty-one medical centres (30 from the usa and 11 from canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. susceptibility testing was determined using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) microdilution method. resistance breakpoints used were those published by the nccls, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/ml), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (smx/tmp) (resistant > or = 4 microg/ml), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or =  4 microg/ml) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/ml). of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the usa and 24.9% (496) were collected from canada. the mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. the most common organisms were escherichia coli (57.5%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), enterococcus spp. (6.6%), proteus mirabilis (5.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), citrobacter spp. (2.7%), staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), klebsiella spp. (1.2%), enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to smx/tmp, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. for the 1142 e. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, smx/tmp 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. for all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 e. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in us compared with canadian medical centres. this study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in us versus canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == n,n-dichlorotaurine: chemical and bactericidal properties.
AB  == the biogenous antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine (nct) converts by disproportionation to n,n-dichlorotaurine (ndct) at a rate proportional to acidity. this occurs at appreciable amounts already in weakly acidic biological systems. to understand the consequences of ndct formation, a thorough investigation of this undescribed compound was mandatory, which needed its synthesis. differently from nct, this was possible in the aqueous system using trichloroisocyanuric acid. while the free acid, cl(2)hnch(2)ch(2)so(3)h, was not  available in pure form, its sodium and potassium salts were analytically pure and showed melting points (decomposition) of 125-128 degrees c (potassium) and 162-164 degrees c (sodium). the sodium salt demonstrated unexpected long-term stability even at room temperature (8.4 % loss of activity within 4 months). the  aqueous solutions of both salts exhibited a weak acid reaction, and they were less stable than nct. with regard to chlorination of amines (transhalogenation),  ndct was, surprisingly, less efficacious than nct, which manifested itself by a lack of reactivity at ph < 7, for which a mechanistic explanation is given. compared on a molar scale, ndct was more bactericidal than nct against the gram-negative bacteria e. coli, p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis, while there was no difference concerning the gram-positive ones, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. the increase of bactericidal activity at acidic ph was the same as observed with  nct and is attributed to a higher susceptibility of bacteria in this environment. taken together, ndct seems not to be suited to substitute nct as a preparation fit for medical practice.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == the family of serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

AB  == a 67-year-old man is presented with longstanding and severe darier disease treated by topical antiseptics and potent corticosteroids, in combination with oral glucocorticoids and etretinate. after cardiac bypass surgery in 1997, the patient experienced herpes simplex virus (hsv type-1) infection of the skin that  was treated by intravenous aciclovir. in 2003, he presented a widespread atypical exacerbation of his darier disease, involving the face, trunk, buttocks, intertriginous areas and arms. initial clinical signs and bacteriological findings suggested a bacterial involvement by multiresistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. despite  antibiotherapy, the clinical presentation progressively worsened. a skin biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical examination identified a type-2 hsv infection. although intravenous aciclovir was administered, the widespread cutaneous hsv infection was followed by systemic dissemination. a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) developed, leading to a fatal issue. at autopsy, a severe interstitial type-2 hsv pneumonitis with extensive necrotic areas was found, in association with gastro-intestinal involvement. this case represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of darier disease presenting a fatal type-2 hsv infection. it underlines the importance of rapidly  recognizing hsv infection in darier disease and stresses the risk of lethal outcome. the different risk factors for hsv infection in this patient are reviewed.

TI  == clinical management and outcome of childhood lung abscess: a 16-year experience.
AB  == in order to evaluate the clinical manifestations, management and outcome of childhood lung abscess, a retrospective chart review of 27 pediatric patients with international classification of diseases, ninth revision-clinical modification (icd-9 cm) code of 503.1 (lung abscess) from august 1987 to august 2003 was conducted. among the 27 patients (14 males and 13 females), 30% (8/27) were primary lung abscess and 70% (19/27) had underlying chronic diseases (secondary lung abscess). the predisposing factors of the primary group (n = 8) included 6 cases of respiratory tract infection, 1 with choking during swimming,  and 1 with laceration wound. the underlying diseases in the secondary group (n =  19) included 10 cases of hematologic disorder (52%), 3 of congenital heart disease, 2 of central nervous system anomalies, and 1 each of hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome, chronic lung disease, liver cirrhosis with fistula formation, and swyer-james syndrome. eleven patients (41%) underwent diagnostic tapping, including echo-guided aspiration (10 cases) and computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle aspiration (1 case). positive yield rate from aspiration of lung abscess was 63.6% (7/11). surgical intervention was performed in 8 (42%) of  the secondary group and in 1 patient from the primary group. the pathogens were identified in 11 patients (41%): 5 with oral flora, 2 with staphylococcus aureus  plus other pathogens, 1 with s. aureus alone, 1 with pseudomonas aeruginosa plus  proteus mirabilis, 1 with p. aeruginosa alone, and 1 with aspergillus. the average duration of parenteral antibiotic use was 40 days. five cases (18.5%) died due to poor control of the underlying diseases, and 4 of the patients (15%)  had sequelae (2 with bronchiectasis and 2 with lung fibrosis). seventy percent of lung abscess occurred in children with underlying medical conditions. early percutaneous aspiration has an important role in identification of pathogens. oral anaerobes and s. aureus are the core pathogens in primary lung abscess and gram-negative pathogens should also be considered in secondary lung abscess.

TI  == peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

TI  == bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  == aims: the polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. in addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is  assessed. methods: this is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in adan teaching hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. the patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. the specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. result: staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of  cases. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and proteus mirabilis  (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly bacteroides fragilis. imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive  organisms. conclusion: s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. these wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.

TI  == detection of paragonimus heterotremus eggs in experimentally infected cats by a polymerase chain reaction-based method.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedure for the detection of paragonimus heterotremus eggs in stool samples was developed and compared with stoll's egg count method. the primers were designed on the basis of a previously constructed  pph-13-specific dna probe, which produced an approximate 0.5-kb amplified product. this pcr method could detect as few as 5 eggs in 0.6 g of artificially inoculated feces of a healthy control cat or as little as 1 x 10(-4) ng of p. heterotremus genomic dna. the assay had 100% sensitivity in all infected cats. the method did not yield an approximate 0.5-kb product with dna from other parasites such as gnathostoma spinigerum, trichinella spiralis, fasciola gigantica, echinostoma malayanum, opisthorchis viverrini, dirofilaria immitis, and taenia saginata; exceptions were paragonimus siamensis and paragonimus westermani. in addition, no genomic dna from escherichia coli, burkholderia pseudomallei, acinetobacter anitratus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, beta-streptococcus gra, and proteus mirabilis or from the vertebrate and  invertebrate hosts of p. heterotremus was amplified in the pcr assay. this assay  has great potential for application in clinical epidemiological studies.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == species-dependent premature degradation of absorbable suture materials caused by  infection--impact on the choice of thread in vascular surgery.
AB  == background: in case of infection after vascular reconstruction, preference is often given to absorbable suture material with the aim of preventing persistence  of infection. we have investigated the functional deficit of absorbable sutures on incubation with various different bacteria. material and methods: four suture  materials dexon bicolor, vicryl, maxon and pds ii--were placed in contact with reference bacterial cultures (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeroginosa, e. coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci and proteus mirabilis). the bacteria were  incubated for 7 days at 37 degrees c, together with the suture material. a logarithmic phase (group a) and a static phase (group b) were simulated. the linear tensile strength (lts) of the suture material was measured (instron tensiometer). results: in the case of staphylococcus aureus, a significant decrease in lts was established for dexon bicolor (group a: 31%, group b: 22%), and vicryl (53% and 43%), but not for the monofilament threads. with regard to the other bacteria, a considerably more dramatic effect was observed: in both groups the braided sutures had completely disintegrated after 7 days. the monofilament sutures also revealed a significant loss of function (maxon: 88%, pds ii 66%). conclusions: the absorbable sutures revealed a premature, species-dependent loss of function due to the presence of the bacteria. on the basis of our results, the use of absorbable threads for vessel sutures in case of infection cannot be recommended, with the exception of monofilament material in a monocultural staphylococcus aureus infection.

TI  == [bacterial infections in chronic otitis media--usefulness of molecular diagnostics based on pcr method].
AB  == infections in chronic otitis media (com) are common, and identification of their  pathogen is difficult, what is proven by high rate of negative results of bacteriological examinations. this fact may be explained by two factors: it is difficult to obtain a reliable material for culture and classic methods of bacteriological cultures may be of low sensitivity. amplification of bacterial dna in pcr is an examination, that leads to a higher effectiveness and sensitivity of bacteriological tests. the authors present material of 53 patients with com, previously untreated, in which bacteriological examinations by classic  and molecular pcr method were performed. the results of both methods were compared. in classic method the presence of pathogens was observed in 46 of 53 cases (86.8%). the most often isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.8% of the cases), staphylococcus aureus (15.1%), peptostreptococcus sp. and fusobacterium sp. (11.3% of the cases each) and proteus mirabilis (7.5%). in 7 cases (13.2%) bacteriological results were negative. using molecular diagnostic of pcr, the presence of pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 42 cases (79.2%).  isolated strains of p. aeruginosa were epidemiologically unrelated (93.7% of isolates), what was proven in pcr-finger-printing technique. the authors stated that predominant aerobes pathogens in com are p. aeruginosa and s. aureus and the pcr technique for identification of bacterial dna presence is very sensitive and  allows to precipitate diagnostics of patients with com. combination of classical  bacteriological tests with pcr technique may be very helpful in estimation bacteriological condition of patients with com.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of ave1330a, an innovative broad-spectrum non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  == objectives: production of beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria. despite the current use of clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam, the prevalence of class a and class c enzymes is increasing worldwide, demanding new beta-lactamase inhibitors. here we report the antimicrobial properties of ave1330a, a representative of a novel class of bridged bicyclico[3.2.1]diazabicyclo-octanones in combination with ceftazidime. materials and methods: ic(50) and kinetic parameters of the hydrolysis reaction were used to characterize beta-lactamase inhibition by ave1330a. mics for >600 strains were determined with the combination ceftazidime/ave1330a at a fixed ratio of 4:1. results: ic(50)s of ave1330a for tem-1 and p99 enzymes were 0.0023  mg/l (8 nm) and 0.023 mg/l (80 nm), compared with 0.027 mg/l (130 nm) and 205.1 mg/l (1 x 10(6) nm) of clavulanic acid and 0.013 mg/l (40 nm) and 1.6 mg/l (5000  nm) of tazobactam. a highly stable covalent complex led to a low turnover of ave1330a. mics of ceftazidime/ave1330a for enterobacteriaceae were at least eight-fold lower than those of ceftazidime alone. all of the escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter and proteus mirabilis strains, including ceftazidime-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 4-8 mg/l. only 2 mg/l were required to inhibit other proteeae, enterobacter, salmonella and serratia. conclusion: the combination of ceftazidime with ave1330a exhibited broad-spectrum activity against ambler class a- and class c-producing enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == metalloantibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of cobalt(ii), copper(ii), nickel(ii) and zinc(ii) complexes of kefzol.
AB  == kefzol (kzl), a beta-lactam antibiotic, possesses various donor sites for interaction with transition metal(ii) ions [co(ii), cu(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii)] to form complexes of the type [m(kzl)2]cl2 and [m(kzl)cl], with molar ratio of metal: ligand (m:l) of 1:2 and 1:1 respectively. these complexes were prepared and characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. their ir and nmr  spectra suggest that kefzol potentially acts as a bidentate, tridentate as well as monoanionic tetradentate ligand. the complexes have been screened for antibacterial activity and results were compared with the activity of the uncomplexed antibiotic against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. the metal complexes were found to be more potent against one or more bacterial species than the uncomplexed kefzol.

TI  == prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. in all, 45 male wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. a small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. in the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. in the second group, a disc, which was saturated with staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. in the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. the silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. there was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. in the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of s. epidermidis in two and  proteus mirabilis in the remaining. three and four cultures were positive in the  second and third group, respectively. low colonies of four different organisms (escherichia coli, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. there was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.

TI  == effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  == moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. in this study the activity of moxifloxacin against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive and  gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of s. pneumoniae, m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 x mic of moxifloxacin. in conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == an in vitro study of the anti-microbial efficacy of a 1% silver sulphadiazine and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate cream, 1% silver sulphadiazine cream and a silver  coated dressing.
AB  == burn sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with major  burns. the use of topical anti-microbial agents has helped improve the survival in these patients. there are a number of anti-microbials available, one of which, silvazine (1% silver sulphadiazine (ssd) and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate), is  used only in australasia. no study, in vitro or clinical, had compared silvazine  with the new dressing acticoat. this study compared the anti-microbial activity of silvazine, acticoat and 1% silver sulphadiazine (flamazine) against eight common burn wound pathogens. methods: each organism was prepared as a suspension. a 10 microl inoculum of the chosen bacterial isolate (representing approximately  between 10(4) and 10(5) total bacteria) was added to each of four vials, followed by samples of each dressing and a control. the broths were then incubated and 10  microl loops removed at specified intervals and transferred onto horse blood agar. these plates were then incubated for 18 hours and a colony count was performed. results: the data demonstrates that the combination of 1% ssd and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (silvazine) results in the most effective killing of all bacteria. ssd and acticoat had similar efficacies against a number of isolates, but acticoat seemed only bacteriostatic against e. faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. viable quantities of enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis remained at 24h. conclusion: the combination of 1%  ssd and 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (silvazine) is a more effective anti-microbial against a number of burn wound pathogens in this in vitro study. a clinical study of its in vivo anti-microbial efficacy is required.

TI  == argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period november 2001-march 2002. out of 418 enterobacteriaceae included in the study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. esbls putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of proteus mirabilis and 25% escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as esbls producers notably p.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for esbl producers. esbls producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. the isolates considered as amp c beta lactamase putative producers  showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. noteworthy only 4% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (mic(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against acinetobacter spp (mic(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). only 41.7% acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of haemophilus influenzae isolates (mic(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but  only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as e.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 e.faecium and 1 e.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. all the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (mic(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed mics of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. among 34 viridans group streptococci only  67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (mic(90) 4 microg/ml).piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial  drug to be used, preferably in combination (ie: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in argentina. caution must be taken for infections due to esbl producers considering that the inoculum effect mics can affect mic values.

TI  == comparison of two test methods for the determination of sufficient antimicrobial  activity of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs for hygienic hand disinfection.
AB  == in europe, the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs is determined with a quantitative suspension test (pren 12054) and a test under practical conditions (en 1500). another test method has recently been published by the german society for hygiene and microbiology (dghm) with four differences to the european system in the in vitro tests: additional qualitative suspension tests with product dilutions to the ineffective range; a selection of the most resistant gram-negative test strains in the qualitative suspension test, which should be used adjacent to pseudomonas aeruginosa in the quantitative suspension  test; a high organic load in the quantitative suspension tests (0.3% albumin and  0.3% sheep erythrocytes); and an aqueous control in the quantitative suspension test. according to dghm, the in vitro tests should be followed by en 1500. we have determined the antimicrobial efficacy of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs according to both methods. pren 12054 was carried out without organic load. the qualitative suspension tests (dghm) were carried out with p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus hirae and candida albicans. the quantitative suspension test (dghm)  was carried out with product dilutions of 75%, 50% and 25%, and a high organic load using the following test organisms: p. aeruginosa, p. mirabilis (one product only), s. aureus, e. hirae and c. albicans. all these suspension tests were carried out in quadruplicate with each product and exposure time. en 1500 was carried out with 3 ml of each product and an application time of 30 s. all three  products achieved the required bactericidal activity of pren 12054 and the new dghm method within 30 s, and were equally effective with the reference hand disinfection of en 1500 within 30 s. in our study, the dghm test method did not provide additional information for hand rubs which exhibit their bactericidal efficacy with 3 ml within 30 s (en 1500).

TI  == susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and  to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number  of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations)  per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli  to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all  traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.

TI  == are infections due to resistant pathogens associated with a worse outcome in critically ill patients?
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the outcome of critically ill patients infected with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, and to analyse the factors involved in the development of antimicrobial resistance. methods: all patients admitted to a  31-bed mixed medico-surgical intensive care unit who developed a nosocomial infection were prospectively followed until discharge or death. results: of 949 consecutive patients admitted, 186 developed a nosocomial infection: 79 with an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen and 107 with susceptible strains. the lungs were the main source of infections in both groups. the main resistant microorganisms were enterobacter aerogenes, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  and enterobacter cloacae. the main susceptible microorganisms were enterobacter spp., methicillin susceptible s. aureus (mssa), and proteus mirabilis. patients infected with resistant strains had a longer length of stay prior to infection (9+/-4 vs. 5+/-3 days), longer total length of stay (18+/-16 vs. 11+/-7 days), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (12+/-15 vs. 6+/-7 days), and more severe coagulation, liver, and renal dysfunction (all p<0.05). the maximum degrees of organ failure during the icu stay, and the respiratory dysfunction, but not infection with a resistant pathogen, were independent predictors for death. multivariate logistic regression revealed previous use of multiple antibiotics, duration of length of stay prior to infection, and the degree of liver failure as independent factors for development of infection with resistant  organisms. conclusions: infection with antimicrobial resistant microorganisms is  not an independent predictor for death. the development of antimicrobial resistance is related to the previous use of multiple antibiotics, the icu length of stay, and the severity of hepatic dysfunction.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

AB  == in a biomass assay based on adenosine 5(')-triphosphate (atp) bioluminescence, extracellular atp is removed; then intracellular atp is extracted from the microorganism by an atp extractant and subsequently reacted with luciferase. to provide a highly sensitive assay, the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (bac) in the atp extractant was optimized by using a mutant luciferase resistant  to bac. the use of 0.2% bac, which was acceptable for the luciferase, simultaneously achieved the maximum extraction of intracellular atp from microorganisms and the inactivation of the atp-eliminating enzymes for removal of extracellular atp. the detection limit (blank+3 sd) for atp was 1.8x10(-14)m (1.8x10(-18)mol/assay) in the presence of the atp extractant with coefficients of variation of 0.7 to 6.3%. the reagent system coupled with the atp-eliminating enzymes allowed for the detection of 93 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of escherichia coli atcc 25922, 170cfu/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 170cfu/ml of proteus mirabilis atcc 29906, 68cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, and 7.7cfu/ml of bacillus subtilis atcc 6051. the yeast cell of saccharomyces cerevisiae ifo 10217 could be detected at 1cfu/ml. with 54 kinds of microorganisms, the average atp extraction efficiency compared to the trichloroacetic acid extraction method was 81.0% in 24 strains among gram-negative bacteria, 99.4% in 13 strains among gram-positive bacteria, and 97.0% in 17 strains among yeast. the atp contents of the gram-negative bacteria,  gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts ranged from 0.40 to 2.70x10(-18)mol/cfu (mean=1.5x10(-18)mol/cfu), from 0.41 to 16.7x10(-18)mol/cfu (mean=5.5x10(-18)mol/cfu), and from 0.714 to 54.6x10(-16)mol/cfu (mean=8.00x10(-16)mol/cfu), respectively.

TI  == a hospitalwide intervention program to optimize the quality of antibiotic use: impact on prescribing practice, antibiotic consumption, cost savings, and bacterial resistance.
AB  == several findings from argentina provide compelling evidence of the need for more  rational use of antimicrobial agents. thus, a multidisciplinary antimicrobial treatment committee for the development of a hospital-wide intervention program was formed to optimize the quality of antibiotic use in hospitals. four successive steps were developed during 6-month periods: baseline data collection, introduction of a prescription form, education, and prescribing control. sustained reduction of drug consumption was shown during the study (r2=0.6885; p=.01). total cost savings was 913,236 us dollars. to estimate the consumption of cefepime and aminopenicillin-sulbactam in relation to that of the third-generation cephalosporins, 2 indices were calculated: icfp and iams, respectively. decreasing resistance to ceftriaxone by proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae proved to be associated with increasing icfp. decreasing rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were related to increasing iams. the present study indicates that a systematic program performed by a multidisciplinary team is a cost-effective strategy for optimizing antibiotic prescribing.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == pharmacological profile of extracts of pelargonium sidoides and their constituents.
AB  == in areas of southern africa, aqueous extracts from the roots of pelargonium sidoides are employed to cure various disorders. nowadays, a modern formulation (eps 7630), elaborated from the traditional herbal medicine, is successfully used for the treatment of respiratory tract diseases. we previously observed that root extracts of p. sidoides and their representative constituents exhibit moderate antibacterial and significant immunomodulatory capabilities. the present study was performed to further assess the efficacy and mode of action for these pharmacological activities. the results indicate that p. sidoides extracts may well possess antimycobacterial activity as claimed in traditional uses. furthermore, significant antibacterial properties against multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains as well as tnf-inducing potencies and prominent interferon-like activities in supernatants of sample-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages were observed using several functional assays. in addition, eps 7630 stimulated the synthesis of ifn-beta in mg 63 cells as demonstrated by a specific enzyme immunoassay. for gallic acid, a characteristic  constituent, evidence for the expression of inos and tnf-alpha transcripts in stimulated raw 264.7 cells and, hence, activation at the transcriptional level was revealed by rt-pcr. the present results, when taken together with the recently reported pharmacological activities, provide for a rationale basis of the utilization of eps 7630 in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [etiology and management of persistent hematospermia: a pilot study].
AB  == objectives: to study the etiology of persistent hematospermia and to evaluate the efficacy of transrectal ultrasonography (trus)-guided transperineal needle aspiration and irrigation for diagnosis and treatment of persistent hematospermia. methods: twelve patients were included in the study, with a mean age of (36.4 +/- 10.8) years old, and a mean duration of the disease of (13.9 +/- 6.4) months. after the expressed prostatic secretion (eps) by prostatic massage was cultured, patients with recurrent hematospermia received trus-guided transperineal needle aspiration for seminal vesicle fluid (svf), which was sent for bacteriological and cytological examination. if the eps culture were positive, certain antibiotics according to the drug sensitivity assay were injected into the abnormal seminal vesicle(s) via trus-guided transperineal needle puncture. the treatment would be repeated one month later if the patients  still had hematospermia. the patients were followed up every three months. results: abnormal images were found in left seminal vesicle (sv) in 4 cases, right in 3 cases, bilateral in 2 cases, and no abnormal findings in 3 cases. the  abnormal findings included: 7 cases of sv and/or ejaculatory duct dilation, 3 cases of thickening sv wall, 3 cases of calcification or calculi of sv, and 1 case of mullerian duct cyst. svf cultures were positive in 7 cases: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 4 cases, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcns), e. coli, proteus mirabilis 1 case, respectively. in five of these 7 cases, bacteriological cultures of svf and eps showed the same results. all patients were treated by trus-guided transperineal injection of certain antibiotics into sv. seven cases were injected once, 5 cases twice. the mean follow-up period of 10 patients was (16.7 +/- 5.9) months. hematospermia disappeared in 6 cases. conclusions: sv infection of bacteria, especially infection of the drug resistant strains was one of the main causes of  persistent hematospermia. the difficulties in treatment of persistent hematospermia were due to infection of drug resistant bacteria, calcification or  calculi of sv, obstruction of ejaculatory duct. trus-guided transperineal aspiration of svf was helpful to the etiologic diagnosis of persistent hematospermia.

TI  == [cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  == as a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; activity against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter and klebsiella species; low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. its spectrum is very large being very active against gram-negative bacilii: enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia, citrobacter, proteus mirabilis and less active against bacillus fragillis. cefepime is also very active against gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes. some of the methicillin-resistant strains of  staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; enterococcus is resistant. due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases cefepime (maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

AB  == background: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum is a fulminant, life-threatening condition. this infection is usually polymicrobial and may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or surgery. histologically, it is characterized by obliterative endarteritis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous vessels, fascial necrosis, and leukocytic infiltration. mortality rates of 25-75% have been reported. most cases of necrotizing gangrene begin insidiously, with scrotal discomfort and malaise. later, erythema, increasing pain, and swelling, associated with fever and chills, develop. a biopsy is useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to obtain culture samples. ultrasound imaging may reveal gas or testicular involvement and may help to distinguish this infection from other causes of scrotal pathology. materials and methods: fifteen patients with necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum, seen at the dermatology and plastic surgery sections of our institutions between 1994 and 1999, are described. results: this series included 11 men (73%) and four women (27%), aged  39-68 years (mean, 51 years). in our series, clostridium perfingens, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus viridans, acinetobacter baumani, escherichia coli, and candida albicans were isolated. hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring were performed in all patients. intravenous antimicrobial therapy was promptly instituted. in most cases, two or more drugs were used. concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was always required. when needed, split-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the penile shaft. expanded mesh grafts were used to reconstruct the vulva and other denuded beds. the survival rate in this series was 87%. conclusions: necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. the usual polymicrobial infection with vascular involvement demands hemodynamic stabilization, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement. in some patients, genital, perineal, and abdominal wall reconstruction is also required.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils isolated from portuguese endemic species of thymus.
AB  == aims: thymus species are wild species mostly found in the arid lands of portugal. possible antimicrobial properties of thymus essential oils have been investigated. the chemical composition of the essential oils and the antimicrobial activity of thymus mastichina (l) l. subsp. mastichina, t. camphoratus and t. lotocephalus from different regions of portugal were analysed. methods and results: hydrodistillation was used to isolate the essential oils and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography (gc) and gc coupled to mass spectrometry. the antimicrobial activity was tested by the disc agar diffusion technique against candida albicans, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus. pure linalool, 1,8-cineole and a mixture (1 : 1) of these compounds were included. linalool, 1,8-cineole or linalool/1,8-cineole and linalool/1,8-cineole/linalyl acetate were the major components of the essential oils, depending on the species or sampling place. the essential oils isolated from the thymus species studied demonstrated antimicrobial activity but the micro-organisms tested had significantly different sensitivities. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of essential oils may be related to more than one component. significance and impact of the study: portuguese endemic species of thymus can be used for essential oil  production for food spoilage control, cosmetics and pharmaceutical use. further studies will be required to elucidate the cell targets of the essential oil components.

TI  == epidemiology of bloodstream infection in nursing home residents: evaluation in a  large cohort from multiple homes.
AB  == this study sought to reevaluate the epidemiology of bloodstream infection in nursing home residents. the records of 166 nursing home residents admitted to an  urban, public, university-affiliated hospital with 169 episodes of bloodstream infection between january 1997 and april 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. the  most common organisms isolated were escherichia coli (27% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus (18%; 29% were methicillin-resistant strains), and proteus  mirabilis (13%). there was minimal resistance to quinolones and third-generation  cephalosporins among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. the most common sources were  the urinary tract (51% of episodes) and the lungs (11%); a source was not identified in 22% of episodes. hospital mortality was 18%. independent predictors of hospital mortality were a pulmonary source of infection, systolic blood pressure <90 mm hg, and leukocytosis >20,000 cells/mm3. compared with other studies published in the past 2 decades, mortality was lower. the most common resistant organism was methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.
AB  == background: controversy exists regarding the appropriate prophylactic dose of cefazolin for coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg) surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb) because the effect of cpb on serum drug levels is poorly understood. current standards of prophylaxis are based primarily on empiric studies. few studies have attempted to quantify serum cefazolin levels in either cardiac or noncardiac surgeries. this study was conducted to measure and assess the adequacy of the intraoperative serum levels of prophylactic cefazolin  in cpb surgery. methods: this prospective study serially measured six intraoperative serum cefazolin levels in 10 subjects undergoing elective and urgent cabg surgery. we compared the serum levels with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic90) for the most common organisms causing postoperative infection. results: serum-free cefazolin levels fluctuated considerably during the operation but remained above the mic90, for staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. the serum levels fell below the mic90 for enterobacter, serratia, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis. conclusions: serum cefazolin levels during cpb remained consistently above the mic for two of the three main organisms causing postoperative infection but were suboptimal for the remainder.  additional studies are needed to assess the intraoperative serum levels of single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis and to explore alternate dosing methods that minimize intraoperative fluctuations in serum cefazolin levels.

TI  == is there a need for postoperative surveillance after day case groin surgery in children?
AB  == there is increasing awareness of the value of day case paediatric surgery in fulfilling the needs of the community. is this cost effective, are there hidden complications and is there a need for routine follow-up? seven hundred and thirty-one children attending the red cross war memorial children's hospital day  surgery unit over a 32-month period, and undergoing 912 procedures confined to the inguinoscrotal region, were enrolled in the study. surgical procedures performed included inguinal herniotomy, orchidopexy and circumcision. of the 731  children, 159 consecutive children had their inguinal and perineal skin flora analysed preoperatively and in 59 of these children three skin swabs were taken from the groin area: before routine skin preparation for surgery, after the skin  preparation and on completion of the operation. staphylococcus epidermidis predominated as the normal skin flora (70%), followed by escherichia coli (19%) and proteus mirabilis (10%), while s. aureus was only found in 2.5% of cases. the efficacy of cleaning with 4% chlorhexidine and 2% povidone-iodine in 70% alcohol  is shown by virtual complete eradication of the organisms isolated from the preoperative skin cultures. in only 2 cases (3.4%) were organisms (s. aureus and  s. epidermidis respectively) isolated following skin preparation. cultures taken  at the end of operative procedures grew predominantly s. epidermidis (5 cases, 8.5%). children were discharged from the day unit once they had taken fluids and  had passed urine. the wounds were also checked for any evidence of bleeding. follow-up was done 2 weeks later by means of a visit to the day unit where the same surgeon assessed wound healing according to the southampton wound assessment scale. ninety-four per cent of the wounds had healed by primary intention; 4.5% had minor complications and 1.5% had septic complications. our trial confirms that wound sepsis is an infrequent but significant complication of day case groin surgery. routine follow-up by surgical day units of minor surgical cases is not warranted and will incur unnecessary cost. only 1.5% of postoperative cases will  require further medical attention and septic lesions in the lymphatic drainage area should be regarded as risk factors.

TI  == serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents a new type of hemolysin and has been studied in great molecular detail with regard to structure, activation and secretion. it has nothing in common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type  (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin  of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins.  the s. marcescens hemolysin proteins shlb and shla exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, edwardsiella tarda and erwinia chrysantemi. furthermore, sequence motifs present in shla and shlb have been shown to be important for activity and secretion of the s. marcescens hemolysin. thus, the s. marcescens hemolysin forms the prototype of a new class of hemolysins and of a new secretory mechanism. the uniqueness of this new mechanism is underlined by the fact that activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. new data implicate a conformational change in shla during activation. in addition, shla not only forms pores in erythrocytes but also in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. the cytotoxic action of shla is mainly determined by lysis of infected cells in vitro. in sublytic doses, as will normally be the situation in vivo, shla exerts additionally effects which are currently under investigation. the knowledge of the structure, activation, secretion and mode of action of s. marcescens hemolysin has implications for proteins, related in sequence or in mode of secretion and activation.

TI  == intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to  human subjects. methods: thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. the indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole  (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results: all the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by hplc. the level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. a mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. the level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. conclusion: the vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the mic(90) against proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterobacter spp.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of folklore: mallotus peltatus leaf  extract.
AB  == since ages mallotus peltatus (geist) muell. arg. var acuminatus (euphorbiaceae) leaf and stem bark is used in folk medicine to cure intestinal ailments and skin  infections. in several intestinal ailments, localized inflammation is of common occurrence and hence we have evaluated the antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory activity of m. peltatus leaf extract. the crude methanol extract of m. peltatus leaves was found to be active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis,  escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and the dermatophytic fungi microsporum gypseum. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) ranges from 128 to 2000 microg ml(-1) for bacteria and 128 mg ml(-1) for fungi, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was 2-4-fold higher than mic. the methanol-water fraction of the extract showed similar activity against staphylococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and proteus isolates. the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract against carrageenan (acute model) and dextran-induced (subacute model) rat paw oedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma (chronic model) in rats were studied using indomethacin (10 mg kg(-1)), a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, as standard. the methanol extract at 200 and 400 mg kg(-1), and the n-butanol fractions a and b at 25 mg kg(-1), exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity in albino rats, compared with indomethacin. phytochemical study revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, terpenoids, steroids and reducing sugars in the crude extract while the n-butanol fractions showed the presence of ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol and some fatty acids as major compounds. further study with fractions showed that the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity is due to either fraction a (ursolic acid) alone or the combination of fractions a and b (beta-sitosterol and fatty acids) of the extract.

TI  == pathology of a mouse model of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  == a colony of knockout mice (gene designation cybb tm1) has been maintained at this institution for 5 years. these mice are lacking the b subunit of nadph oxidase and are susceptible to experimental infection with aspergillus fumigatus. the purpose of this study was to document the spontaneous diseases present in these mice which are a murine model of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease and to compare these lesions to those of chronic granulomatous disease in humans. lesions were documented in 72 mice submitted to the necropsy service. all 72 mice had an acidophilic macrophage pneumonia, and 16 also had lobar suppurative and necrotizing pneumonias caused by paecilomyces sp. (11 of the 16 mice), a. fumigatus (3 mice), rhizopus sp. (1 mouse), or candida guilliermondii (1 mouse).  of the 72 animals, 36 had severe bacterial suppurative and necrotizing to pyogranulomatous pneumonias; lung abscesses yielded cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), enterococcus (n = 6), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), s. xylosus (n = 1), coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (n = 4), gram-negative enteric bacilli (n = 6), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and proteus mirabilis (n  = 2). thirteen mice had a necrotizing and suppurative adenitis of the cervical lymph nodes caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp.; s. aureus, s. xylosus, and s. equorum were recovered from abscesses in the cervical lymph nodes, extremities, and head. splenomegaly was found in 30 animals and lymphadenopathy in 11 mice. the array of spontaneously occurring infectious diseases and lesions in these mice is similar to that of human patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. methods: serum and urine samples obtained in a  single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. the doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. results: the titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility  of the pathogen. in serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24  h after 600 mg; for serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. in urine, the titers were greater, and for escherichia coli, staphylococcus saprophyticus, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg  and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. conclusions: these data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

TI  == [in vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus o-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  == background: the correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. to reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. this study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1%  o-phenylphenol. methods: the organisms used were purchased from the american type culture collection (escherichia coli atcc 25922, candida albicans atcc 10231, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228), and from our clinical collection (proteus mirabilis ch 14, klebsiella oxytoca ch 22, serratia liquefaciens ch 90). mic and  mbc were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. the contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. results: the results showed that mic values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. the mbc values were similar or higher than the mic. the disinfectant solution killed e. coli and c. albicans already after 10 min, but for s. aureus 30 min was necessary. conclusions: this study proved that this solution attained  the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.

TI  == novel bacterial membrane surface display system using cell wall-less l-forms of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli.
AB  == we describe a novel membrane surface display system that allows the anchoring of  foreign proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane (cm) of stable, cell wall-less l-form cells of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. the reporter protein, staphylokinase (sak), was fused to transmembrane domains of integral membrane proteins from e. coli (lactose permease lacy, preprotein translocase secy) and p. mirabilis (curved cell morphology protein ccma). both l-form strains overexpressed fusion proteins in amounts of 1 to 100 microg ml(-1), with higher expression for those with homologous anchor motifs. various experimental approaches, e.g., cell fractionation, percoll gradient purification, and solubilization of the cm, demonstrated that the fusion proteins are tightly bound to the cm and do not form aggregates. trypsin digestion, as well as electron microscopy of immunogold-labeled replicas, confirmed that the protein was localized on the outside surface. the displayed sak showed functional activity, indicating correct folding. this membrane surface display system features endotoxin-poor organisms and can provide a novel platform for numerous applications.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (ubts) at intervals for up to 144 h. ofloxacin showed higher  concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. the median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug  administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. the ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were  still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens  for which the mics of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: escherichia coli atcc 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively;  pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. generally, the ubts for  gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the ubts for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. according to the ubts, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (mics, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.

TI  == dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  == dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within duws. these methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. in order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. there are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. however, the food and drug administration have not approved all products currently on the market. our evaluation of zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use  and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. it is also economical  and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the duws was free from any viable microorganisms. this effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. the elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the duws  was performed. although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of duws following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. finally, the product can be  delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. from our study, zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. based on the research that  has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. a combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality  dental treatment water. independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ada, osap, and cdc guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. it is expected that  in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems  and products to deal with this issue. until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in duws.

AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == [effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == the influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine t.
AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == an intelligent rapid odour recognition model in discrimination of helicobacter pylori and other gastroesophageal isolates in vitro.
AB  == two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. in the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees c), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., h. pylori, enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), mixed infection  (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and e. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (nn). the nn prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. successful clustering of bacterial  classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (da) of a normalised subset of sensor data. cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. in the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees c, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of h. pylori cultures in enriched (hpp) and normal (hp) media and 11 samples over sterile (n)  cultures. forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer nn previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (ga). ga-nn analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform da-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. it is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour  generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian  olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of ga-nns and multivariate techniques.

TI  == influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  == the available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. in this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. bacterial counts  were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. a total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. an increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage  being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of s. aureus. the largest average growth increase was obtained with e. coli. the largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with s. marcescens. our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced  by humen wet cerumen. in vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  == background: ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (oe), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (aom-tt) and chronic suppurative otitis media (csom). the quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. methods: a survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of  quinolone otic products for oe, aom-tt and csom. results: oe: floxin otic and cortisporin tc otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. csom: ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter spp.  aom-tt: ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa conclusions: in each of the studies of oe, csom and aom-tt, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to cortisporin for children with oe; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with aom-tt who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients  with csom.

TI  == resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  == multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. among gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. important causes of gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation  cephalosporin (amp c) beta-lactamase resistance among enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. in selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should  not further promote the development of resistance. recent data suggest that because of esbls and high-level amp c beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. in addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. the role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. in addition, several new agents with good  activity against gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.

TI  == acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute  otitis media are treated with antibiotics. methods: a multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. setting: nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. results: prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. cultures were negative in 60 patients. the organisms isolated  in the 92 positive cultures were: streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), haemophilus influenzae (four patients), proteus mirabilis (two patients), escherichia coli (two patients), klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient),  enterobacter (one patient), acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative  bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). ten patients had mixed flora. sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). conclusions: antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. the distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates against a new aminoglycoside isepamicin.
AB  == background and objectives: isepamicin is a new aminoglycoside with a spectrum of  activity similar to amikacin with an advantage of possessing a high level of stability against different aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. the in vitro susceptibility of nosocomial isolates obtained from patients admitted to the all  india institute of medical sciences, new delhi during october-december, 1999 was  tested against isepamicin and compared with other aminoglycosides. methods: a total of 251 clinical isolates were studied which included escherichia coli 87, klebsiella pneumoniae 54, pseudonomas aeruginosa 38, staphylococcus aureus 27 (methicillin resistant s. aureus 15, methicillin sensitive s. aureus 12), acinetobacter species 26, enterobacter aerogenes 9, proteus mirabilis 5, proteus  vulgaris 2, and citrobacter species 3. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against isepamicin and other aminoglycosides including amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin was done using nccls guidelines. the cut-off values of  isepamicin were used as that of amikacin. results: we found that overall 153 nosocomial isolates were sensitive to isepamicin as compared to 95 for amikacin in this hospital. isepamicin showed a superior in vitro activity compared to the  other aminoglycosides tested. interpretation and conclusions: isepamicin can be a good alternative in multidrug resistant nosocomial isolates in hospitals where amikacin resistance is emerging.

TI  == assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen  growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.

TI  == respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  == although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. it has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (ccf) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (doc) subjects (pii 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). while no subjects in the doc group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the ccf subjects were found to be colonized. oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in ccf subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and higher plaque scores. these results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of copd may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.

AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections in france. multicentre study group.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial strains isolated from adults with community-acquired urinary tract infections (uti) in france. from december 1996 to march 1997, each of 15 private laboratories in france consecutively collected  about 80 non-duplicate strains isolated from adult outpatients with uti, including patients receiving care at home, and tested their susceptibility by the disk diffusion test. a total of 1160 strains were collected: 1031 gram-negative bacilli, including escherichia coli (n = 865), proteus mirabilis (n = 68) and klebsiella spp. (n = 40), and 129 gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), other staphylococci (n = 25), group b streptococci (n = 25) and  enterococci (n = 63). in the case of 430 bacterial isolates, the patients had either been hospitalised in the last 6 months or received antibiotic treatment in the last 3 months. the antibiotic susceptibility rates for escherichia coli were: amoxicillin (58.7%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (63.3%), ticarcillin (61.4%), cephalothin (66.8%) cefuroxime (77.6%), cefixime (83.6%), cefotaxime (99.8%), ceftazidime (99%), nalidixic acid (91.9%), norfloxacin (96.6%), ofloxacin (96.3%), ciprofloxacin (98.3%), cotrimoxazole (78.2%), fosfomycin (99.1%) and gentamicin (98.4%). of the enterobacteriaceae, five strains produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. methicillin resistance was detected in nine staphylococcus aureus isolates. the most important findings were two extended-spectrum, beta-lactamase-producing and three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients who had not been hospitalised in the last 6 months or taken antibiotics in the last 3 months. the  findings indicate that these strains can spread within the community; therefore,  monitoring antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the community appears to be mandatory.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, gar-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth  or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

TI  == [the resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  == clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. the resistance of 50  strains each of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus sp. (p. mirabilis 25 strains and p. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (isp), amikacin (amk), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against p. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. isp was effective against all strains except for 14% of mrsa, 2% of proteus sp., and 4% of p. aeruginosa. 2. six strains of mrsa were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases isp exhibited a relatively  low minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) compared to the other compounds. 3. four strains of mrsa were resistant to all drugs except isp. mrsa was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. twenty-one strains of mrsa and 1 strain of p. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both isp and amk. 5. against all strains tested, isp generally exhibited a lower mic compared to amk. these results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, isp is still an aminoglycoside having a  high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == investigation of plants used in jamaican folk medicine for anti-bacterial activity.
AB  == we have started a systematic scientific study of folklore medicinal plants currently used as alternative medicine in jamaican society. in this initial study, extracts of plants widely used by the islanders are studied for antibacterial activity against five common pathogens; streptococcus group a, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia  coli. these studies revealed that 25% (approx.) of the plant extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes used. subsequent to these observations, extracts from mikania micrantha were examined in detail. this led to the isolation of two sesquiterpenoids, mikanolide and dihydromikanolide, with activity against s. aureus and c. albicans. the results suggest that traditional folk medicine could be used as a guide in our continuing search for new natural products with potential medicinal properties.

AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the direct influence of cigarette smoke on the bacterial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and the effect of supplementary vitamin e on the colonization of instilled bacteria into the trachea of rats that do not have the chronic airway pathology associated with smoking. methodology: thirty male wistar albino rats, weighing approximately 250 g, were used as experimental animals. a 0.1 ml bacterial suspension containing six bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenza, peptostreptococci spp.), isolated previously from pharynx  of rats, were instilled into the trachea of three groups of rat (10 control, 10 cigarette smoke-treated and 10 cigarette smoke- and vitamin e-supplemented rats). the smoke-treated rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 3 days prior to and after intratracheal instillation. the third group of rats were given vitamin e supplements (100 mg/kg per day). tracheobronchial lavage samples of all rats were quantitatively cultured after 3 days from the instillation. results: the colony numbers of isolated bacteria were significantly higher in cigarette smoke-treated rats than in the control group and in the smoke- and vitamin e-supplemented rats  (p < 0.05). only s. aureus and s. epidermidis were isolated from vitamin e-supplemented rats, while instilled all six bacterial species were isolated from the other two groups. conclusions: it is concluded that smoking impairs the elimination of bacteria or facilitates colonization of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract of rats. supplementary treatment with vitamin e reduces the effect of cigarette smoke; however, some bacteria may be resistant to this action of vitamin e.

AB  == the aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (hpmc) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of  the external eye. pure reference strain cultures of candida albicans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. serial twofold dilutions of 2% hpmc, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution  (0.85% nacl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. one hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. after 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. after 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. c. albicans and p. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. p. acnes and p. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. s. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of hpmc dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. s. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. the viability of p. aeruginosa in hpmc dilutions needs  to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of hpmc may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.

TI  == comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  == to compare the antibacterial activity of the australian tea tree oil (tto) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by gc-ms and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. the highest activity was obtained by tto, with mic values of 0.25% for enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella choleraesuis, shigella flexneri, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and s. xylosus. it is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than tto against gram-positive bacteria, with mic values of 0.12%. both tto and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.

TI  == aspects of the antimicrobial efficacy of grapefruit seed extract and its relation to preservative substances contained.
AB  == the antimicrobial efficacy as well as the content of preservative agents of six commercially available grapefruit seed extracts were examined. five of the six extracts showed a high growth inhibiting activity against the test germs bacillus subtilis sbug 14, micrococcus flavus sbug 16, staphylococcus aureus sbug 11, serratia marcescens sbug 9, escherichia coli sbug 17, proteus mirabilis sbug 47,  and candida maltosa sbug 700. in all of the antimicrobial active grapefruit seed  extracts, the preservative benzethonium chloride was detected by thin layer chromatography. additionally, three extracts contained the preserving substances  triclosan and methyl parabene. in only one of the grapefruit seed extracts tested no preservative agent was found. however, with this extract as well as with several self-made extracts from seed and juiceless pulp of grapefruits (citrus paradisi) no antimicrobial activity could be detected (standard serial broth dilution assay, agar diffusion test). thus, it is concluded that the potent as well as nearly universal antimicrobial activity being attributed to grapefruit seed extract is merely due to the synthetic preservative agents contained within. natural products with antimicrobial activity do not appear to be present.

TI  == in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant spanish clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. isolates were selected when their mic to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). the following strains were tested: 61 escherichia coli, 12 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 proteus mirabilis, 21 serratia marcescens, 4 enterobacter cloacae, 21 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 enterococcus spp. clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using mueller-hinton agar according to nccls recommendations. of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. the percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for e. coli, 75% for k. pneumoniae, 71.4% for p. mirabilis, 28.6% for s. marcescens, 75% for e. cloacae, 33.3% for p. aeruginosa, 90.5% for s. aureus and  40% for enterococcus spp. clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. it was particularly active against s. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus and streptococcus pneumoniae) and five gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. the coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microm. this study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. while coumarins with a methoxy function at c-7 and, if present, an oh group at either the c-6 or c-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (gram-negative microorganisms including the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus), the  presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae). a combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one  additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.

TI  == macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris.
AB  == a cdna encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant african snail achacina fulica ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rach) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kda. carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rach was composed  of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol n-acetylglucosamine residues. antimicrobial activity  using escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus showed that the rach had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. the rach showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rach inhibited the growth of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis in addition to e. coli and s. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus. the rach was also effective in preventing growth of vibrio anguillarum and vibrio parahaemolyticus. the results suggested that the rach had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of acetic acid and burow's solution as topical otological preparations.
AB  == at present there are no topical otological preparations on the world health organisation's essential drug list, largely due to the ototoxic potential of preparations containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. acetic acid and burow's solution have long been used in the treatment of the discharging ear. the aim of  this study was to ascertain the antibacterial activity of these two preparations  against the most commonly occurring bacteria isolated from discharging ears in our department. twenty fresh isolates of each of the following organisms--pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes--were plated onto blood agar and tested against one per cent, two per cent and three per cent acetic acid and burow's solution (13 per cent aluminium acetate). the activity of each agent was ascertained by the size of the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth. burow's solution showed significantly larger average zones of inhibition than acetic acid (p < 0.001). the two per cent and three per cent acetic acid as well as the burow's solution were active against all the organisms tested.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. in general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. the initial introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an  important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. subsequently, the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and bacampicillin) were developed  because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum initially included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella, salmonella, listeria, haemophilus, and neisseria. the search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin and ticarcillin)  and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, and piperacillin). finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam) and an aminopenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra by inhibiting certain beta-lactamases (non-group 1) of resistant bacteria. the development of an ideal penicillin that  is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, and resistant to beta-lactamases and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.

TI  == penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  == background: a prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. methods: cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. in application mode i, patients received on the day  before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. in application mode ii, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees c. the hplc method was used for measuring the concentration. results: the highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. in this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). these mean concentration are all above the mic90 of gram-negative bacteria like proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. in some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: the mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the mic90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == the antibacterial effects of tumescent liposuction fluid.
AB  == tumescent liposuction is currently one of the most commonly performed aesthetic procedures. despite the variable use of preoperative antibiotics, infection is uncommon. prior works suggest that the low incidence of infection may be due to lidocaine's antibacterial properties. however, these properties have only been demonstrated using concentrations of lidocaine above 0.8%, significantly higher than those used in tumescent liposuction. the purpose of this study was to determine if the commonly used tumescent fluid containing 0.1% lidocaine, 1:1000,000 epinephrine, and 0.012 meq sodium bicarbonate possesses antibacterial  activity. using the broth microdilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus were determined after exposure to either lidocaine, epinephrine, bicarbonate, or the combination  of all three agents. to determine if there were significant growth differences not detectable by the broth microdilution method, bacterial concentrations were obtained through the use of a spectrophotometer, and significant differences from the controls were calculated by one-way analysis of variance. to determine if prolonged exposure to the tumescent mix would alter bacterial growth, a killing time study was also undertaken. the results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration of lidocaine was not less than 0.5% for any of the bacteria, whereas the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of the combined solution was  0.25%. the lowest inhibitory concentration as determined by spectrophotometric analysis for the combined solution was 0.13% (p < 0.01). analysis of the killing  time data revealed no inhibition of bacterial growth over time. in conclusion, lidocaine, epinephrine, and bicarbonate do exhibit antibacterial properties at high concentrations. however, the commonly used tumescent mixture containing dilute concentrations of these agents does not significantly inhibit the growth of commonly encountered bacteria.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == clinical trial of ototopical ofloxacin for treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  == a multicenter, open-label prospective trial was performed to determine the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of ofloxacin (oflx) otic solution in the treatment of subjects > or =12 years with chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) and a chronically perforated tympanic membrane in the infected ear(s). a total of 207 patients at 27 centers in the united states and central america received oflx 0.5 ml instilled ototopically twice daily for 14 consecutive days. the primary clinical end point was cure (dry ear) or failure (not dry ear). the primary microbiologic end point was eradication of baseline pathogens. because there was  no comparator and there were few data in the literature regarding clinical efficacy in patients treated with other regimens, the efficacy of oflx was compared with data recorded in the clinical records of historical-practice control (hpc) or current-practice control (cpc) subjects. the incidence of clinical cure in clinically evaluable oflx-treated patients (91%; 148 of 162 subjects) was significantly higher than in hpc subjects (67%; 124 of 185 subjects) or cpc subjects (70%; 38 of 54 subjects). oflx eradicated all baseline  pathogens isolated in microbiologically evaluable subjects. these pathogens were  predominantly staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis. the most common treatment-related adverse event, bitter taste, occurred in 17% (35 of 207) of oflx-treated subjects. thus oflx 0.5 ml administered twice daily for 14 days was effective in resolving the signs and symptoms of csom in subjects > or =12 years, was significantly more effective than therapies used to treat hpc or cpc subjects, and was well tolerated.

TI  == activities of ll-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  == human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (hnp-1 to hnp-4) and the alpha-helical peptide ll-37. we used radial diffusion assays and an improved national committee for clinical laboratory standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of ll-37, hnp-1, and protegrin (pg-1). although generally less potent than pg-1, ll-37 showed considerable activity (mic, <10 microgram/ml) against pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mm nacl. certain organisms (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, proteus mirabilis, and candida albicans) were resistant to ll-37 in media that contained 100 mm nacl but were susceptible in low-salt media. burkholderia cepacia was resistant to ll-37,  pg-1, and hnp-1 in low- or high-salt media. ll-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of e. coli ml-35p. chromogenic limulus assays revealed that ll-37 bound to e. coli o111:b4 lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a high affinity and  that this binding showed positive cooperativity (hill coefficient = 2.02). circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that ll-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid a, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. the broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of ll-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hcap-18) may protect skin and other tissues  from bacterial intrusions and lps-induced toxicity. the potent activity of ll-37  against p. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.

TI  == a rapid method for determination of in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics with a bulk acoustic wave bacterial growth biosensor.
AB  == a novel bulk acoustic wave (baw) bacterial growth biosensor was developed to study in vitro susceptibility by continuous monitoring of disturbances of bacterial growth at low antibiotic concentrations, followed by the accurate and rapid estimation of growth kinetic parameters and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics). the susceptibilities of bacteria, e.g. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, pr. morganii and pr. mirabilis, to various antibiotics, e.g. penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin and cefotaxime, were investigated, respectively, and the mics were rapidly determined with a higher reproducibility than the conventional broth micro-dilution technique (bmdt). the effects of cell constant of conductivity electrode, ph and temperature on bacterial growth and biosensor signals were discussed in detail. the proposed method offers an effective alternative to the conventional methods.

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis inhibit the perinuclear but not the circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody reaction.
AB  == background: perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-anca) are found  in 48%-83% of serum samples from patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). their pathogenic role and initiating stimuli are unknown. in contrast to patients with  vasculitides and anca reactivities, the antibodies in uc patients do not react with myeloperoxidase (mpo) or proteinase 3 (pr3). the aim of the present study was to investigate whether bacterial species of the intestinal tract and other sources could interfere with p-anca in sera from patients with uc. methods: seventeen p-anca-positive and anti-mpo-negative serum samples from patients with  uc were tested with escherichia coli 014 and staphylococcus aureus wood 46. six of these serum samples with different p-anca titres were selected to test further the influence of 15 different gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial strains. six anti-mpo positive p-anca, 5 anti-pr3 positive c-anca, and 10 antinuclear antibody (ana)-positive serum samples were used as controls. the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ancas) were analysed by an indirect immunofluorescence method (iif) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils, and the anas were tested by iif on hep-2 cells or rat liver tissues. the bacteria used in the experiments were either live or killed by formalin or glutaraldehyde fixation or heated at 80 degrees c for 30 min. the test was first performed as a bacterial absorption test with sedimented organisms and then at various temperatures with the supernatant from suspension of live bacteria. results: both mpo-positive and mpo-negative p-anca reactivity was abolished by absorption of patient sera with live e. coli and proteus mirabilis but not with bacteria representing members of 10 other species, suggesting that antibody reactivity was absorbed away. however, continued experiments indicated that the inhibition of p-anca was not due to classic antigen-antibody interactions but rather to decomposition of the antigenic substrate of the neutrophils by factors present in the supernatants of  live e. coli and p. mirabilis. the activity of the supernatant was temperature-dependent, with strong activity at room temperature and 37 degrees c, no activity at 0 degrees c, and abolished by mild heat treatment (56 degrees or 60 degrees c). no activity was shown in the supernatants from bacteria treated with formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. conclusions: soluble material from live e. coli and p. mirabilis has the capacity to decompose the antigenic substrate of neutrophils responsible for both mpo-positive and mpo-negative p-anca, most probably brought about through enzymatic activity. anti pr3-positive c-anca were  not affected, which suggests substrate specificity of the proposed enzymatic activity.

TI  == microbiologic evaluation of cutaneous wounds in hospitalized dermatology patients.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to identify predictability of wound flora which may  be helpful in the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy of wound infections while awaiting the results of bacterial cultures. toward this end, results of an  ongoing microbiologic surveillance of skin wound flora in hospitalized dermatology patients are presented. bacterial isolates cultured from patients with skin wounds admitted to a tertiary care dermatology inpatient unit were evaluated and comparison was made to a previous survey of the same inpatient service done in 1992. microbiologic evaluation of superficial skin wounds, leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers showed that staphylococcus aureus was the principal isolate in superficial wounds (77%) compared to the equal prevalence of s. aureus (43%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (42%) cultured from leg ulcers. cultures from pressure ulcers grew proteus mirabilis as the dominant isolate. these data agree  with previous surveillance data from the same inpatient base performed in 1992 and support the relatively predictable wound flora cultured from skin wounds in our hospital inpatient unit over the 4 years surveillance period. this predictability can enhance empiric antibiotic selection for wound infections while awaiting the results of bacterial culture, and supports the value of local  microbiologic surveillance programs in the management of wound infections.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == bacteraemia in the elderly.
AB  == the aims of the study were to describe community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia in elderly patients and to determine the factors associated with increased mortality in these patients attending a tertiary hospital in singapore. a consecutive series of 191 patients aged more than 60 years of age admitted in 1995 was studied retrospectively. all of them had positive blood culture results  obtained from the department of pathology and the case notes were reviewed and entered into a standard clinical protocol. they were analysed for age, sex, place of origin, race, sites of infection, clinical parameters and bacteriology. the mean age of the study population was 75 years (sd = 8.9 years). bacteraemia was acquired from the community in 57.5% of patients, 33% was nosocomial in origin and 9.5% acquired it in chronic long term care facilities. the common organisms cultured in community-acquired infections were escherichia coli (26.1%), klebsiella species (25.4%), streptococcus species (11.1%), methicillin sensitive  staphylococcus aureus (7.6%) and proteus mirabilis (4.8%). the common organisms cultured in nosocomial infections were klebsiella species (19.8%), enterobacter species (14.6%), e. coli (11.8%), acinetobacter baumanii (9.2%), methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). whilst most cases of bacteraemia were single organism cultures, 13.5% were polymicrobial. the common sources of bacteraemia were chest (27.5%), urinary tract (24.5%), skin (12.5), hepatic (8.8%), gut (4.3%), cardiovascular system (1%) and others (3.6%). in 12.5% of cases, the sources were multiple and in 5.3% of cases, the source could not be identified. twenty-one per cent of patients with bacteraemia died. the following factors were associated with increased mortality rate: older age (median age of those that died was 78.5 years compared to survivors with a median age of 73 years, p = 0.011), patient's place  of origin (patients in nursing home at higher risk of death, p = 0.04), patient's mobility status (immobile patients at higher risk, p = 0.00297), source of bacteraemia--respiratory infection at increased risk of death (p = 0.00009) but urinary tract infection had a better survival rate (p = 0.03935) and multiple sites of infection (patients with multiple sites of infection had higher risk, p  = 0.00897). methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was associated with a mortality rate of 35.3%, followed by klebsiella species 28.6%,  pseudomonas aeruginosa 28.6%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 25%, proteus mirabilis 25% and e. coli 19.1%. important clinical parameters which indicated a poor clinical outcome were: high pulse rate, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, low total white cell count, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia and  increased creatinine level.

TI  == [urinary bacteria in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and low levels of daily activity].
AB  == the results of bacteria isolated from the urine of inactive elderly patients with urinary incontinence in 1982, 87, 93 and 95 were compared and the chronological changes of urinary bacteria were analyzed. the following results were obtained: (1) the most common bacteria isolated from the patients in 1995 were d-group enterococcus, followed by providencia rettgeri, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. it is thought that the main cause of the more frequent isolation of enterococcus is an abuse of cephems and fecal contamination. (2) the most common bacteriaisolated from the patients who were managed with an indwelling urethral catheter were proteus and providencia species, and their incidence tended to decrease from 1982 to 1995. (3) infection with pseudomonas species tended to increase, as did that staphylococcus species, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and then decreased. based on these findings, it is important to assess and treat dysuria before inserting an indwelling urethral catheter, and to select an antibacterial agent that is effective in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and limited activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a spanish multicenter study.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. according to the nccls breakpoints, enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. more than 90.0% of the escherichia coli and citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, enterobacter spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. in general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (utis) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated utis. more than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from utis, except for p. aeruginosa (31.8%) and acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. the results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of  side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated utis.

TI  == the role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. because of perceived limitations against streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the  treatment of chronic otitis media where p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic  bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. recently published guidelines in canada, usa and great britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring icu admission. a quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. for patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. in the absence of p. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.

AB  == the major (26 kda) autolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative electrophoresis, ion-exchange, and dye-ligand chromatographies. this purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing peptidoglycan. the pl of the 26-kda autolysin was determined to be between 3.5 and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for activity. the autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli indicating it to be a beta-glycosidase. it was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from gram-positive bacteria and the o-acetylated peptidoglycans from either proteus mirabilis or staphylococcus aureus. the n-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be his-glu-pro-pro-gly. the 26-kda autolysin together with a 29-kda autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal growth, but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth supernatants.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == [the photometric determination of the antilysozyme activity of microorganisms].
AB  == the method for the determination of the antilysozyme activity (ala) of microorganisms, based on the photometric determination of the residual activity of enzyme with the use of micrococcus lysodeikticus test culture after the incubation of the strain under test and lysozyme, is proposed. the new method enhances the reliability of the determination of the ala of microorganisms due to an increase in the accuracy of the quantitative determination of ala. the elimination of the stage of interaction between the growing bacterial culture and lysozyme and the presence of the antilysozyme factor in the supernatant fluid confirm the constructive and secretory character of antilysozyme activity.

TI  == multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media in adults. the french study group.
AB  == chronic suppurative otitis media is a common and potentially dangerous clinical condition that is difficult to treat because the most common infecting organisms  are often resistant to many antibiotics. recently, fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin have provided a new therapeutic possibility, offering a wide range  of antibacterial activity and proven concentration in the middle ear. therefore in the current study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of suppurative chronic otitis media in adults. one hundred sixty-four patients were enrolled during a 3-month period by 49 ear, nose, and throat physicians in general practice. the mean duration of symptoms was 158 months, with the acute exacerbation lasting 72.5 days. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were most commonly isolated. at the end of treatment, the otorrhea had disappeared in  104 of the 155 (67.1%) evaluated patients. the bacteriologic eradication rate was 64.5%. after 4 weeks of follow-up care, 93.2% of patients had no recurrence of infection. in 4 patients, treatment was discontinued prematurely after an adverse event. we conclude that ciprofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated general  practice treatment for suppurative chronic otitis media in adults.

TI  == antimicrobial action of rabbit leukocyte cap18(106-137).
AB  == cap18 is a cationic antimicrobial protein originally isolated from rabbit neutrophils, of which a 32-mer sequence from its c-terminal and (cap18(106-137))  has been found to be the most active. the bactericidal action of this peptide has been characterized by conventional culture techniques and flow cytometry. cultures of escherichia coli nctc10418 were exposed to the mbc (12 microm) of the peptide for up to 60 min and stained with a fluorochrome sensitive to changes in  either membrane potential (bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol [dibac4(3)), or membrane integrity (propidium iodide [pi]) before flow cytometric analysis. addition of cap18(106-137) to e. coli in broth culture resulted in immediate collapse of membrane potential [as determined by uptake of dibac4(3)] and loss of membrane integrity (as indicated by uptake of pi), with a corresponding 6- to 8-log decrease in viable counts as determined by colony formation on solid media. in identical experiments, the presence of mg2+ (1 to 10 mm), k+ (50 to 250 mm), or edta (5 mm) or incubation in nutrient-free buffer or at 4 degrees c had no effect on peptide-induced dye uptake. in contrast, addition of ca2+ (1 to 10 mm) or the respiratory chain poison carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp) (50 microm) inhibited the uptake of both dyes. these findings, however, did not relate to bacterial recovery on solid media, where (unless in the presence of k+ 150 to 250 mm) cap18(106-137) at 12 microm fulfilled the mbc criteria (99.9% killing). we conclude that cap18(106-137) exerts a rapid and profound action on e. coli cytoplasmic membranes and viability as measured by colony formation. the results suggest, however, that cap18(106-137) may exert its action at sites additional to the cell membrane and  that its activity profile is unique among cationic antimicrobial proteins.

AB  == possible increasing of resistance to difuracil or n-(5-nitrofurfuryliden)-5-nitrofuran-2-(n'-acetyl) carboxamidohydrazon (pap-49) in staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp. and escherichia coli was studied and the level of the resistance increasing was determined by the method of 30-fold passage of the cultures in subbacteriostatic concentrations of the drug. it was shown in vitro that the increase of the resistance to the new nitrofuran was insignificant. the most intensive adaptation was observed during the first 10 passages. during the following 10-15 passages the susceptibility level remained unchanged (e.coli) or was even somewhat higher (s. aureus and streptococcus sp.). after that a new increase of the resistance was observed. the most marked changes in the susceptibility were detected in streptococcus sp. and the least marked in  staphylococcus sp. and e.coli. combinations of difuracil in subbacteriostatic concentrations with various antibacterial drugs provided both additive and synergistic effects with respect to s.epidermidis, s. pneumonase, e.coli and p.mirabilis. the most active combinations were those of difuracil with aminoglycoside antibiotics, penicillins or chloramphenicol.

TI  == is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

TI  == concentrations of ceftriaxone (1,000 milligrams intravenously) in abdominal tissues during open prostatectomy.
AB  == ceftriaxone concentrations in abdominal tissues were evaluated at different stages of open prostatectomy. ceftriaxone was administered as antibiotic prophylaxis, and 15 consecutive patients were given a single dose of ceftriaxone  (1,000 mg intravenously in 1 min) 30 min before surgery. ceftriaxone concentrations in tissue were determined at three stages of the surgical procedure; upon the opening of the abdominal cavity, during the prostatectomy, and upon the closure of the abdominal cavity. samples of the following tissues or sample were assayed: epiploic and abdominal-wall fat; retzius' space, bladder, and prostate tissue; and urine. during the different stages of the surgical procedure, for all patients, and in the different tested tissues, ceftriaxone concentrations greater than or equal to the cutoff point (4 micrograms/g of tissue) were measured. the highest concentrations were obtained in the bladder (43 +/- 18 micrograms/g) and in the prostate (35 +/- 18 micrograms/g). in fatty tissues, concentrations were between 13 +/- 5 and 22 +/- 8 micrograms/g. all patients (15 of 15) had ceftriaxone levels in tissue greater than the mics for the potential pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis). in conclusion, during open prostatectomy and  after the use of a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 mg), high antibiotic levels  were obtained throughout the surgical procedure in the tissues potentially involved in postoperative infection.

TI  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries.
AB  == visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis were investigated in 226 inpatients who sustained electrical burns over a period of 15 years. four patients who sustained thoracic and abdominal organ injuries were noted in this series. the patients had injuries of the small intestine, stomach, colon and the lung. all the patients received operative treatment. two of them died of sepsis. injuries to the internal organs should always be considered following high-voltage injuries, and they should be managed as early as possible. the data concerning wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries were evaluated in three  consecutive 5-year periods. over this period of 15 years, different antibiotic regimens were used for prophylaxis and treatment. most patients in the current series had been contaminated or infected by various pathogens prior to admission. long-lasting administration of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients showed  no improvement in controlling the sepsis. after 1987, most of the microorganisms  were eliminated following more effective antimicrobial therapy. the progressive decrease in infection frequency of species such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae, appeared to be causally related to the changes in the general therapeutic protocol which included new antibiotics. the infections caused by e. coli and staphylococcus aureus showed a rather steady state. a marked increase in frequency of negative wound cultures was also noted between the years 1989 and 1993. a gradual decrease in mortality rates was observed from the first to the last 5-year period, whereas mortality rates due to sepsis showed a gradual but slower decline. sepsis (142 patients comprising 62.8  per cent of the total mortality rate) was the most frequent complication resulting in death.

TI  == in-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  == driving while under the influence of alcohol (dui) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation  or suspension of driving privileges. the accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in  vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of dui. in this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees c for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, and candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (enterococcus sp., staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. the rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees c or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. many of these species were also able  to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by  fermentation.

TI  == etiology and therapy of chronic suppurative otitis.
AB  == infectious diseases of the ear are important in adults due to their incidence and relapses. we carried out a study of aerobic microorganisms on 251 otic exudates from patients diagnosed as having chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (119), chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma (85) and chronic external otitis (47). the microorganisms predominantly isolated were, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and other enterobacteriaceae. 86% of isolates were monomicrobial and 14% of isolates were polymicrobial. in these latter the predominantly isolated microorganisms were also p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, corynebacterium spp. and proteus mirabilis. p. aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated and showed the highest percentages of resistance against antimicrobial agents tested. p. aeruginosa was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin  and imipenem, but much less susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. s. aureus was highly sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and teichoplanin. 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin g and ampicillin.

AB  == this study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. these include 56 paucibacillary (pb) and 73 multibacillary (mb) cases.  thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. the non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically pb leprosy (tt/bt/i) patients were: (1) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus(1), staphylococcus  albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: bacillus subtilis(1), corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(1), proteus mirabilis(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). the isolates from clinically mb leprosy (bb/bl/ll) patients were: (a) gram-positive cocci: micrococci(1), staphylococcus aureus(1) and staphylococcus albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1); corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1). (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and proteus mirabilis(2). the specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. these were (a) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus albus(2), staphylococcus aureus(2) and micrococci(2); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1), bacillus subtilis(2), corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(3), proteus vulgaris(1) and proteus mirabilis(1). while these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and pb/mb types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out  subtypes if any.

AB  == there is currently an unrecognized chapter in medical illnesses, occurring in living human beings, that defies recognition in explaining the diseases' origin and growth, and failing accurately to account for the pathophysiology involved. it is pertinent, therefore, to alert medical science, based upon facts as uncovered by my research studies (1-5), that plant bacterial spores can exist as  a separate entity systemically. being totally devoid of the presence of their adult origin, they can survive with a degree of viability. ultimately, they may become embedded within, or nearby, a network of cells, consisting of the reticuloendothelial, squamous, or epithelial group. with an ensuing adequate but  compatible circulating flow of blood by the host to the specific tissue site as muscles, bone, or bone marrow, it can thus lead to the various pathophysiological changes and illnesses that currently defy an accountable recognition.

AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

TI  == bacterial contamination in soft contact lens wearers.
AB  == we prospectively analyzed bacterial contamination in 15 soft contact lens wearing subjects. contact lenses, cases, tips of saline solution bottles, and conjunctiva were cultured. cultures were positive for 13 subjects (86.6%). contamination was  present in 13 contact lens cases (86.6%), 12 contact lenses (80.0%), nine saline  solution bottles (60.0%), and in the conjunctiva of three patients (20.0%). gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis) were the most frequently isolated organisms. staphylococcus aureus was the only gram-positive organism isolated. we discuss the possible sources of contamination, and emphasize the importance of contact lens care instruction.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == [susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  == using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. the bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), rhodococcus equi (n = 4), pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and escherichia coli (n = 3). in addition, two isolates  of enterobacter spp. and one isolate of streptococcus equisimilis, staphylococcus intermedius, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens were examined. for determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were fixed as limiting values: trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. as expected, rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. however, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. according to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.

TI  == [phenotypes of resistance to antibiotics of the most frequently isolated strains  in five specialized hospital centers. multicenter study].
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of 948 bacterial strains isolated from varied samples essentially proceeding from urinary infections in five paris psychiatric hospitals was determined by disk diffusion method. e. coli, p. mirabilis, klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa et s. aureus are the predominant bacteria. 40% of  s. aureus are methicilline resistant. enterobacteriaceae are progressively becoming resistant to aminopenicillines, but remain sensitive to third generation cephalosporines. they are still susceptible to first generation quinolones. at least, if no resistance of p. aeruginosa to imipeneme has been reported, 30% of strains are resistant to ciprofloxacine. resistance phenotypes to antibiotics of  the strains isolated in patients from psychiatric hospitals are located between those observed in out patients and in patients from general hospitals. however, we noticed a worrying evolution of resistance to those encontered in psychiatric  hospitals. therefore, a multiresistant strains emergence monitoring must be carried out regulary.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. hybrids secreting mabs specific for p. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from p. pseudomallei, p. cepacia, p. aeruginosa, p. putida, p. alcaligenes, xanthomonas maltophilia, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, s. krefeld, s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. of the six specific clones, clone 5f8, which was igm-producing and which reacted with all 56 p. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. results obtained from the indirect elisa against various p. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5f8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. the antibody could be readily used to identify p. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. the antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect elisa that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.

TI  == in vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  == many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. it has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary ph, with consequent stone formation. unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g.  escherichia coli). it has been recently reported that e. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. this study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and micrococcus luteus. subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (p < 0.003) reduce the uk activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. the urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, m. luteus, was, however,  the exception (p = 0.1079). in contrast to s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and m. luteus (p < 0.0213), p. mirabilis and s. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase  activity (p < 0.4047). these results may explain why proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. according to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. these conditions may lead to renal stone formation. an increase in urinary ph resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. it is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double  role in renal stone formation.

TI  == [antimicrobial and sporicidal efficacy of various disinfectant solutions].
AB  == the often indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents has led to increased bacterial resistance over the past years. this phenomenon is above all evident in nosocomial environments but also at a community level. it is therefore important  that, in addition to the rational use of antibiotics, an accurate prophylaxis is  performed which includes the correct use of disinfectants. this study examines the antimicrobial activity of various commercially available disinfectant solutions consisting of one or more active ingredients. an analysis of the results reveals that products consisting of an association of individual components (quaternary ammonium chloride with o-phenylphenol and/or isopropyl alcohol; chlorhexidine with benzalkonium chloride or with diazolidinylurea and isopropanol) demonstrate a greater efficacy in terms of microbicidal concentration and contact times.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (abk) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the abk disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied. in addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of abk. the 4 category system used in japan, and  the system proposed by the japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy were studied. in this study, mics were determined using the mueller-hinton agar containing 50 mg/l of ca and 25 mg/l of mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml.  mic90 values of abk against staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. those against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris,  enterobacter spp., and citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. mic90 values against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. the disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the showa disk manual. the inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with mics. results of abk disk susceptibility test with 30,  10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, p < 0.01). in the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in mic values of abk proposed are (+ + +) mic < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) mic > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) mic > 50 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. with 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. in the break point classification system of japanese society for antimicrobial chemotherapy, the mic break point for abk proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. it appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with mic values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. a pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for abk (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of abk reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

AB  == a total of 30 ejaculates has been tested for ejaculate volume, spermatozoal concentration, motility, agglomeration, agglutination and contamination by microorganisms. after that the ejaculate has been washed twice and transferred in the dr. wangs tube which was filled with medium before. after an incubation time  of 90 minutes very quickly moving spermatozoan could be observed through the microscope in the upper part (c-d) of the tube. after the tube was cut by means of a special glasscutter the motility of the containing spermatozoans of part c-d has been determined again, followed by a second bacteriological examination of the so prepared ejaculate. the results of sperm preparation with the dr. wangs tube regarding the sperm motility has been very good (85.7% of the sperm samples  showed a motility rate of 90% or even more after treatment). the bacteriological  examination has been satisfactory: in 77.7% of the cases all existing sperm bacterias has been eliminated by preparation in the dr. wangs tube. among other microorganisms escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus which are considered to be pathologic could be isolated from five of the ejaculates and have been removed after treatment with the dr. wangs tube. the handling of the tube was rather demanding and technically problematic. there has  been caused glass-splinters by cutting the tube which got visible while observing the ejaculate-medium-liquid through the microscope. their sizes were nearly equivalent to the size of a sperms head or even bigger. if the so prepared ejaculate would be used for insemination and in-vitro fertilisation the very small splinters may destroy the success of the treatment and should be avoided or removed. the dr. wangs tube offers a new modified swim-up technique for sperm preparation and is able to produce a high quality, nearly sterile sperm sample. because of the technical deficiency of the system, the high purchase and running  costs and the very small output (sperm sample volume, number of spermatozoans) the dr. wangs tube is not be recommended for the reproductive medicine in its present shape.

AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == infection and antibiotic therapy in 4000 burned patients treated in milan, italy, between 1976 and 1988.
AB  == the pathogenic flora, isolated from burn wounds of patients admitted to a burn care unit during the years between 1976 and 1988 were typed and the in vitro susceptibility to antibacterial agents was recorded. between 1976 and 1988 the general therapeutic approach was changed three times, in congruence with the prevalent nosocomial bacterial resistance. the most frequent isolates were: pseud. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp., proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella spp. and other enterobacteriaceae, such as acinetobacter, citrobacter. the most striking finding was the increase in antibiotic-resistant enterococcus isolates. staph. aureus, klebsiella and e. cloacae showed susceptibility to cephalosporins, imipenem, pefloxacin, vancomycin; enterococcus susceptibility to pefloxacin and vancomycin, and pseud. aeruginosa sensitivity to piperacillin, amikacin, tobramycin was generally good. e. coli showed a satisfactory susceptibility on average, and p. mirabilis showed a good sensitivity to piperacillin, cephalosporins, amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam and imipenem. thus, the general bacterial flora and susceptibility have remained mostly unchanged over the years, with the conspicuous exception of enterococcus spp. and e. cloacae, which demonstrated a marked increase in incidence, with a concomitant dramatic decrease in the sensitivity of enterococcus spp. to antibiotics.

TI  == the toxicologic interactions resulting from inhalation of carbon black and acrolein on pulmonary antibacterial and antiviral defenses.
AB  == the goal of this study was to investigate whether coexposures to carbon black and acrolein result in a toxicologic interaction having effects on lung defenses against infectious agents. this aim was accomplished through in vivo studies with inhalation challenges of infectious agents that probe the functional integrity of the multicomponent system that comprises the integrated defenses of the lungs. staphylococcus aureus was used for the alveolar macrophage (am) surveillance phagocytic system, proteus mirabilis for the dual phagocytic system composed of ams and inflammatory polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), listeria monocytogenes  for the lymphokine-mediated arm of the acquired cellular immune response, and influenza a virus for the cytotoxic t-cell-mediated effector mechanism of cellular immunity. exposures of swiss mice to target concentrations of 10 mg/m3 of carbon black and 2.5 ppm acrolein for 4 hr/day for 4 days suppressed the intrapulmonary killing of s. aureus a day after exposure with a return to control levels by day 7. in contrast, the coexposure enhanced the intrapulmonary killing  of p. mirabilis which correlated with a significant increase in accessory phagocytic pmns recovered from the lungs. combined exposure to carbon black and acrolein also resulted in impaired elimination of l. monocytogenes and influenza  a virus from the lungs. neither exposure to carbon black alone nor exposure to acrolein alone had any effect on the functional integrity of lung defenses against the four infectious agents. these data demonstrate the effects of the toxicologic interaction of coexposures to an inert particle and acrolein on innate and acquired defenses of the lungs. the mechanism for the enhanced biologic effect may be that the carbon black particle acts as a carrier mechanism for acrolein to the deep lung.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of crude leaf extracts of acalypha wilkesiana.
AB  == water, ethanol, chloroform and hexane extracts of acalypha wilkesiana leaves were investigated for in vitro antimicrobial activities by agar-diffusion and tube-dilution techniques. the water and ethanol extracts inhibited the growth of  standard and local strains of bacteria and fungi including staphylococcus aureus, trichophyton rubrum, trichophyton mentagrophytes, candida albicans and aspergillus flavus. the aqueous extract did not exert any inhibitory action on klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis while the ethanol extract was active. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extracts ranged between 0.25 and 32  mg/ml, while the minimum cidal concentrations were between 1.0 and 64 mg/ml. the  aqueous extract was found to be static in action while the ethanolic extract was  uniformly cidal in effect.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == treatment of urinary tract infections with ciprofloxacin after renal transplantation.
AB  == as urinary tract infections in immunosuppressed renal transplant patients present a major therapeutic problem for clinicians in charge of renal units, the efficacy of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin in such cases was tested in this study. twenty-six patients, 16 women and 10 men, aged 20 to 56 years, who developed urinary tract infection (uti) from 6 months to 10 years after renal transplantation were included in the study. of these patients, 20 (77%) showed cystitis and/or prostatitis and 6 (23%) clinical symptomatology of acute or recurrent pyelonephritis. patients with obstructive uropathy were excluded. urine culture was positive for e. coli in 16/26 patients (61.5%) and for proteus mirabilis, klebsiella, staphylococcus aureus in 10/26 (38.5%). all patients were  given ciprofloxacin 250 mg x 2 daily for 10 days and the results of the treatment were compared to those of 60 nontransplant patients (controls) with uti. fourteen patients (54%) were completely cured and 10(38%) showed improvement, while the respective results in the controls were 68% (41/60) and 28%. relapses occurred in two patients, one in each group. serious side effects were not observed. it is concluded that ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe drug for the treatment of uti in renal transplant patients.

TI  == the penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  == we examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. we obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. these vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)90 of staphylococcus epidermidis, propionibacterium species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and haemophilus influenzae, as well as the mic70 of s. aureus and bacillus cereus. therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.

TI  == loracarbef. a review of its antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction for detection of leptospira spp. in clinical samples.
AB  == a sensitive assay for leptospira spp., the causative agent of leptospirosis, was  developed on the basis of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a 331-bp sequence  from the leptospira interrogans serovar canicola rrs (16s) gene was amplified, and the pcr products were analyzed by dna-dna hybridization by using a 289-bp fragment internal to the amplified dna. specific pcr products also were obtained  with dna from the closely related nonpathogenic leptospira biflexa but not with dna from other spirochetes, such as borrelia burgdorferi, borrelia hermsii, treponema denticola, treponema pallidum, spirochaeta aurantia, or more distant organisms such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and proteus mirabilis. the assay was able to detect as few as 10 bacteria. leptospira dna was detected in urine from experimentally infected mice. in addition, the test was found to be suitable for diagnosing leptospirosis in humans. cerebrospinal fluid and urine from patients with leptospirosis were positive, whereas samples from control uninfected patients were negative.

TI  == a novel electrical method for the prevention of microbial colonization of intravascular cannulae.
AB  == an electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. the device produced an electrical current (10 microa) in both carbon-impregnated and 'hydrocath' cannulae. in-vitro models  were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. the electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection  from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.

TI  == nonspecific reactions of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (tecra) for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods.
AB  == a staphylococcal enterotoxin visual immunoassay kit (tecra) has recently become commercially available. since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types a to e (sea to see) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. in this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of sea, seb, and sec in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar  to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of sea per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of seb per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of sec per ml. however, the tecra kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than staphylococcus aureus, such as enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. the substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees c, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel). the problem of false-positive results with the tecra kit could be resolved by heat treatment (2 min at 100 degrees c) or by cleanup procedures involving metal chelate affinity chromatography with copper chelate sepharose for 4 h before use  of the tecra kit.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == background: many third world countries may not have adequate facilities for rapid sensitivity testing of antibiotics as an aid to diagnosis and chemotherapy. it may therefore be valuable to relate bacterial carriage on the skin to type of work a person does. methods: given areas of skin in workers from 10 occupational  groups were sampled. the bacteria obtained were analyzed after growth on appropriate media. the sensitivity profiles of potential pathogens isolated from  these groups, as well as of those (staphylococcus aureus only) isolated from patients with certified infections, were carried out and the results were analyzed. results: staphylococcus aureus constituted the most widely and frequently isolated potential pathogen. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella species were also frequent colonizers of skin. there was a statistical relationship between work type and overall prevalence of bacteria on skin (p less than 0.01). most isolates of the work groups were highly sensitive to gentamicin  and cefuroxine but not to penicillin g, ampicillin, and trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole; isolates from infected persons were generally more resistant than were the community-acquired ones. conclusions: a relationship may exist between the types of bacteria carried on the skin and the type of work in which a person is engaged.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

AB  == fifteen patients who had sickle-cell disease and osteomyelitis (affecting thirty  bones) were treated with operative decompression and parenteral administration of antibiotics between 1973 and 1988. organisms were isolated on culture of specimens of bone from all fifteen patients. parenteral antibiotic therapy was continued for a minimum of six weeks after operative decompression. the osteomyelitis resolved in twenty-nine (97 per cent) of the thirty affected bones  after follow-up ranging from two to fifteen years. with their compromised immune  status and poor circulation of blood in bone, patients who have sickle-cell disease and osteomyelitis are prone to have complications. in our series, the complications included an adhesive pericapsulitis of the shoulder in two patients, avascular necrosis of the humeral head in one, and a pathological fracture of the femur in one. in four of the fifteen patients, chronic osteomyelitis persisted, but in three of the four, the infections of bone healed  six to fourteen months after the initial operative decompression. staphylococcus  aureus was isolated on culture of specimens of bone from eight to the fifteen patients; salmonella, from six; and proteus mirabilis, from one. although salmonella has been cited as the principal causative organism of osteomyelitis in patients who have sickle-cell disease, in our experience staphylococcus aureus was the most common infecting organism. therefore, salmonella may not be the most common cause of osteomyelitis associated with sickle-cell disease in all countries or in all areas of a particular country.

TI  == the penicillins.
AB  == the penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. in general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. the initial introduction of aqueous penicillin g for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an  important pharmacologic landmark. the emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactam [corrected] ring. subsequently, the aminopenicillins (such as ampicillin and amoxicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. their spectrum included escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella salmonella, listeria, haemophilus, and neisseria. the search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa  led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and temocillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and apalcillin). finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an aminopenicillin or ticarcillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra. the development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, resistant to beta-lactamase, and without inoculum effect and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, e-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. ro 09-1428 inhibited  group a streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group b, c  and g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for staphylococcus aureus ro 09-1428 had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and e-1040. against pseudomonas aeruginosa ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml,  and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, providencia, salmonella and shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. for most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae  ro 09-1428 had higher mics of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. anaerobes, enterococci and listeria monocytogenes were resistant to ro 09-1428. ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-2, staphylococcus aureus pc-1, moraxella catarrhalis bro-1, enterobacter p-99, pseudomonas aeruginosa sabath-abraham or klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-7 and tem-9. ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid ph.

TI  == use of gas liquid chromatography as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in the diagnosis of anaerobic cerebral abscess.
AB  == forty cases of cerebral abscesses were studied prospectively to establish the microbial agents implicated in these cases. chronic otitis media (14 patients, 35%), congenital heart disease (five patients, 12.5%),a and meningitis (five patients, 12.5%) were among the important predisposing factors. streptococcus (14 patients, 35%) was the most common causative pre-isolated, the predominant species being streptococcus milleri (11 patients, 27.5%). other organisms isolated included proteus mirabilis in six patients (15%) and staphylococcus aureus in five patients (12.5%). anaerobes (12 patients, 30%), predominantly bacteroides sp. (eight patients, 20%), played an important role in these cases, the majority of which were isolated in mixed cultures. gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of pus detected the presence of anaerobes in another 11 cases of cerebral abscess, in which cultures of anaerobes were negative. therefore, gas-liquid chromotography is useful as an adjunct to conventional bacteriological methods in providing a rapid and sensitive means of detecting anaerobes in pus obtained especially from patients who had received antibiotic therapy prior to hospitalization.

TI  == biofilm and scleral buckle-associated infections. a mechanism for persistence.
AB  == scleral buckle infections tend to be persistent as well as resistant to antimicrobial treatment. often, scleral buckle infections require removal of the  buckling elements for resolution. to determine if bacteria are able to persist on scleral buckles by elaborating a glycocalyx matrix or biofilm that offers protection against host defenses and antimicrobial treatment, the authors cultured 28 scleral buckle elements removed for infection and extrusion. bacteria were isolated from 18 elements (64%). the most frequently isolated bacteria were  staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (8), staphylococcus aureus (3), corynebacteria (3), mycobacterium chelonei (3), and proteus mirabilis (3). eleven (65%) of 17 buckles evaluated with scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of bacteria encased in biofilm. biofilm was demonstrated on the surfaces and ends of solid silicon elements. in the silicon sponges, biofilm also extended into the matrix of the sponges. the authors believe that bacterial production of biofilm offers an explanation for the persistence of scleral buckle infections and their ability to withstand antimicrobial treatment.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == suppression and recovery of the alveolar macrophage phagocytic system during continuous exposure to 0.5 ppm ozone.
AB  == short-term exposures to ozone (o3) are known to impair pulmonary antibacterial defenses and alveolar macrophage (am) phagocytosis in a dose-related manner. to determine the effect of prolonged o3 exposure, swiss mice were exposed continuously to 0.5 ppm o3. at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days, intrapulmonary killing was assessed by inhalation challenge with staphylococcus aureus or proteus mirabilis  and by comparing the number of viable bacteria remaining in the lungs at 4 h between o3-exposed and control animals. to evaluate the effects of o3 on the functional capacity of the ams, fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis was assessed. ozone exposure impaired the intrapulmonary killing of s. aureus at 1 and 3 days;  however, with prolonged exposure, the bactericidal capacity of the lungs returned to normal. this trend of an initial suppression followed by recovery was reflected in the phagocytic capacity of the ams. in contrast to s. aureus, when p. mirabilis was used as the challenge organism, o3 exposure had no suppressive effect on pulmonary bactericidal activity, which correlated with an increase in the phagocytic cell population in the lungs. morphologic examination of the lavaged macrophages showed that after 1 day of o3 exposure, the ams were more foamy, and contained significantly more vacuoles. there was also a significant increase in binucleated cells at 3 days. these studies demonstrate that continuous exposure to o3 modulates am-dependent lung defenses and points to the  importance of the challenge organism and exposure protocol in establishing the adverse effect of o3.

AB  == ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were  inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime  against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.

TI  == further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == it had already been shown with a single virulent strain (a42) of fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. the present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include bacillus cereus, klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include bacillus subtilis, 'bacteroides melaninogenicus', clostridium sporogenes, pasteurella haemolytica, and proteus mirabilis. the study also showed that five further virulent strains of f. necrophorum closely resembled a42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by escherichia coli. actinomyces (corynebacterium) pyogenes and s. aureus. one further strain (a6) of f. necrophorum resembled a42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by a. pyogenes, s. aureus, b. cereus and k. oxytoca but differed from it and the other  five strains in being only slightly affected by e. coli. this work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of f. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.

TI  == bacterial killing in vitro by abscess-derived neutrophils.
AB  == in the absence of antimicrobial therapy, bacteria such as bacteriodes fragilis, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis may persist within an intra-abdominal abscess in the presence of large numbers of neutrophils which, under optimal conditions in vitro, can readily phagocytose and kill the same bacterial strains. neutrophils taken from abscesses induced by gram-negative bacteria such as those  above contain viable organisms. on incubation in vitro in the presence of serum,  these neutrophils kill the bacteria phagocytosed in the abscess poorly, if at all, yet can readily kill organisms added in vitro. to determine possible mechanisms that might explain this, we examined the bactericidal activity in vitro of neutrophils from a range of abscesses induced by one or two species of bacteria plus an abscess-potentiating agent, bran. the organisms studied were b.  fragilis, e. coli, p. mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus. the killing in vitro of e. coli and p. mirabilis, engulfed within an abscess, was significantly less than that of the same organisms when they were added to the in-vitro assay. in contrast, the killing of s. aureus was similar, whether engulfed in vivo or in vitro. however, s. aureus was less susceptible to phagocytosis and killing in vitro than p. mirabilis or e. coli, and the killing of s. aureus during in-vitro  incubation of neutrophils that had engulfed the organism with in the abscess was  similar to that of the gram-negative bacteria engulfed within the abscess.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility response of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa to a set of antibiotics was investigated in a survey comprising 19,380 positive cultures over a period of 5 years in a large hospital environment. four out of the five species (p. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. the species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. through this analysis  it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. the longest period of oscillation was detected for s. aureus (38 months). k. pneumoniae and e. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and p. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.

TI  == colobronchial fistula: a rare complication of crohn's colitis.
AB  == a 29-yr-old white woman presented with chronic pneumonia in the left lower lobe and with left pleural effusion. she was known to have inflammatory bowel disease, but she was asymptomatic under maintenance treatment with 5-asa. she received numerous antibiotic regimens according to susceptibility testing of microorganisms cultured from sputum and bronchial lavage and on an empiric basis  was also given antituberculosis treatment, but there was no clinical improvement  or change in the chest radiographic findings. sputum was repeatedly examined and  yielded, among other organisms, clostridium inocuum, enterobacter, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. on one microscopic examination of sputum, the presence of feculent material was suspected. a subsequent gastrografin enema revealed a cologastric and colobronchial fistula between the splenic flexture of the colon and the greater curve of the stomach and the bronchial system. segmental resection of the colon and resection of the lower lobe of the left lung were performed. histologic findings of the resected colon were consistent with crohn's disease. after a long period of postoperative  recovery, the patient returned to good general health and well-being. to our knowledge, a colobronchial fistula caused by crohn's colitis has not been previously reported.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (gm), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (ags) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical  isolates obtained during a period of july-december 1989. 1. gm-resistant strains  were noted in 24% of staphylococcus aureus, 12% of enterobacter spp., 24% of serratia marcescens, 7% of morganella morganii and 26% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no gm-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. 2. a majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and a large number of gm-resistant strains of enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. gm showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of s. marcescens, m. morganii and p. aeruginosa. 3.  among all the isolates tested of s. marcescens, 24% were gm-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (tob)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (dkb)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (amk)-resistant, hence the incidence of gm-resistant strains was the lowest. this tendency was also observed with p. vulgaris. however, among p. aeruginosa, 26% were gm-resistant, 14% tob-resistant, 18% dkb-resistant and 22% amk-resistant, thus the incidence rate for gm-resistance was somewhat higher. these results suggest that different ags-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. comparing the ratio of  gm-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio  increased among s. aureus, while decreases were observed among enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in gm-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.

TI  == the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in st  thomas' hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  == we have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. among the gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. the enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to  the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. we have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. although  many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.

AB  == cefotiam hexetil is a pro-drug of cefotiam available for oral administration. to  evaluate cefotiam concentrations at the active site in skin and soft-tissue infections, drug levels in skin suction blister fluid (sbf), cantharides blister  fluid (cbf) and serum were determined. six healthy subjects received oral cefotiam 400 mg as cefotiam hexetil. on an other day 200 mg was injected intravenously. following the oral dose, the bioavailability of cefotiam was 45.5%, and the maximum concentration in serum of 2.6 mg.l-1 was obtained at 2.1 h. peak concentrations in both types of blister fluid (0.9 mg.l-1) were significantly lower than after the iv dose (sbf 1.4 mg.l-1, cbf 1.5 mg.l-1), and  the peak levels occurred later (3.3 versus 1.5 h in cbf). despite the delay, the  extent of penetration was about 100% following either mode of administration (sbf, iv dose 112%, oral dose 117%). the cefotiam level in skin blister fluids declined significantly more slowly than the serum level. following the oral dose, the mean terminal half life was serum 0.8 h, sbf 2.6 h and cbf 4.6 h. cefotiam concentrations in the blister fluids were close to the mic90 of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis and h. influenzae and exceeded the mic90 of streptococci, e. coli and proteus mirabilis. thus, the oral administration of cefotiam 400 mg t.i.d. should be curative in the majority of bacterial infections of the skin and soft-tissues.

AB  == for the first time, co(ii), ni(ii) and zn(ii) complexes have been synthesized involving an intermediate schiff base, indane-1,3-dione-2-imine-n-acetic acid the condensed product of ninhydrin and glycine. these coloured complexes were characterised by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, thermogravimetric analyses/differential thermal analysis, infrared, magnetic susceptibility, nmr and electronic spectral studies. mechanisms for their formation have been proposed. the experimental studies reveal that the complexes possess octahedral stereochemistry whereas the schiff base behaves as a monobasic tridentate ligand. a molecular structure for the metal complexes is also proposed. a comparative study of the antimicrobial activity of ninhydrin and the corresponding metal complexes against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and  streptococcus faecalis has been undertaken and the results are discussed.

TI  == [sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  == 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "c.s. virgen de la arrixaga" in murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. the common infection was significantly associated to staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus a group and neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens y pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter. we did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by e. coli and proteus mirabilis. these factors were associated  to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical  state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of kt3777, a new orally active carbacephem.
AB  == kt3777 is a novel carbacephem antibiotic structurally identical to cefaclor (ccl), except that the sulfur atom of position 1 of the cephem nucleus has been replaced by carbon. kt3777 was investigated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with ccl, cephalexin (cex) and amoxicillin. the mic50 of kt3777 ranged from 0.2 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. kt3777 possessed an antibacterial spectrum and potency similar to that of ccl. however, against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, kt3777 was about twice as active as ccl. kt3777 was more active than cex against all strains tested. killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of kt3777 at concentrations above the mic. kt3777 showed good affinity for penicillin-binding  proteins 1a, 1bs, 3 and 4 of e. coli nihj jc-2. the protective effect of kt3777 against systemic infections in mice was comparable to that of ccl with a few exceptions and about 3 to 7 times greater than that of cex. kt3777 also proved effective against localized infections such as acute pneumonia and ascending urinary tract infections in mice.

TI  == [bacteremia secondary to decubitus ulcer].
AB  == we have prospectively evaluated 16 episodes of bacteremia induced by decubitus ulcers. the most commonly isolated microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis. bacteremia was polymicrobial in 5 cases (31%). most ulcers were already present at the time  of admission, but bacteremia developed within the hospital in 13 patients. in 3 patients, ulcers did not show local features of infection. the initial antibiotic therapy was satisfactory in 13 cases. mortality rate directly associated with bacteremia was 18%, but the overall mortality rate was 62%. we did not identify data permitting a reliable prediction of the findings of blood culture; therefore, the initial empirical therapy should be active against staphylococcus  aureus, pseudomonas, enteric gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes including bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == the role of proteae in diarrhea.
AB  == a survey was undertaken on the occurrence of protease in the human fecal flora and its coincidence with other well-documented enteropathogens such as campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia, protozoa and rotavirus. a total of 2000 fecal specimens was investigated, 1000 from patients suffering from diarrhea and 1000 from healthy persons which served as controls. proteus mirabilis was isolated more frequently from diarrhea cases than from healthy people. the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). there was no correlation between its occurrence and isolation of campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus, and protozoa. however, a questionable coincidence was found with rotavirus (p less than 0.2) and a more certain correlation with yersinia enterocolitica (p less than 0.025).  proteus mirabilis in patients suffering from infection by other known enteropathogens was largely absent, suggesting that the organisms were independent causative agents of intestinal disorders. notwithstanding this, they  may additionally play a role as opportunists in enteric diseases due to some other pathogens.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of piperacillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitors tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr-830h), a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with clavulanic acid and sulbactam for enhancement of the activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant clinical isolates. piperacillin mics were determined in media containing a fixed concentration of 2  or 4 micrograms of the inhibitors per ml. the higher concentration was generally  more effective. tazobactam was superior to sulbactam in enhancing the spectrum and potency of piperacillin. although the calvulanic acid combination was more potent, tazobactam was effective for a similar spectrum of resistant gram-negative clinical isolates containing beta-lactamase. mics were reduced to the susceptible range for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp.,  salmonella spp., and shigella spp. combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam, but not clavulanic acid, were effective against morganella spp. some antagonism of the activity of piperacillin was observed with clavulanic acid but not with tazobactam or sulbactam. the inhibitors were similarly effective with piperacillin against beta-lactamase-positive staphylococcus spp. and the bacteroides fragilis group. piperacillin-tazobactam was more effective against a  broader spectrum of gram-negative enteric bacteria than ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was. combinations with tazobactam or clavulanic acid had a broader spectrum of activity than combinations with sulbactam against bacteria that produce characterized plasmid-mediated enzymes of clinical significance. in  particular, piperacillin with tazobactam or clavulanic acid, but not with sulbactam, inhibited tem-1, tem-2, and shv-1 enzymes. in vitro activity was reflected in vivo. tazobactam and clavulanic acid were superior to sulbactam in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of piperacillin in mice infected with beta-lactamase-positive e. coli, k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus. only combinations with tazobactam and sulbactam were effective against the morganella infection. tazobactam has a good potential for enhancing the clinical efficacy of piperacillin.

TI  == outpatient antimicrobial susceptibility: comparison with inpatient susceptibility patterns.
AB  == because specific outpatient epidemiologic data on the susceptibility of organisms are not readily available to guide empiric antibiotic therapy in the ambulatory setting, we reviewed all positive culture reports of clinical specimens (n = 935) isolated exclusively from outpatients of the eastern carolina family practice center over a 1-year period. eighty percent were from urine cultures, 12 percent  from wound cultures, and 5 percent from sputum cultures. an antibiogram was developed that showed a pattern of bacterial resistance similar to that reported  elsewhere. more than 80 percent of urinary tract infections were caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. more than 50 percent of skin and soft tissue infections were caused by staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus species. susceptibilities of these organisms were compared with those reported by the local hospital, and antimicrobial resistance  patterns were similar, which suggests that the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can follow susceptibility patterns derived from either inpatient or outpatient laboratories in areas with similar resistance patterns. further research into the epidemiology and susceptibility of organisms isolated from outpatients is needed. whether the susceptibility of inpatient and outpatient antimicrobial resistance found in this investigation can be extrapolated to other geographic areas remains to be determined.

(xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. lung infections caused by ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. these results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  == we have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. in most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. the isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: e.  coli (9), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), proteus mirabilis (5), serratia marcescens  (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). there were only two gram positive isolates: staphylococcus aureus (1) and staphylococcus epidermidis (1). the overall clinical response rate was 91%. gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. colonization by candida or enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. ciprofloxacin appears as  an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including  severe enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas infections.

AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in japan and u.s.a., respectively. after an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of cpz and sbt in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. in urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. antimicrobial interaction  studies using various combinations of cpz and sbt were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of sbt on the antimicrobial activity of cpz in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. sbt increased the activity of cpz against various clinical isolates tested except enterococcus faecalis. cpz-sbt at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of cpz, resulting in decreases in mic values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. these drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. based on pharmacokinetic data for cpz and sbt, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of cpz-sbt at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in japan and u.s.a., respectively, are appropriate. the effect of sbt on the activity of cpz was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. sbt/cpz, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. the mic80 of sbt/cpz (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) cfu/ml inoculum size were as follows: s. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and e. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. those of gram-negative bacilli were: escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.

TI  == review of the in-vitro spectrum and characteristics of cefmetazole (cs-1170).
AB  == the in-vitro antimicrobial qualities of cefmetazole are summarized from a review  of over 30 publications. cefmetazole, a 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, is shown to have an antimicrobial spectrum closely resembling cefoxitin's. however, cefmetazole is approximately two- to eight-fold more active than cefoxitin against commonly isolated species such as escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, pyogenic streptococci, pneumococci, and haemophilus influenzae. cefmetazole is also active against anaerobic pathogens, neisseria spp., citrobacter diversus, indole-positive proteus spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. cefmetazole is bactericidal against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. its mics and mbcs are minimally influenced by high inoculum  concentrations. beta-lactamases failed to hydrolyze cefmetazole significantly and cefmetazole is considered the most stable of the cephamycin drugs. some bacteroides strains produce beta-lactamases that are uniquely inhibited by cefmetazole. in-vitro tests with cefmetazole have been evaluated and interpretive criteria established for nccls methods: susceptible greater than or equal to 18 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/l) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). the consistent cross-resistance and -susceptibility observed between cefmetazole and cefoxitin requires the testing of only one of these agents routinely. quality control guidelines for cefmetazole disc diffusion (30 micrograms disc) and dilution tests are summarized in this review.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination.
AB  == in vitro testing of bacterial susceptibility to a combination of ticarcillin and  clavulanic acid was done, using 406 aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative isolates (considered to be pathogens) cultured from equine and small animal specimens. a microdilution broth technique of susceptibility testing was performed, using trays with wells containing a range of doubling concentrations of dehydrated ticarcillin (range, 0.50 to 128 micrograms/ml) with fixed concentration of clavulanic acid (4 micrograms/ml). the following isolates of equine origin were (90%) susceptible to concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid combinations of less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively: staphylococcus aureus, s intermedius, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent agglomerans, ent cloacae, escherichia coli, actinobacillus sp, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, rhodococcus equi, proteus  vulgaris, and bordetella bronchiseptica. isolates of small animal origin (90%) susceptible to less than or equal to 16 and 4 micrograms of ticarcillinclavulanic/ml included s aureus, s intermedius, ent aerogenes, ent agglomerans, pasteurella multocida, b bronchiseptica, pr mirabilis, and serratia  sp.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  == sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) is a preparation containing cpz and sbt, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. the antimicrobial activity of sbt/cpz was stronger than that of cpz alone. this increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of sbt was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and mic values. the mic80 of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of cpz alone was 50 micrograms/ml. mic80s of sbt/cpz against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of cpz, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. however, mic80s of sbt/cpz against staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and  proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of cpz alone, and mic80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the sbt/cpz disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which  contained 30 micrograms of cpz and 30 micrograms of sbt. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the sbt/cpz disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate mic values. to interpret results of the showa sbt/cpz disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than mic  less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml  less than mic less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points  of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of s. aureus, e. faecalis, and p. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to mics. however, if different break points against p. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of  mics. antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in-vitro activity of a new oral carbacephem, ly163892, was compared with cefaclor, cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and selected penicillins against 529 bacterial isolates. ly163892 exhibited greater activity in vitro than all four cephalosporins against haemophilus influenzae, beta-lactamase producing branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus mirabilis. ly163892 had equivalent potency to cefaclor against non-beta-lactamase producing  b. catarrhalis, streptococci and staphylococcus aureus. group d beta-haemolytic streptococci, proteus vulgaris, and methicillin-resistant staphylococci were universally resistant to ly163892 and the four cephalosporins. broth dilution experiments indicated that ly163892 was bactericidal against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and suggested that the antibiotic had a similar degree of stability to the beta-lactamases of h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis and staph. aureus as did cefaclor. the susceptibility of 16 strains of h. influenzae to ly163892 and cefaclor were equivalent when estimated using three different commercially available agar media. addition of carbon dioxide to  the incubation atmosphere significantly reduced the potency of both drugs.

AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  == ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  == renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (pkd) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. to study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. the ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. the mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis.

AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == comparative antibacterial activities of temafloxacin hydrochloride (a-62254) and  two reference fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo properties of a new 1-difluorophenyl-6-fluoroquinolone,  temafloxacin hydrochloride (a-62254), were compared with those of difloxacin and  ciprofloxacin. temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as ciprofloxacin and difloxacin against staphylococci and as active as ciprofloxacin and 2 twofold dilutions more active than difloxacin against streptococci. against gram-negative enteric bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa, temafloxacin hydrochloride was 2 twofold dilutions more active than difloxacin but 2 to 4 twofold dilutions less active than ciprofloxacin. the mics of temafloxacin hydrochloride and difloxacin  were increased by 2 to 5 twofold dilutions in urine at ph 6.5 compared with 4 to  5 twofold-dilution increases in the mics of ciprofloxacin. the mics of temafloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were increased by 1 to  3 twofold dilutions in serum. the mics of temafloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were the same or within 1 to 2 twofold dilutions at phs 6.5, 7.2, and 8.0. when administered orally in mouse protection tests, temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as difloxacin and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against infections with staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. against infections with gram-negative enteric bacteria and p. aeruginosa, temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as difloxacin and ciprofloxacin. temafloxacin hydrochloride was three times less active than difloxacin but was five times more active than ciprofloxacin against infections with salmonella typhimurium. temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as difloxacin and ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis pyelonephritis in mice. the peak serum concentration and serum half-life of temafloxacin hydrochloride in mice were approximately one-half and one-sixth, respectively, that of difloxacin  after oral administration. the peak serum concentration of temafloxacin hydrochloride in mice after oral administration was six times higher than that of ciprofloxacin, and the serum half-life was equal to that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [the antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sisomicin (siso) against clinical isolates obtained in the second half of 1986 were investigated together with other 4 aminoglycosides (ags) (gentamicin (gm), tobramycin (tob), dibekacin (dkb), amikacin (amk] and 2 cephems (cefotiam, cefotaxime), and were compared to the results reported in the period of late 1970's through early 1980's in japan. 1. the incidence of siso-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the present study was 18% and is comparable to that of the other studies suggesting that the incidence  of siso resistant strains remains on the stable level. the incidence of siso-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the tendency of slight increase. 2.  siso-resistant strains of enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and citrobacter  freundii did not show increase from the 1970/1980 levels. 3. isolation rates of siso-resistant indole(+) proteus varied depending on strains. isolation rates of  siso-resistant p. vulgaris and morganella morganii were both as low as 4%, but that of providencia rettgeri was as high as 60%. refering to an american study reporting that the genus providencia including p. rettgeri showed high incidence  of resistance to siso as well as to gm or tob, we pointed out that the antimicrobial activity of ags against genus providencia should be evaluated separately from those of other indole(+) proteus strains. 4. no siso-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae or p. mirabilis were found. 5. siso had good antimicrobial activity against most of the investigated species and siso may still be regarded as one of the clinically useful ags.

TI  == erythromycin-induced suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses. a potential mechanism of superinfection in the lung.
AB  == erythromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic commonly used in patients with respiratory infections. certain of these patients become colonized with new microorganisms and develop superinfections. antibiotics have a number of effects  other than simply killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria and may have direct effects upon host cells, including phagocytes. in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that erythromycin decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) directed migration. to test the hypothesis that erythromycin inhibits normal pmn migration into the alveoli in response to a bacterial challenge, mice  were challenged by aerosol inhalation with proteus mirabilis or staphylococcus aureus and injected intravenously with erythromycin (50 or 100 mg/kg). pulmonary  bactericidal activity and total lavaged lung cell and differential counts were determined 4 h after bacterial challenge. in control mice, only 24 +/- 2% of the  initial inoculum of p. mirabilis was viable at 4 h. at a dose of 100 mg/kg, lung  defenses after erythromycin were ablated, allowing the proliferation of p. mirabilis to 113 +/- 5% of the initial inoculum. the number of pmn obtained by lavage after p. mirabilis challenge was also inhibited by erythromycin in a dose-dependent manner. in untreated animals, 5.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) pmn were recovered as compared with 3.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(6) and 1.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) with increasing doses of erythromycin. intrapulmonary bactericidal activity against s. aureus was not impaired by erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. comparison with other new cephems].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of  cpz, cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx) and latamoxef (lmox). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of sbt and cpz mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by  the dilution method using mueller-hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of cpz. antimicrobial activities of sbt/cpz against principally penicillinase (pcase) producing bacteria, i.e., s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, were superior to those of cpz alone. the presence of sbt in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced cpz's antimicrobial activities against these pcase producing strains. the synergistic antimicrobial effects of sbt in combination with cpz were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (cepase) producing bacteria, i.e., c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris, and p. aeruginosa, and exerted with sbt at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by mic80's of tested agents showed that sbt/cpz had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria than ctm, ctx and lmox. mic's of sbt/cpz were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of s. aureus, 18% of c. freundii, 10% of enterobacter spp., 26% of s. marcescens, 2% of p. vulgaris, and 18% of p. aeruginosa. these resistant strains against which the addition of sbt showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. it is concluded that the presence of cpz resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from cpz is increasing. when these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of sbt/cpz in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.

AB  == a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, bmy-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. bmy-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. bmy-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more  active than cephalexin against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae.  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to bmy-28100 and cefaclor. the bactericidal activity of bmy-28100 against s. aureus, e. coli and p. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as mic  value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. the stability of bmy-28100 against  penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. bmy-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three gram-positive bacterial infections. bmy-28100 was also more potent against infections of h. influenzae and p. mirabilis, but slightly less active against e. coli juhl than cefaclor. blood level parameters of bmy-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. the urinary recovery of bmy-28100 was somewhat  higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. bmy-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees c.

AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefadroxil were determined for 749 defined clinically-significant bacteria isolated in a london teaching hospital and for 63 strains from an international collection of gram-negative bacilli. assuming a breakpoint of 16 mg/l, for the hospital isolates 81.8% of gram-negative bacilli and 83.4% of gram-positive cocci were sensitive. no significant difference between in-patient, out-patient or community-acquired isolates was found. ninety-five and a half per cent of escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes (including gentamicin-resistant strains), proteus mirabilis, and (with the exception of streptococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) all gram-positive cocci were sensitive. of 41 strains of enterobacter spp., were resistant. most indole-positive proteus, and all serratia and acinetobacter spp. were resistant, including 36 additional strains taken from an international collection. of 30 strains of haemophilus influenzae, only six had mics of 16 mg/l or less. for disc susceptibility testing, the standard disc containing 30 micrograms of cefadroxil reliably gave zones of greater than 17 mm  for organisms with mics of less than 16 mg/l. a zone of less than 14 mm corresponded to mics of greater than 64 mg/l. despite a lack of controlled clinical trials, the results of this study (taken with favourable pharmacokinetics) suggest that cefadroxil has potential as an oral cephalosporin  in hospital practice in the u.k.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. the in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (ddtc) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmtc) were investigated. both  ddtc and dmtc were effective against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). by agar diffusion, ddtc at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to  34 mm against mrsa. the dmtc produced slightly greater zone sizes against mrsa of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for dmtc against mrsa was 6 micrograms per ml. both ddtc and dmtc were also effective against enterococci, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, salmonella species, serratia marcescens and citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. the mics of dmtc for klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, salmonella and citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the mics for proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. in addition, dmtc was synergistic with gentamicin against mrsa and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. additive and synergistic effects of dmtc were displayed with gentamicin against s. aureus including methicillin-resistant  s. aureus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the post-antibiotic suppressive effect (pae) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a pae against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, the paes of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus faecalis were determined. the differences in pae determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for s. aureus and e. coli. ciprofloxacin had a pae by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. a ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in mueller-hinton broth, ph 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a pae of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for s. aureus, but had no effect on s. faecalis. exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour pae for e. coli, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae. use of mueller-hinton broth with a  magnesium concentration of 8 mm, ph 5.5, yielded similar results. using human serum, a four-hour pae was found for p. aeruginosa. there was a progressive increase in the pae as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from  0.9 hours to three hours. increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to  eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for p. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the mbc for e. coli did not cause a significant difference  in the pae using a two-hour exposure. overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent pae for most gram-negative bacteria and for s. aureus, but not for s. faecalis. a pae caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the ph adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. these results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment  of tissue and urinary infections.

AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [etiology of corneal ulcers with special reference to bacterial genesis].
AB  == the authors report on 134 patients (141 eyes) seen between may 1982 and december  1985 with corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. eight patients (11 eyes) had a facial palsy, 7 (7 eyes) a varicella zoster infection, 1 (2 eyes) a marginal ulcer ("furrow keratitis") associated with collagenosis, 29 (29 eyes) an ulcerative keratitis with endophthalmitis, 1 (2 eyes) a pemphigoid-associated ulcer and 90 (92 eyes) a herpetic infection. pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated from 20 patients: 10 coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus (4 coinfections), 3 pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 coinfection), 2 proteus mirabilis (1 coinfection), 2 escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and beta-hemolyzing streptococci as well as enterococci in one case each, and non-hemolyzing streptococci and alpha-hemolyzing streptococci in two cases each as coinfections. a comparison of the range of bacterial strains of postoperative  endophthalmitis and kerato-/conjunctivitis with bacterial corneal ulcers revealed a high percentage of gram-negative organisms in the latter. laboratory work-up should include microscopy, agar plating and differentiation as well as antibiotic sensitivity testing and modern immunofluorescent direct techniques. management includes bactericidal topical and systemic antibiotic regimens as well as surgical procedures if necessary, e.g., perforating tectonic and mini-keratoplasty, and conjunctival flapping followed by lamellar keratoplasty.

TI  == in-vitro bacterial killing kinetics of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  == an in-vitro model was developed to study the rates of killing by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combinations of various beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin resistant, logarithmic phase clinical isolates. killing, defined as a 3 log reduction, was dependent on the organism, the concentration of clavulanic acid and the duration of exposure. for most isolates studied an optimum period of exposure to and concentration of clavulanic acid could be defined. certain test strains showed optimum response to readily attainable in-vivo concentrations of clavulanic acid while other strains, although sensitive by mic data showed a poor response. the clinical implications of this are discussed.

TI  == in-vitro anti-microbial susceptibility of clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria to ten antibiotics including phosphomycin.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ten antibiotics was determined for  various bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens in a lagos hospital. the in-vitro activity of penicillin and tetracycline was not very impressive and  a similarity was noticed in the resistance patterns of these two antibiotics, while the activity in vitro of the relatively more toxic aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol was high for gram-negative rods. ceftazidime demonstrated the highest activity in vitro against all pathogens studied. cefoxitin, cefuroxime and phosphomycin demonstrated an impressive activity in vitro. clindamycin was very active against strains of staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactamase production amongst these strains was studied and the clinical significance of this and their mic results are discussed.

TI  == modulation of pulmonary defense mechanisms by acute exposures to nitrogen dioxide.
AB  == the effect of acute exposures to no2 on the antibacterial defenses of the murine  lung was assessed following inhalation challenges with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and pasteurella pneumotropica. animals were challenged with the bacteria and exposed for 4 hr to increasing concentrations of no2 after which pulmonary bactericidal activity was quantitated. with s. aureus pulmonary antibacterial defenses were suppressed at no2 levels of 4.0 ppm and greater. exposure to 10.0 ppm enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of p. mirabilis which correlated with an increase in the phagocytic cell populations lavaged from the lungs; at 20.0 ppm bactericidal activity against p. mirabilis was impaired. pulmonary antibacterial defenses against p. pneumotropica were impaired at 10.0 ppm which correlated with a decrease in the retrieved phagocytic lung cell population. reversing the order of treatment (ie., no2 exposure prior to bacterial challenge) raised the threshold concentration for no2-induced impairment of intrapulmonary bacterial killing. with s. aureus the effect was not observed at 5.0 ppm but at 10.0 ppm and with p. mirabilis not at 20.0 ppm but at  30.0 ppm intrapulmonary killing was enhanced. exposures up to 20.0 ppm of no2 did not effect the physical translocation mechanisms of the lung as quantitated by declines in pulmonary radiotracer activity following aerogenic challenge with 32p-labeled staphylococci. these studies demonstrate that no2 modulates pulmonary antibacterial defenses and points to the importance of the challenge organism and the exposure protocol in establishing a threshold dose for the adverse effect.

TI  == worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in japan, the united states, canada, france, austria, and hungary. standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. the susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for proteus mirabilis. susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.

TI  == role of internal fixation in infection of open fractures: studies with staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis.
AB  == studies of infections in open fractures are described. the hamster was chosen as  the experimental model. osteotomies of the femur were created with an osteotomy saw. some osteotomies were left to heal and others were fixed with an 0.9 mm k-wire. the infection rates in fixed and unfixed fractures were compared. the first group of hamsters with fixed and unfixed osteotomies was returned to cages  with open wounds. there was no difference in the infection rate at 2 weeks. the second group was deliberately contaminated with staphylococcus aureus and then returned to cages with open wounds. in this group, the infection rate at 2 weeks  was lower in the internally-fixed fractures than in the unfixed fractures. the third group was deliberately contaminated with the gram negative organism proteus mirabilis. in these animals, the infection rate was increased in the presence of  the internal fixation device. the fourth group was deliberately contaminated with both staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. the infection rate in these animals was very high; proteus was recovered from those animals with internal fixation and staphylococcus was recovered from those animals without internal fixation. these studies in the hamster document the usefulness of this animal as  an inexpensive and reproducible model for studying infection of open fractures. the hamsters tolerated the procedure well, and wound and fracture healing progressed satisfactorily.

TI  == comparison of cefixime and co-trimoxazole in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection. a double-blind general practice study.
AB  == five hundred and twenty-eight patients with presumptive acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uti) were randomly assigned to receive cefixime 400 mg once daily, cefixime 200 mg twice daily or co-trimoxazole 2 tablets twice a day for 10 days; 477 completed at least 5 days of therapy. of the patients 342 (65%)  had positive baseline urine cultures, yielding 353 pathogens. a microbiological response was determined for 280 pathogens (79%), eradication being observed in over 94% of isolates; 153 pathogens (43%) were sensitive to both cefixime and co-trimoxazole and eradication was observed in over 96% of cases. clinical response correlated well with microbiological response. the incidence of diarrhoea and stool changes was higher (p less than 0.005) in the patients who received cefixime once daily than in the other groups. there was a significantly  higher incidence of stool changes with cefixime twice daily than with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.05), but these did not necessitate discontinuation  of therapy. nausea was commoner with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.05). the majority of pathogens isolated were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and staphylococci. approximately 24% of e. coli were resistant in vitro to co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.005). cefixime 200 mg twice daily is an effective and safe alternative to co-trimoxazole in the management of acute uncomplicated uti.

TI  == response of bacterial antigen in palmoplantar pustulosis.
AB  == motilities of leukocytes in response to bacterial antigens or sera were examined  in tissues from patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (ppp). accelerated migration towards bacterial antigens was detected in the case of staphylococcus epidermidis in 9 of 19 patients, to propionibacterium acnes in 5 of 19, to proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus aureus in 3 of 19, while no acceleration was found in neutrophils from the controls. a significantly accelerated migration of  normal lymphocytes in response to both patients' and control sera was nil. inhibition of migration of guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells mixed with lymphocytes from ppp patients was detected in 12 out of 14 patients with the addition of s. epidermidis antigen and 8 of 14 with the addition of p. acnes antigen, while no such inhibition was detected in all 7 controls. the accelerated migration of neutrophils and inhibition of macrophages may participate in the development of ppp.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the yokohama city university hospital].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the  standard method of the japanese congress of chemotherapy. the results obtained are summarized below. cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against enterococcus sp., b. fragilis and s. marcescens. s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against citrobacter sp. and e. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against h. influenzae and indole positive proteus group. cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa. resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among staphylococcus sp., while the mics of other antibiotics against staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing  because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.

AB  == purification of a bactericidal protein (bp) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. the first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with matrex-gel orange a, was  followed by cation-exchange chromatography with bio-rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. only one peak of bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa type i was found after each chromatographic step.  characterization of bp showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of  55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified bp  was most active against the six strains of p. aeruginosa tested and against escherichia coli b (a deep rough mutant). purified bp killed 5 x 10(6) cfu of p.  aeruginosa type i per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. proteus mirabilis  and staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of bp. bp was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. the amino acid composition of bp is presented.

TI  == effect of radiation dose on the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from mice.
AB  == the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the blood, spleen, and liver was investigated in mice that were exposed to 7, 8, 9, or 10 gy 60co radiation. microorganisms were detected more often in animals exposed to higher doses of radiation. the number of mice that were culture positive and the number of isolates in one site increased with increasing dose. bacteria were recovered in mice killed at various times after radiation, in 3 of 100 mice exposed to 7 gy, in 13 of 100 irradiated with 8 gy, in 23 of 90 exposed to 9 gy, and in 34 of 87 irradiated with 10 gy. the predominant organisms recovered were escherichia coli, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides spp. escherichia coli and anaerobes were more often isolated in animals exposed to 10 gy, while s. aureus was more often recovered in those irradiated with 9 gy. these data demonstrate a relationship between the dose of radiation and the rate of infection due to enteric aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == synergy of amoxycillin combined with clavulanate and ytr 830 in experimental infections in mice.
AB  == ytr 830, a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, is synergistic with amoxycillin in vitro against a number of beta-lactamase-producing organisms. the combination of amoxycillin-ytr 830 was compared to amoxycillin-clavulanate in the treatment of experimental staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii and proteus mirabilis infections in mice. both combinations were synergistic with amoxycillin against all three test organisms. the amoxycillin-clavulanate combination was superior against s. aureus and c. freundii while amoxycillin-ytr 830 was more effective against p. mirabilis. the difference in efficacy between the two drug combinations appears to relate to the degree of protection afforded the animals by the beta-lactamase inhibitor alone. ytr 830 is a promising new agent and should undergo further investigation.

TI  == acute mastoiditis. influence of antibiotic treatment on the bacterial spectrum.
AB  == the work was undertaken to investigate the spectrum of bacteria responsible for acute mastoiditis and to find out whether it is affected by intake of antibiotics prior to surgical treatment. the records were reviewed of 22 children with acute  mastoiditis in whom mastoidectomy had been performed and bacterial cultures obtained. eleven of the patients had had antibiotic treatment prior to admission  (9 penicillin v and 2 erythromycin). streptococcus pneumoniae was found in 8 of the purulent discharges: haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus beta-hemolyticus and staphylococcus aureus in 2 each; proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas pyocyaneus and a bacteroides strain in 1 each, while five discharges-all from patients pretreated with antibiotics-yielded no growth. none of the 9 patients pretreated  with penicillin v provided pure cultures of pneumococci or beta-hemolytic streptococci, while one or the other of these species was found in 8 of the 11 untreated patients. gram-negative bacteria were found both among those with and those without antibiotic pretreatment. the data indicate that pneumococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci are more likely to cause mastoiditis than are the other pathogens found in acute otitis media, and that, when drained at operation, purulent discharges are often found to have been sterilized by the pre-operative  antibiotic treatment.

TI  == characterization of pathogenic bacteria by automated headspace concentration-gas  chromatography.
AB  == automated headspace concentration-gas chromatography (ahc-gc) was used to profile the volatile metabolites produced by proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. bacterial cultures were incubated in trypticase soy broth and examined at 24 h. the profiles were consistent for each genus examined and variation observed among the different strains of each species was chiefly quantitative. the volatiles were identified by concurrent headspace concentration-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and consisted mainly of isobutanol, isopentanol, isopentyl acetate, 1-undecene and methyl ketones. there were sufficient differences in the profiles in the 4-6 min  elution period to distinguish p. aeruginosa and s. aureus from each other and from the other two bacteria. p. mirabilis and k. pneumoniae typically showed three intense peaks which corresponded to isobutanol, isopentyl acetate and isopentanol. the determination of volatiles by ahc-gc is sensitive, rapid and offers a possible alternative for automatic detection and characterization of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == role of cell surface receptors in the regulation of intracellular killing of bacteria by murine peritoneal exudate neutrophils.
AB  == the role of the fc and third component of complement (c3) receptors on mouse neutrophils in the control of killing of proteus mirabilis, opsonized in normal mouse serum (nms) or heated immune mouse serum (hims), was studied. the events following incubation of neutrophils with p. mirabilis and the events associated with bacterial killing were assayed. the respiratory burst was quantified by chemiluminescence (cl). levels of leukocyte-associated bacteria were determined after a 20-min ingestion period as a measure of phagocytosis. bacterial killing was measured while ingestion was allowed to continue or as a discrete process when extracellular, noningested bacteria had been removed and neutrophils with intracellular bacteria were incubated in the presence of serum. modification of these responses in the presence of three monoclonal antibodies (mab), nimp-r10 and m1/70, which bind to different epitopes of the mouse c3 receptor, and 2.4g2,  which binds to the mouse fc receptor, was investigated. mab to the c3, but not to the fc, receptors reduced cl, ingestion, and intracellular killing of nms-opsonized p. mirabilis. mab to the fc receptor diminished cl to and reduced the rate of ingestion of hims-opsonized bacteria. the two mab to the c3 receptor  each produced a similar inhibition of ingestion and intracellular killing of hims-opsonized bacteria, but they only partially blocked cl. a range of mab preparations reactive with other murine antigens did not inhibit these events, either with nms- or hims-opsonized p. mirabilis. the results suggest that c3 receptors on mouse neutrophils played a predominant role in regulation of the killing of p. mirabilis. similar results were found for staphylococcus aureus. c3 receptors were necessary for maximal expression of all functions culminating in bacterial kill. that mab to the c3 receptor inhibited phagocytosis of hims-opsonized bacteria in similar fashion to the effect of mab to the fc receptor and in contrast to the lack of effect of control mab may reflect steric  hindrance of the fc receptor by mab binding to the c3 receptor, or it may reflect that the receptors are linked in murine neutrophils as they are in human neutrophils.

AB  == intraabdominal abscesses were induced in mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of bacteroides fragilis and escherichia coli plus bran as the abscess-potentiating agent. six- or seven-day-old abscesses were mechanically disaggregated in buffer, and the cells obtained were fractionated on discontinuous percoll density gradients. neutrophil populations of different density, each approximately 90% pure, were isolated. when the abscess-derived neutrophils were subsequently incubated with normal serum in vitro under aerobic conditions, the viability of the gram-negative bacteria that had been phagocytosed within the abscess did not  change significantly. this anergy to intracellular bacteria (on subsequent incubation in vitro under optimal conditions for phagocytic killing) was also found for neutrophils that had been obtained from abscesses induced by a mixture  that included proteus mirabilis plus b. fragilis and from those induced by e. coli plus p. mirabilis. while unable to significantly kill intracellular organisms that had been phagocytosed in vivo, the abscess-derived neutrophils could engulf and kill organisms to which they were exposed in vitro. neutrophils  from abscesses induced by p. mirabilis only plus bran killed that organism introduced in vitro significantly more effectively than the organisms that had been engulfed in vivo. in contrast, neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus plus bran were able to kill their intracellular organisms on subsequent incubation in vitro as effectively as they  could kill added s. aureus. neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood and from induced peritoneal exudates of abscess-bearing mice were able to phagocytose and kill organisms in vitro with greater efficiency than abscess-derived neutrophils. the mechanism whereby neutrophils from abscesses induced by the gram-positive organism s. aureus can kill the organisms phagocytosed in vivo on subsequent in vitro incubation, in contrast to the relative anergy to their intracellular organisms displayed by neutrophils derived from abscesses induced by combinations of gram-negative bacteria, is not known.

AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

TI  == ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  == the efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n  = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). causative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n  = 1), haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group a streptococcus (n = 10), staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 2), proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and proteus vulgaris (n = 1). sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. the ceftriaxone regimen was well  tolerated.

TI  == endophthalmitis following intraocular lens implantation: report of 30 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == bacterial endophthalmitis is a postoperative complication of intraocular lens implantation. a review of 30 cases showed that 77% occurred within seven days of  initial cataract surgery and that all cases occurred within 32 days. common presenting symptoms and signs included pain localized to the involved eye, decreased visual acuity, conjunctival injection, anterior chamber inflammation, hypopyon, and absent or poor red reflex. diagnosis of an infectious etiology was  made by aqueous and vitreous sampling for gram stain and culture. the commonest bacterial agents were coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus, but a wide variety of gram-negative and -positive organisms were also isolated. on the basis of this series and review of the literature, optimal treatment includes prompt diagnosis by culture and gram stain of vitreous fluid, frequent application of topical antibiotics, and administration of intraocular antibiotics. intravenous antibiotics and vitrectomy may improve the visual outcome. removal of the intraocular lens is unnecessary for bacteriologic cure and is not associated with improved visual outcome.

TI  == comparative activity of ofloxacin and seven other antimicrobials against urea-splitting microorganisms.
AB  == urinary tract infections caused by urea-splitting bacteria are severe clinical conditions and very difficult to treat due to their association with calculi, and because such bacteria form ammonium hydroxide raising the urinary ph and thereby  creating an unfavourable condition for the action of most antimicrobials. we tested ofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin against 143 gram-negative and 99 gram-positive bacteria, all urea-splitting, isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. all drugs were tested using media at two different phs (ph 7.4 and ph 8.5) and two inoculum sizes (10(4) and  10(6) cfu). although ofloxacin and norfloxacin had a similar spectrum of activity, ofloxacin had somewhat greater intrinsic activity against gram-positive organisms. mics of ofloxacin for 90% of proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and the corynebacterium group d2 were greater than or equal to 4 mg/l. the activity of the other drugs varied, but there were many strains resistant to these antimicrobials. the ph and inoculum size did not significantly affect the activity of ofloxacin so that this drug should be useful for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the commonest urea-splitting bacteria involved in such infections.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

AB  == in a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis  (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). all the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone  or in combination with surgical intervention. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. the 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had mics between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. the mics for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the mics for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. one s. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (mic 16 mg/l). the tolerability was good. phlebitis was observed in one case only. based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.

TI  == bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  == the pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected.  quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. the results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.

TI  == microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  == the potential of octenidine hydrochloride (win 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. semilogarithmic survival curves were  plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against staphylococcus aureus. the microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, and candida albicans. death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microm (0.94 microgram/ml)  caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and e. coli and c. albicans were the least susceptible. octenidine was more active than  chlorhexidine against each test strain. skin-degerming activities of aqueous and  formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. aqueous  octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.

TI  == lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == the most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major  problems. empyema can present an important problem in management. although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. screening of sputum gram stains under 100 x magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. the major causes of pneumonia are streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and legionella. however, many other organisms are  capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, s. aureus, hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae,  k. ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter cloacae, proteus  mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, neisseria meningitidis and branhamella catarrhalis. several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. only minor side-effects were encountered--coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin, mk0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. only rare strains of enterobacter species and proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. hemophilus and neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. only pseudomonas maltophilia  and pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (mic50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. all anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of clostridium difficile. staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (mic90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and s. faecium strains were frankly resistant. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates  had a mic90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and  some p. aeruginosa strains. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. the induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. the 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m2-a3). imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.

TI  == role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  == imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. cultures prior to therapy yielded staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group d and non-group d enterococci (49), group a streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), escherichia coli (32), proteus mirabilis (31), enterobacter (21), klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven p. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. imipenem/cilastatin appears to  be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both  polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these  bacteria is suspected or proved.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == aminophylline-induced suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses.
AB  == respiratory infections are frequently observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indicating that host defenses are compromised. antibacterial defenses of the lung against such infections include the alveolar macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) that migrate into the lung to provide auxiliary phagocytic defenses. to test the hypothesis that aminophylline  acutely impairs pulmonary antibacterial defenses, mice were challenged by aerosol inhalation with staphylococcus aureus or proteus mirabilis and injected intraperitoneally with aminophylline (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg). pulmonary bactericidal activity and total lavaged lung cell and differential counts were determined 4 h after bacterial challenge. the highest dose of aminophylline suppressed the killing of s. aureus so that 55 +/- 5% of the initial viable bacteria remained as compared with 22 +/- 4% in the control animals. in contrast, there was a dose-related suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses against  gram-negative bacteria. with doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg, lung defenses were ablated, allowing the proliferation of p. mirabilis to 115 +/- 9% and 253 +/- 9%, respectively, the control value being 26 +/- 3%. the number of pmn obtained by lavage after aerosol challenge with p. mirabilis was also inhibited by aminophylline in a dose-dependent manner. from the lungs of untreated animals 5.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) pmn were recovered as compared with 3.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(6), 2.5 +/-  0.2 x 10(6), and 1.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(6), respectively, with increasing doses of aminophylline. the bactericidal activity of lavaged pmn from the lungs of aminophylline-treated rats challenged with the gram-negative bacterium in vivo was significantly depressed when compared with that in control animals.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)

AB  == all strains of staphylococcus aureus and gram negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). augmentin is active  against penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. according to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "rsr" and "rrr" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are  chiefly found among enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter and indole + proteus; in  these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of proteus vulgaris strains. "rrs" and "rri" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among e. coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae and oxytoca, and proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.

TI  == an evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980rp).
AB  == ceftiolene (42980rp) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. the affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight pbps of e. coli. enterobacter cloacae. proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the affinity of ceftiolene for pbp1 of staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for pbp3. the bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against gram-negative organisms  was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into e. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene-  or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. growth of staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. these observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine mic determinations to distinguish  between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.

AB  == chemiluminescence (cl) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal cl response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. we investigated the luminol-enhanced cl response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. we analyzed  the cl response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees c.  the cl response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees c. variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced cl. each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. in the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in cl: enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and zymosan. in the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pyogenes. the cl response also reflected serum opsonic activity. the effect of inactivated complement, factor b, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak cl; however, a strain of e. coli caused a variation in  peak time rather than peak height. different cl kinetics were shown for three strains of k. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or  cell wall characteristics. this study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal cl response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. mics of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as mics of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. against staphylococcus aureus. haemophilus influenzae and the bacteroides fragilis group  the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. piperacillin was  more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against pseudomonas  aeruginosa.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial properties of fk 027, a new orally active cephem antibiotic.
AB  == fk 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as citrobacter and enterobacter species and serratia marcescens. fk 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative proteus species, providencia species, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. with few exceptions, fk 027 was active against strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. the bactericidal activity of fk 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including proteus species, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, and s. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. the therapeutic activities of fk 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  == in a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics90) against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter aerogenes. subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized,  crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. the 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. the area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at  least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the mic90 for all seven groups of pathogens;  at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the mic90 against the majority of bacterial groups. in contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the mic90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin  were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. these data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the mics90  longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.

TI  == determination of surface charge of some bacteria by colloid titration.
AB  == the surface charge of bacteria is always negative except below ph 2. the negative charge depends mainly upon phosphate and carboxyl groups. the charge of six kinds of bacteria was determined by colloid titration between ph 2 and 11. when there is amino group on the cell surface, it is positive as ammonium cation between ph  2 and 10, and it combines with the negative groups to neutralize the negative charge. in the presence of formalin, the colloid titration results show that the  free amine is blocked by formalin, and the amino group can be estimated by the difference between the two titration results. above ph 10, the titration results  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi in the presence of formalin implied the  existence of guanidyl group. the titration results of living bacterial suspensions were quite the same as those of heat-killed ones.

TI  == do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  == we examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (acb) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (ig). for this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with ig  preparations. these were obtained from infected urine either by removal of ig from acb (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 m glycine-hcl, or 3 m nascn) or by staphylococcal protein a affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. coincubation of either ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, several escherichia coli strains, enterococci, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with ig. coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation  with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. adsorption of ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. coating was observed both with intact igg and with f(ab)2 fragments. we further examined the proportion of  bacteria coated with iga, igg, and igm in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. the frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. it is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. a major problem of the acb test is definition of the normal range.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefoperazone (cpz) against clinical isolates including various beta-lactamase-producing strains were studied and compared with those of cefotiam (ctm). cpz had a broad spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. especially, cpz showed apparently more  potent antibacterial activities than ctm against enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, cpz was less active than ctm against staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. the stability and affinity of cpz for various types of beta-lactamase were also studied. cpz was more resistant to hydrolysis by typical cephalosporinase (csase) and cefuroximase (cxase) than ctm, but was less stable to penicillinase (pcase). cpz often showed  higher affinity to beta-lactamases than ctm. the study for the inducer-activity revealed that cpz hardly induced csase production in e. cloacae and proteus vulgaris while ctm highly induced in both strains. cpz was more active against csase-producers than ctm, especially against strains which inducibly produced the enzyme. it was speculated that this activity was responsible for the superior stability to csase and low inducer-activity for csase production.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial multiplication by the iron chelator deferoxamine: potentiating effect of ascorbic acid.
AB  == since iron is essential for the multiplication of microorganisms, the effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine, with or without ascorbic acid, on the growth of 43 strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, alcaligenes faecalis, neisseria meningitidis and species of salmonella, enterobacter, pseudomonas and providencia, was investigated with the use of an automated turbidimeter. addition of deferoxamine (25-400 micrograms/ml) to the incubation medium was inhibitory in a dose-dependent fashion. at concentrations between 200-400 micrograms/ml, growth was about 25% lower than control values. however, when ascorbic acid (100 micrograms/ml) was added to the culture medium, this antimicrobial activity of deferoxamine was significantly increased to on average 75% of the control value (p less than 0.05). ascorbic acid alone had no bacteriostatic properties. growth  in the presence of 200 micrograms/ml deferoxamine combined with 100 micrograms/ml ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that in control media without additions (p less than 0.001). addition of ferric citrate to the culture medium at a concentration sufficient to saturate all of the deferoxamine with iron, abolished the growth inhibiting effect of deferoxamine. the results provide evidence that deferoxamine is bacteriostatic due to its capacity to deplete iron  which would otherwise be used for bacterial multiplication, and that ascorbic acid enhances this antibacterial property of deferoxamine.

TI  == susceptibility of blood isolates to various antibiotics, in particular to cephalosporins.
AB  == of 760 bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of acutely ill patients in a general hospital in hong kong for 1 year, 69.9% of the isolates were gram-negative aerobes mainly escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.0% were gram-positive aerobes mainly staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and 8.1%  were anaerobes mainly bacteroides spp. the susceptibility of the aerobic isolates to various antibiotics was tested. ampicillin was found to be active mainly against the enterococci and some other gram-positive organisms while most isolates of staph. aureus and the gram-negative bacteria were resistant. in contrast, cephalothin was found only slightly less active than the second generation cephalosporins against gram-negative blood isolates but considerably more active against staph. aureus and other gram-positive isolates. the three aminoglycosides tested, i.e., gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, showed similar good activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, but amikacin  had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting most of the other gram-negative isolates as well as isolates of staph. aureus. the third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, all had a high activity against the gram-negative but a reduced activity against the gram-positive bacteria. ceftazidime had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting all the gram-negative isolates including pseudomonas aeruginosa, while cefotaxime showed the best overall activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative blood isolates.

TI  == biocidal braided sutures.
AB  == once sutures become contaminated it is difficult for local tissue defenses or antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria and prevent infection. impregnation of sutures with antibiotics before implantation is one way to prevent bacterial seeding of the suture surface. in this study, braided silk and dacron sutures were impregnated with the antibiotic complex, neomycin palmitate. using our standard wound model in the mouse, the efficacy of these biocidal sutures was determined in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. implantation of these biocidal sutures into tissue contaminated with 10(7) organisms resulted in substantially decreased numbers of bacteria as compared with that of tissue receiving control sutures. in most cases, the tissue bacterial counts in the presence of biocidal sutures were  also considerably lower than that for similarly contaminated tissue without a suture. consequently, the presence of the neomycin palmitate eliminated the infection-potentiating effect of the suture. the therapeutic benefit of the biocidal sutures was related to the dose of antibiotic complex and was not adversely affected by delaying suture implantation.

AB  == organic acids in the contents of the cholesteatoma sac from 28 cases were studied by gas chromatographic technique. five volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate and isovalerate) and lactate were detected in large amounts, which may lower the ph of the cholesteatoma content. these acids were considered to be derived from products of anaerobic microorganisms. therefore, the contents from 12 cases were cultured anaerobically in a glove box. obligate microorganisms were identified in 92% of the cases and peptococcus, bacteroides,  and clostridium species were frequently isolated. in vitro, such obligate anaerobes produced various organic acids from the cholesteatoma content. facultatives such as staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis produced acetate in the content under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas no organic acid was produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa. organic acids in the cholesteatoma content could be fermentative products made by the microorganisms, anaerobes and  facultatives, which use the content as a substrate for acid production.

AB  == the activity of three aminoglycosides and six beta-lactam antibiotics on strains  of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci was studied. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), and the minimal antibiotic concentrations (macs) were determined after 5 h of incubation in broth cultures by colony-forming-unit counts. the mics were also determined by agar dilution after 24 h of incubation. the mics on agar after 24 h of incubation were higher than those in broth after 5 h of incubation. the differences ranged from 1.1- to 14.2-fold, but in most cases were only three- to  fivefold (p less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). the mbcs at 5 and 24 h were comparable in 71% of tests. for current practice, the mbc of enterococci can be determined after 5 h of incubation with antibiotics. the aminoglycosides showed mbcs which were closer to the mics than were those of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which required a higher multiple of the mic to show a bactericidal effect. the mbcs of oxacillin and cefamandole for s. aureus after 5 h of incubation were greater than 128 times the respective mics. the macs ranged from  1/1.5 to 1/7 of the 5-h mics. the three endpoints, mic, mbc, and mac, indicate the antibacterial range of an antibiotic in terms of inhibition of growth and bacterial survival. the data suggest that the antibacterial range of an antibiotic is similar for most strains of a given species and is, to some extent, a characteristic of similar antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

AB  == after description of the most important properties of fosfomycin including pharmacokinetics, antibacterial activity and hitherto got clinical experiences the determinations of the resistance on frequent clinical pathogenic agents are reported. they were performed in the diffusion test in a platelet content of 20 micrograms with admixture of glucose-6-phosphate. high sensitivity rates showed e. coli, p. mirabilis, hemophiliacs and above all staph. aureus, but also a large part of the klebsiella and the pseudomonas strains could be classified as sensitive. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci mostly proved as resistant.  thus, in an oral therapy the spectre is smaller than in a highly dosed parenteral supply. nevertheless, fosfomycin in the two forms of application is to be regarded as an enrichment of the therapeutic possibilities and further should be  tested clinically.

TI  == analysis of the disagreement between automated bioluminescence-based and culture  methods for detecting significant bacteriuria, with proposals for standardizing evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.
AB  == a fully automated method for detecting significant bacteriuria is described which uses firefly luciferin and luciferase to detect bacterial atp in urine. the automated method was calibrated and evaluated, using 308 urine specimens, against two reference culture methods. we obtained a specificity of 0.79 and sensitivity  of 0.75 using a quantitative pour plate reference test and a specificity of 0.79  and a sensitivity of 0.90 using a semiquantitative standard loop reference test.  the majority of specimens negative by the automated test but positive by the pour plate reference test were specimens which grew several bacterial species. we suggest that such disagreement was most likely for urine containing around 10(5)  colony-forming units per ml (the culture threshold of positivity) and that these  specimens were ones contaminated by urethral or vaginal flora. we propose standard procedures for calibrating and evaluating rapid or automated methods for the detection of significant bacteriuria and have analyzed our results using these procedures. we recommend that identical analyses should be reported for other evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

TI  == in vitro adherence of bacteria to prosthetic vascular grafts.
AB  == the adherence of staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3h-thymidine to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. enterobacteriaceae adhered to dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. the addition of velour to the dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. in contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. the adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. however, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.

AB  == pulmonary defense mechanisms were quantitated in mice that were fed a protein-free diet (pfd) for periods of 2 and 3 weeks. despite the severe weight loss and emaciation induced by the diet, the bactericidal mechanisms in their lungs were preserved against aerogenic challenges with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and listeria monocytogenes. phagocytic assays of alveolar macrophages that were retrieved by pulmonary lavage from pfd-fed animals showed a decrease in fc receptor-mediated binding activity but no alteration in the ingestion of sensitized erythrocytes. in contrast, the pfd induced defects in both the attachment phase and the engulfment phase of the phagocytic process when the challenge organism was candida krusei. the pfd suppressed the pulmonary inflammatory response after mice were infected with influenza virus strain pr8; such mice also failed to eliminate infectious virus from their lungs. virus infection in control mice suppressed pulmonary antibacterial defenses against challenges with s. aureus and p. mirabilis, and defect that was ameliorated in the lungs of pfd-fed mice with viral pneumonia. the data demonstrated that pulmonary defense mechanisms were modulated by a pfd but that the observed effect was dependent on the agent used to test host defenses.

AB  == persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. the persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. with gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. with gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. inhibitors of protein and rna synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa. the duration of the  postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration  of exposure up to a point of maximal response. persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.

TI  == in vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: ly-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics ly-127935 (ly), cefotaxime (ctx) and cefoperazone (cfp) was examined. ly, ctx and cfp had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis while cfp was less inhibitory than ly or ctx against klebsiella spp.; indole + proteus and gentamicin (gm)-susceptible serratia. ly and ctx were  effective while cfp was inactive against enterobacter spp. and gm-resistant serratia. cfp was more active than ly or ctx against gm-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against gm-resistant isolates. bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to ly than ctx or cfp. combination studies against p. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-gm pairs demonstrated synergy.

TI  == ro 13-9904, a long-acting broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == ro 13-9904, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was found to have high in vitro activity against enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria, including various isolates resistant to cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin.  it showed promising activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. although inhibitory  against staphylococcus aureus at concentrations readily achievable in plasma, it  was less potent against this pathogen than cefamandole, cefazolin, or cefuroxime. isolates of streptococcus faecalis were uniformly resistant to all the cephalosporins tested. ro 13-9904 was more active than cefotaxime against proteus mirabilis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae, but less active against s. aureus. ro 13-9904 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases. its therapeutic efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice was equal to or slightly superior to that of cefotaxime and sce-1365 when the antibiotics were administered in repeated subcutaneous doses after bacterial challenge. cefoperazone, and particularly cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, and mezlocillin were less effective. although structurally related to  cefotaxime and sce-1365, ro 13-9904 was found to differ from them in one important respect, namely, in having a long duration of action; this was observed with single-dose treatment given before bacterial challenge. its broad spectrum of activity coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties make ro 13-9904 a promising compound for clinical studies.

AB  == these gratifying results have made topical antimicrobial sensitivity testing an integral part of bacteriologic monitoring of the burn wound. presently, we use the needle extrusion test routinely on all burn patients at our center. its selection over the other antimicrobial tests is based on technical considerations. the needle extrusion test can be completed by an experienced technician within five minutes, but the disk diffusion test and agar-well diffusion test take two and five times longer, respectively. this time saving is  an important consideration when the microflora of ten or more burn patient at our center are being monitored by this test every other day. this test system may prove useful for the topical antibiotic selection for the treatment of other wounds beside the burn wound. its potential value in these other conditions must  await the results of carefully controlled clinical studies.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis,  indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the  exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid  bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.

AB  == n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than  ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it  a promising new antibiotic.

TI  == bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% h2o2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater  than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of h2o2 (0.6 to  0.01%) were constructed. organisms with high cellular catalase activity (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% h2o2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., and pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. the efficacy of h2o2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation  with bacterial suspensions. h2o2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of h2o2 into urinary drainage bags  may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

AB  == autobac i, a recently introduced semiautomated method for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing, has been evaluated by comparison with the calibrated dichotomous sensitivity disk diffusion technique, which is routinely used in many australian hospitals. only the most common clinical isolates, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., and proteus mirabilis, were included in this evaluation, and an overall interpretive agreement of 93% was obtained. however, an unusually high rate of discrepancy was noted in several organism-antibiotic combinations, in particular e. coli and p. mirabilis with ampicillin, s. aureus with penicillin, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with methicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin. the discrepancies associated with ampicillin have been reduced from 29 and 24% for e. coli and p. mirabilis, respectively, to less than 5% after the utilization of commercial 10-micrograms diffusion disks, in preference to the lower antibiotic content disks supplied by  the autobac manufacturer. furthermore, modifications in the interpretive procedure have eliminated discrepancies associated with s. aureus and penicillin.

TI  == bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

TI  == comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (bl-s 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. one gram-positive strain and six gram-negative strains were used. bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. tests showed that against klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. the number of viable cells of staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. on the other hand, providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.

AB  == the minimal antibiotic concentration (mac) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight  times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to 1/128 of the mic. colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the mic was determined, and the mic:mac ratio,  which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. the mic:mac ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. there is no relation between the mics and the mic:mac ratios. the highest ratios were given by proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (mic:mac mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus faecalis (mic:mac means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

TI  == the recovery period following exposure of bacteria to penicillins.
AB  == experiments with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes have shown that when cells are exposed to bactericidal concentration of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated with beta-lactamase the count of the surviving viable cells (colony-forming units) remains essentially constant for a period of approximately 1.5--3 h before increasing at a normal rate. no such recovery period was observed, however, when escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis was exposed to a bactericidal concentration of ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated. microscopic observation of individual surviving cells of s. aureus following exposure to benzylpenicillin showed that in some cases resumption of cell division was delayed as long as 4 h. however, other cells in the same population showed no recovery period and resumed division within 30 min of inactivation of the antibiotic. in the latter case, the recovery period which is observed in terms of viable count may represent the period of time required for individual surviving cells to divide and give rise to normal aggregates before these fragment to produce new colony-forming units.

AB  == in vitro tests were performed with sch 21420 and sch 22591 to determine (i) their activity in comparison to six other aminoglycosides against 343 clinical isolates, and (ii) whether synergy with penicillin g could be demonstrated with enterococci. in broth dilution tests, sch 22591 was more active than the seven other aminoglycosides against staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. sch 22591 was as active as tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of sch 21420 was comparable to gentamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin but greater than amikacin or kanamycin against s. aureus and most genera of enterobacteriaceae. sch 21420, amikacin, and kanamycin were (i) more active than the other five aminoglycosides  against proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii, but (ii) less active than the  other five aminoglycosides against neisseria gonorrhoeae, enterococci, most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, proteus mirabilis, and proteus morganii. studies on the bactericidal activity of sch 22591 with penicillin indicated a synergistic interaction against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin. this could be demonstrated with combinations containing 3.0 to 6.0 mug of sch 22591 per ml and was comparable to that observed with penicillin/gentamicin. penicillin plus sch 21420 (25 mug/ml) also demonstrated synergy against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin. however, synergy did not occur against strains highly resistant to  kanamycin. these latter results were similar to those obtained in tests with penicillin/kanamycin.

TI  == clinical experience with cefamandole for treatment of serious bone and joint infections.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 30 patients (from 18 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. five of the subjects were children. the antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 2 to 12 g daily for five to 44 days. twenty-six of the 30 patients responded satisfactorily. fourteen of the fifteen infections due to staphylococcus aureus were among the successful cases. other pathogens were streptococci, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and bacteroides fragilis. the drug was well tolerated in patients in this series. studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. further investigation of cefmandole in the treatment of bone and joint infections is warranted.

TI  == management and microbiology of cutaneous abscesses.
AB  == cutaneous abscesses in the perineal region contain primarily anaerobes commonly found in stool. non-perineal abscesses contain mixed microflora indigenous to the skin. bacteroides fragilis, the only anaerobe resistant to penicillin, is found predominantly in the perineal area. staphylococcus aureus, although the most common aerobe found, is seen less frequently than expected and is almost always resistant to penicillin. escherichia coli and neisseria gonorrhoeae are rarely found. incision and drainage is the primary mode of treatment. fever is rare, though tachycardia is common in patients with normal host defenses. patients with altered host defenses may require initial culture and gram-stained smear to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy. the gram-stained smear reliably indicates sterile and mixed abscesses, as well as those containing pure s aureus. incision and drainage alone is the only therapy required in the usual patient. since in these patients antibiotics are not required, initial culture and gram-stained smear are unnecessary.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  == cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. gram-positive cocci, except for streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. strains of haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. strains of pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.

TI  == an overview of results of world-wide clinical trials with cefadroxil.
AB  == cefadroxil, a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, is absorbed similarly by fasted and non-fasted subjects, produces sustained serum levels and is eliminated at a relatively slow rate. these pharmacokinetic properties permit less frequent  and more convenient dosage scheduling than cephalexin and cephradine and consequently greater patient compliance. cefadroxil was evaluated for safety in 1051 patients and for efficacy in 1030 patients. overall it achieved a 91.8% rate of clinical success resulting from 881 complete cures and sixty-five clinical cures. among 363 patients with respiratory tract infections and 471 patients with genito-urinary tract infections, cefadroxil treatment produced 97.5% and 84.5% clinical success, respectively. in the remaining infectious diseases treated, cefadroxil therapy resulted in 99.0% clinical success. cefadroxil eradicated 87%  of 1110 pathogens isolated, among which the most predominant pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis. drug-related side-effects were reported in 7.2% of the patients.

TI  == comparison of in vitro antibacterial activity of three oral cephalosporins: cefaclor, cephalexin, and cephradine.
AB  == cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin, was compared in vitro with cephalexin and cephradine against 233 organisms. evaluations were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar using two inoculum sizes. in agar, cefaclor had greater antibacterial activity than either cephalexin or cephradine against isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhi. all three drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of enterococci, enterobacter species, and indole-positive proteus. cefaclor, however, did exhibit the greatest activity of  the three antibiotics against these organisms. although there was wide variability with respect to test parameters, the broth results generally paralleled the agar results. in nutrient broth a clear separation of the results  with these three cephalosporins was seen with k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and s. typhi. cefaclor was the most active, cephalexin had intermediate activity, and cephradine was the least active. from the data obtained in this in vitro study, it can be concluded that cefaclor, which has a substituted chloro group attached  to the molecule, had increased antibacterial activity over cephalexin and cephradine. comparative clinical trials with cefaclor will determine whether the  differences outlined above are of clinical significance.

AB  == the in vitro activity of netilmicin (sch 20569), a new semisynthetic derivative of gentamicin, was compared with that of gentamicin and amikacin. one hundred and ninety-two clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were tested using both agar and broth dilution techniques.  netilmicin was comparable to gentamicin, with the following exceptions: (i) for serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa, gentamicin was more active than netilmicin; (ii) all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to gentamicin,  were susceptible to netilmicin; (iii) some strains of s. marcescens, indole-positive proteus, and providencia, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin. netilmicin was more active than amikacin for all  enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus and equal to amikacin in activity against gentamicin-susceptible strains of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa, resistant to gentamicin, were also resistant to netilmicin but were susceptible to amikacin. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained with broth and agar showed no significant differences except for p. mirabilis, where broth mics  were twofold greater than agar mics, and for p. aeruginosa, where agar mics were  twofold higher than broth mics. the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) was  either identical to or within one twofold dilution of the mic for the strains tested. a 100-fold increase in inoculum size produced less increase in mic and mbc with netilmicin than with gentamicin or amikacin.

TI  == rational choice of penicillins and cephalosporins based on parallel in-vitro and  in-vivo tests.
AB  == because of the unavailability of strictly comparable data, seven representative penicillins and the five cephalosporins currently used in britain were evaluated  in parallel, both in vitro and in vivo. penicillin sensitive and resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis were the main test organisms. minimum bacteriocidal concentrations of cloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cephalothin, and cephazolin in serum were much higher than conventional minimum inhibitory concentrations in the absence of serum. cephalexin and cephradine showed the smallest divergence in these values. staph, aureus beta-lactamase caused least damage to methicillin and cephradine, whereas enzymes from escherichia, klebsiella, and bacillus cereus had least effect against cephradine  followed by cephalexin. in mouse protection experiments, highly protein-bound antibiotics had relatively low efficacy. cephradine had the highest mean activity followed closely by cephaloridine and cephalexin. from the data, cephradine was the cephalosporin of choice, and firm decisions were also made about the choice of penicillins.

TI  == factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  == the effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus aureus (smith), serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. with p. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum  agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. passive immunity against p. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized p. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. with s. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. these data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. the results further demonstrate that with p. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in  the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.

AB  == cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. studies  were performed in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. at obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. in agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of enterobacter and indole-positive proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive proteus but not enterobacter. moreover, in broth medium most strains of enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in mueller-hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. however, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive proteus. cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of e. coli. these data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive proteus species as well as some other enterobacteriaceae. on the other hand, with the exception of strains of enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and  not in broth.

AB  == one-year surveillance of single and multiple antibiotic resistance of 8 species of so-called "problem bacteria" by computer analysis of data obtained from 18 public health laboratories in slovakia in 1973 enables to establish the most frequently occuring spectra of multiple drug resistance which would point to the  spread of typical r plasmids among the problem bacteria investigated. as an introduction, we surveyed the mode of testing of problem bacteria in individual phls against antibiotics - drugs of choice. iw was important to find out whether  strains belonging to problem bacteria investigated are tested against sufficient  number of antibacterial drugs. our study shows that the percentage of bi- and multiple drug resistance in almost all bacterial species investigated depend on the number of antibiotics used in tests in vitro as single discs. the more antibiotic discs are used to test the strains, the more chance the laboratory has to register the true picture of multiresistance to antibiotics. our study also shows that the testing in the phls associated to the computer study in this respect is inadequate. moreover, the increasing complexity and proportion of multiple drug resistance in problem bacteria - with a notable exception of salmonellae - forces the phls to use more and more discs so that using two petri  dishes full of discs - 12 to 15 discs - begins to be necessary in testing of most of the problem bacteria under investigation.

AB  == as the results of laboratory and clinical investigation with a new tetracycline derivate, pt-122m (doxycycline) was performed with the results which may lead to  the following conclusions. 1) in vitro antibacterial activity: the minimal inhibitory concentration of doxycycline (dotc) was measured by an agar plate dilution method. the mic of dotc against 60 strains of coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus isolated from otorrhoea was distributed over a range of 0.2 approximately 1.56 mcg/ml and 12.5 approximately 50 mcg/ml. furthermore, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella pneumoniae was 3.13 to 100 mcg/ml. 2) concentration in blood: the blood level of dotc in healthy adults who  were given 100 mg of dotc intravenous reached maximum of 1.97 mcg/ml on the average 15 minutes after injection. even at 12 hours after intravenous injection  clinically effective serum dotc concentration of 0.47 mcg/ml was still demonstrable. 3) clinical results: pt-122m (doct) was intravenously injected into 30 cases with typical infection in the field of otorhinolaryngology. it was excellent in 15 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 3 cases, and poor in 2 cases. when the cases in which it was excellent and good were considered together, good  results were obtained in 25 cases, a ratio of effectiveness being 83 per cent. 4) side effect: the comparative examination of hepatic function, electrolyte and auditory acuity before and after injection showed no significant disturbance. no  side effect was shown with the intravenous injection.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == the pulmonary response to a bacteremic challenge.
AB  == the pulmonary response to a bacteremic challenge was studied in a mouse model. the distribution of intravenously injected radiotracer-labeled proteus mirabilis  and staphylococcus aureus in the lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, and blood was examined at 0, 5 30, 60, and 240 min. pulmonary killing of these organisms was studied at 0, 30, and 240 min; 0.8 plus or minus 0.1 per cent of the p. mirabilis and 1.5 plus or minus 0.2 per cent of the s. aureus remained within the lungs after 4 hours. although only 2.2 plus or minus 0.2 per cent of the p. mirabilis organisms were alive, 33.8 plus or minus 8.8 per cent of the staphylococci remained viable after this period. light and electron micographs verified that polymorphonuclear leukocytes phagocytized these bacteria. the defense mechanisms  of the lung against bloodborne and airborne bacterial infection are functionally, as well as morphologically, distinct.

TI  == the varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
AB  == in this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were first determined against each  of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, sulfamylon, and betadine). then the sensitivity of each organism  growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. the changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. sulfamylon, was associated  with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. it is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they  more closely simulate the real clinical situation. therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from  patients at national taiwan university hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against  gram-positive bacteria except enterococci. staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. more than 90% of staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. the relative potency of cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus  in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. the gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative  pathogens tested. the relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against e. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. one hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. the sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.

AB  == data accumulating routinely in a hospital microbiology laboratory were computer-plotted according to the number of days the patient had been in the hospital when each culture was obtained. the rate at which patients were cultured fell slightly during hospitalization, while the rate at which isolates were obtained from them increased gradually. for some species, such as escherichia coli or staphylococcus aureus, isolation rates changed little during hospitalization. they rose as much as sevenfold for other species, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or serratia marcescens, or for a particular antibiotype of klebsiella pneumoniae while it was an endemic nosocomial problem. these differences persisted after deletion of repeat isolates from the same patient. they appeared to reflect general shifts in composition of patient flora during hospitalization. these shifts paralleled shifts in infecting flora as represented by similar plots of isolates from blood cultures.

TI  == cefoxitin, a new semi-synthetic cephamycin: an in-vitro and in-vivo comparison with cephalothin.

TI  == immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity in murine virus pneumonia.
AB  == bacterial multiplication in the lung associated with murine sendai virus pneumonia is caused by virus-induced defects in pulmonary bactericidal mechanisms. the nature of this effect has been studied in animals immunized against the challenge bacteria. mice were immunized against proteus mirabilis by  intraperitoneal inoculation and by aerosol inhalation. after the development of immunity, mice were infected aerogenically with 10(4) tcid(50) of sendai virus. 7 days later, during the height of the bronchial inflammation and pulmonary consolidation, the mice were challenged with an aerosol of viable (35)s-labeled proteus mirabilis or (32)p-labeled staphylococcus aureus.nonimmunized virus-infected animals showed marked impairment of pulmonary bactericidal activity with subsequent multiplication of the bacterial strain in the case of proteus mirabilis. immunized nonvirus-infected animals showed enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity for the homologous and heterologous strains in comparison with nonimmunized animals. virus-infected animals immunized by aerosol showed enhanced bactericidal activity against the homologous but not the heterologous bacterial strain. neither virus infection nor immunization had a significant effect on the transport of particles in the lung. the data demonstrated that the bacterial multiplication associated with the virus pneumonia was prevented by preceding immunization against the homologous challenge organism. the data suggest a mechanism for controlling bacterial multiplication associated with virus pneumonias.

AB  == igg with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, proteus  mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to  igg antibacterial antibody preparations. opsonic human igg obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. in vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of i(-)  and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, s. aureus, p. mirabilis, and e. coli. however, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of p. aeruginosa. bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated igg preparations. antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. these in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.

TI  == effect of hypersensitivity pneumonitis on the pulmonary defense mechanisms of guinea pig lungs.
AB  == many edemagenic and consolidating inflammatory diseases, such as virus pneumonias, of the lung are complicated by bacterial infection. previous literature has stressed that edema and consolidation may promote bacterial proliferation by interfering with phagocytosis. to test that hypothesis, lung defense mechanisms were studied in guinea pigs with tuberculin-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a noninfectious edemagenic, and consolidating inflammatory disease. pulmonary bactericidal activity and particle clearance were measured with a mixed aerosol of (32)p-labeled staphylococcus aureus and(35)s-labeled proteus mirabilis. hypersensitivity pneumonitis enhanced the bactericidal activity of the lung but had no effect on particle clearance despite the presence of consolidation and edema. these data indicate that altered host resistance to bacterial infection in acute inflammatory lung diseases can not be  attributed to edema, inflammation, consolidation, changes in lung weight, etc., per se and that causes must be sought in functional changes in the bactericidal system of the lung rather than in specific histopathological changes.

AB  == amoxicillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin which is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci (except penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus) and most isolates of proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. its in vitro activity is quite similar to ampicillin, but it produces higher serum levels after oral administration. the mean peak serum levels of amoxicillin in 11 normal volunteers were 2.30 mug/ml after 125 mg, 3.43 mug/ml after 250 mg, 6.75 mug/ml after 500 mg, and 9.90 mug/ml after 1 g. about 70% of the drug was excreted in the urine during the first 6 hr.

TI  == evaluation of a new cephalosporin antibiotic, cephapirin.
AB  == cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. at a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. however, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas were inhibited. a 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. all penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. the drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as  well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative  culture during therapy. a single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis.  two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. the drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. no abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. in addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. if further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.

TI  == 7-(alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridinothio)-acetamido) cephalosporanic acid.
AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == clinical and in vitro evaluation of cephapirin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  == cephapirin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and in 27 patients. cephapirin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against 25 strains each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus; 10 strains each of diplococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas species, and enterobacter species; and 8 strains of proteus species other than p. mirabilis. all strains of s. aureus and d. pneumoniae and most strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus species were inhibited by concentrations of cephapirin achieved in the serum. of 27 patients (20 with pneumonia, 2 with s. aureus empyema, and 5 with miscellaneous infections), 25 responded to cephapirin  therapy. the only major toxicity thought to be drug-related occurred in a patient who developed reversible bone marrow depression with leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. although cephapirin was painful on intramuscular injection, phlebitis and pain were absent in patients treated intravenously. in a controlled comparison of intravenously administered cephalothin and cephapirin in four additional patients, the latter caused much less pain than the former and caused no phlebitis.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

TI  == epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  == epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. these included single strains of streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, salmonella schottmuelleri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. in oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. the concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.

TI  == in vitro activity of coumermycin a1.
AB  == the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against staphylococcus aureus. it was about 50 times more  active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. coumermycin also showed good activity against group a streptococci and pneumococci, moderate  activity against escherichia coli, indole-positive proteus species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against klebsiella-enterobacter and enterococci. against p. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. the new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin c antibiotic.
AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

TI  == antibacterial mechanisms of the urinary bladder.
AB  == the disappearance of bacteria from the normal urinary bladder is apparently a function of two host defense mechanisms: the mechanical clearance of organisms by voiding, and the antibacterial activity of the bladder wall. this study quantified the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to the resistance of the bladder to bacterial infection.(32)phosphorus-labeled e. coli.  s. aureus, and p. mirabilis were each injected into the urinary bladders of unanesthetized female guinea pigs. at intervals after voiding, the bladders were  removed, washed, homogenized, and assayed for residual radioactivity and viable bacteria. mechanical clearance was measured by the changes in total radioactive count. antibacterial activity was quantified by comparing the bacterial to radioactive ratios of the original bacterial inoculum with similar ratios in the  bladder homogenates. more than 99.9% of the bladder inoculum was rapidly excreted and about 0.1% (10(4)-10(5)) organisms remained attached to the bladder wall. of  those e. coli attached to the bladder, rapid sequential reduction in viability occurred and reached a level of 85% loss at 30 min after inoculation. 4 hr after  challenge, less than 10% of those organisms still attached to the bladder mucosa  remained viable. p. mirabilis was handled with equal facility, but s. aureus showed a reduction in viability of only 46% at 1 hr and 67% at 4 hr after inoculation. 6 hr after infection with s. aureus, 6 of 12 guinea pig bladders showed multiplication of the organisms still attached to the bladder wall; only 1 of 12 animals challenged with e. coli had comparable multiplication. the mechanism whereby the bladder wall kills bacteria is unclear, but it did not appear to be related to an antibacterial activity of urine, clumping of organisms on bladder mucosa, phagocytosis by leukocytes, or serum levels of bactericidal antibody. although it is clear that the bladder exhibits intrinsic antibacterial  properties, the role of this defense mechanism in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection requires further clarification.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  == serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus  strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were  inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were  more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.

TI  == effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == in an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in mueller-hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, aerobacter, klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis. a variety of different antibiotics were investigated. with 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. therefore, despite minor variations when  the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that mueller-hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. a simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is  described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by  the more arduous plate dilution test.

TI  == direct method for determining the viability of a freshly generated mixed bacterial aerosol.
AB  == a direct method was developed to determine the viability of a freshly generated mixed bacterial aerosol. a mixed suspension of (32)p-labeled staphylococcus aureus and (35)s-labeled proteus mirabilis was nebulized, and the aerosol was collected and separated according to particle size with an andersen sampler. quantitative and qualitative bacteriological and radioisotopic techniques were used to obtain ratios of bacterial to radioactive counts for each organism in samples of the nebulizer suspension and aerosol. loss of viability was calculated from the change that occurred between the ratio of the nebulizer suspension and the ratio of the aerosol. the viability of s. aureus was unaffected by aerosolization, whereas the viability of p. mirabilis declined by 20 to 60% and was inversely proportional to particle size. the advantages of this method over present indirect methods, as well as potential applications of the method, are discussed.

TI  == role of lipid in the protection of staphylococcus aureus against trichlorophenol  in mixed culture.
AB  == the sensitivities of proteus mirabilis, salmonella schottmuelleri, aerobacter aerogenes, and staphylococcus aureus to 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol in sodium borate  were studied. it was demonstrated that these gram-negative organisms can protect  s. aureus from the effect of the phenol in mixed culture. there is a direct correlation between this protective effect and the quantity of total lipid extracted from the gram-negative organisms. the distribution coefficient between  trichlorophenol and the lipid of the cells is related to the sensitivity and capacity to protect s. aureus in mixed culture. hydrogen bonding between the cell's lipid and the phenolic compound is discussed as a possible mechanism which determines a cell's response to the inhibitor.

TI  == a new selective blood agar medium for streptococcus pyogenes and other haemolytic streptococci.
AB  == horse blood agar containing polymyxin b sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of staph. aureus, ps. pyocyanea, proteus mirabilis, e.  coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, str. pyogenes. in a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (p.n.f.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with str. pyogenes; p.n.f. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of str. pyogenes  from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. haemolytic streptococci of groups a, c, d, g, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on p.n.f. medium than on blood 4% agar. viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on p.n.f. medium. these limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

TI  == the role of the alveolar macrophage in the clearance of bacteria from the lung.
AB  == pulmonary clearance of bacteria was studied using histologic, bacteriologic, and  radiotracer methods. when mice were exposed to an aerosol of p(32)-tagged staphylococcus aureus or proteus mirabilis, and the rate of disappearance of viable bacteria compared with the rate of their mechanical removal, it was found  that bacterial viability declined 80 to 90 per cent in 4 hours, whereas radioactivity declined by only 14 to 20 per cent. the marked disparity in these rates indicated that mechanical removal comprised a relatively small fraction of  the total clearing process. the in situ bactericidal action of the lung predominated over the mechanical removal process in achieving clearance of the inhaled bacteria. by immunofluorescent methods, the inhaled bacteria were found to be localized in the alveolar spaces and within alveolar macrophages. these observations suggest that the bactericidal action of the bronchopulmonary tree is due primarily to the phagocytic activity of the alveolar macrophages, and that the action of the mucociliary stream, in relation to bacterial particles, may be  largely related to the transport from the lung of phagocytes containing material  of bacterial origin.

AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
