TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.
