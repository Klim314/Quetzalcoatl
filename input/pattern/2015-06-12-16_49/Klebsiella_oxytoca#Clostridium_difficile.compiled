TI  - Active surveillance for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae using stool specimens submitted for testing for Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Active surveillance to identify asymptomatic carriers of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a recommended strategy for CRE control in healthcare facilities. Active surveillance using stool specimens tested for Clostridium difficile is a relatively low-cost strategy to detect CRE carriers. Further evaluation of this and other risk factor-based active surveillance strategies is warranted.
TI  - [Nosocomial diarrhea in intensive care unit: other than Clostridium difficile].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical features of non-Clostridium  difficile (C. difficile) associated nosocomial diarrhea in intensive care unit (ICU) caused by Klebsiella oxytoca and Clostridium perfringens. METHODS: The faeces of 102 patients with non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea in ICU of West China Hospital, were collected during April to November, 2012. The target bacterial genes were detected by PCR amplification and sequencing, including toxic gene pehX of Klebsiella oxytoca, species-specific 16S rRNA gene and toxic gene cpa and cpe of Clostridium perfringens, species-specific 16S rRNA gene with mapA and toxic gene hipO of Campylobacter jejuni. Clinical features of the patients with positive results were summarized. RESULTS: Among 102 patients with non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea, 4 patients (3.9%) were detected with toxic Klebsiella oxytoca while 4 patients (3.9%) were detected with toxic Clostridium perfringens. No toxic Campylobacter jejuni was detected. Most of the patients had severe underlying diseases and poor final outcome, accepted potent antibiotics which disturbed intestinal flora obviously.. CONCLUSION: Non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea in ICU caused by Klebsiella oxytoca is and Clostridium perfringens is associated with severe diseases and poor outcome, but the incidence in our hospital is relatively low in our hospital.
TI  - [The hot point and controversy of clinical measures in critical are medicine].
AB  - With its powerful ability to monitoring and support of organs, the survival rate  of critically ill patients has been improved significantly by critical care medicine. Critical ill patients centralized in ICU accepted the treatments given by multidisciplinary team as a mode have played a very important role, especially during the rescue of victims in public health emergencies and natural disasters. Changings of the measures of monitoring and support are always along with the development of the critical care medicine. Fluid therapy is the most core measures in ICU, but there is a significant contradiction between positive fluid therapy and patient's impaired organ compensatory ability. The premise of appropriate fluid therapy is continuous and accurate evaluation of the hemodynamic status of critical ill patients. The variation of peak velocity of common carotid artery measured by bedside ultrasound can estimate the volume status of the SICU patients accurately. This method has high feasibility and accuracy and easy to be handled by the residents of ICU. The non-C. difficile associated nosocomial diarrhea even fatal enteritis in ICU can be caused by Klebsiella oxytoca and Clostridium perfringens. Although this kind of incidence occurs in a relatively low rate, it always associates with severe diseases and poor outcome. Analgesia and sedation had become routine measures in ICU. There is still great controversy in some of the sedation protocol, such as sedation level and wake up daily. More and more evidence-based data suggested taking appropriate sedation targeting to individuals, and the protocol should be integrated with the dealing of pain, anxiety and delirium.
TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in clinical practice].
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is considered to mean at least 3 shapeless stool episodes within 2 or more consecutive days when using antibacterial agents. Due to the fact that antibiotics are used most commonly to treat many diseases, AAD is one of the topical problems for different clinical specialists. There has recently been increased interest in this condition due to its higher morbidity and mortality rates and the emergence of novel treatment-resistant virulent strains of Clostridium difficile 027 and 078/126. The paper discusses the possible risk of developing AAD depending on the class of the antibiotic used, as well as the mechanisms of its development. Infectious diarrhea most frequently results from bacterial overgrowth due to that the obligate intestinal microflora is suppressed by antibacterial drugs. C. difficile, Clostridium perfringers, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Candida spp. are etiological factors in the development of this diarrhea. The severest intestinal lesions include pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) caused by C. difficile. The clinical and endoscopic picture and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of PMC are described. Therapy for this menacing condition is traditionally based on the use of metronidazole and vancomycin. In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the new drug fidaxomycin whose superiority over vancomycin has been demonstrated by a recurrence criterion. The paper discusses in detail other treatment options, including the use of probiotics.
TI  - [Acute infectious diarrhea in adults: epidemiology and management].
AB  - Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days. More than three millions cases of acute diarrhea, presumably due to intestinal infections, are seen in general practice every year in France. Most of the cases are benign and resolve under symptomatic treatment within 3 days, without need for biological tests or antibiotics. In special contexts (septicemic syndrome, visible blood in stools, severe dehydration, patients at risk of severe sepsis [valvulopathy]), biologic tests and probabilist antibiotic treatment are required. Hygiene, rehydration and diet recommendations are always part of the treatment of acute diarrhea, in addition to the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea and other digestive symptoms. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea is clinically benign in most cases, and attributed to transient dysbiosis of gut microbiota. In the remaining cases, diarrhea is the clinical expression of intestinal infection by Clostridium difficile, that should be treated with metronidazole, or the clinical expression of a Klebsiella oxytoca-associated colitis that usually spontaneously resolves after stopping antibiotics.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. We review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. Clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. Apart from Clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. Here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for C. difficile are negative.
TI  - Prospective observational study on antibiotic-associated bloody diarrhea: report  of 21 cases with a long-term follow-up from Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis is a distinct form of antibiotic-associated bloody diarrhea (AABD) in which Clostridium difficile is absent. Although the cause is not exactly known, reports have suggested the role of Klebsiella oxytoca and/or C. difficile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and 2006, stool samples of 21 consecutive patients with AABD were cultured for common enteric pathogens and K. oxytoca, and were tested for the presence of parasites and C. difficile toxin A+B within the first 24 h of their initial admission and a colonoscopy was performed when available. The patients were followed up prospectively by telephone interviews. RESULTS: The occurrence of symptoms ranged between 6 h and 14 days following the first dose of the antibiotic responsible and the duration of the AABD ranged between 6 h and 21 days. The antibiotic responsible was oral ampicillin/sulbactam in 18 (85%) cases. C. difficile toxin A+B production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and K. oxytoca growth in stool cultures were detected in six (29%) and 11 (51%) of 21 patients, respectively. Endoscopic morphology and histology in a limited number of patients revealed no more than a nonspecific inflammation and acute colitis, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis, as a distinct entity in relation to K. oxytoca, is seen in half of the patients with AABD. Most of the cases are seen within a week following the antibiotic use. Almost all of the patients did not develop any flares during the long-term antibiotic-free follow-up. In some of the patients with AABD, there was coexistence of K. oxytoca with C. difficile toxin A+B.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis caused by cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - Klebsiella oxytoca was recently described as the causative organism for antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). It is currently not known if this novel gastrointestinal infection exists in children. AAHC is usually preceded by antibiotic treatment with penicillins, which are frequently prescribed for pediatric patients. In contrast to colitis caused by Clostridium difficile, colitis caused by K oxytoca is usually segmental and located predominantly in the right colon. Patients with AAHC typically present with abdominal pain and almost always bloody diarrhea. We present here the case of an adolescent patient who developed acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea after antibiotic treatment for acute urinary infection with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Right-sided colitis was verified by abdominal sonography. Stool culture tested negative for common gastrointestinal pathogens but yielded K oxytoca. Toxin production of the isolated strain was verified in a cell-culture assay. Cessation of the causative antibiotic treatment led to rapid improvement and cessation of bloody diarrhea within 3 days. We report here the first (to our knowledge) pediatric case of K oxytoca infection causing AAHC. Establishing the diagnosis of AAHC by culturing K oxytoca and demonstrating right-sided colitis with noninvasive imaging studies might prevent unnecessary invasive procedures in children with bloody diarrhea.
TI  - Nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea caused by organisms other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Most cases of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are caused by alteration of the physiological gut microflora. This alteration leads to reduced microbial metabolism of carbohydrates and primary bile acids, resulting in osmotic or secretory forms of diarrhoea. Moreover, facultative enteropathogens may experience a growth advantage due to the antibiotic-induced microflora alteration that, in turn, can harm the gut mucosa by the toxins they produce. Clostridium difficile is the major infectious agent leading to pseudomembranous colitis. However, there is increasing evidence that certain other pathogens such as enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca can induce mucosal deterioration and diarrhoea after antibiotic use. But, as with C. difficile, these facultative enteropathogens can also be found in the healthy population. Their contribution to disease is, therefore, controversial and their presence in the stools of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea patients is often claimed to be mere colonisation. In this respect, the causal relationship of each suspected pathogen with the development of intestinal disease has to be proved clinically and experimentally.
TI  - A study of the prevalence of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic Klebsiella oxytoca fecal colonization in two patient populations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella oxytoca is a cause of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Few reports of the occurrence of K oxytoca within stool exist and there is no gold standard method for its isolation. METHODS: MacConkey agar was modified to culture K oxytoca. Ampicillin was added and adonitol was substituted for lactose. Rectal swabs from 200 patients being screened for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and stool specimens from 429 patients who tested negative for Clostridium difficile cytotoxin were cultured. K oxytoca isolates were evaluated for cytotoxicity to HEp-2 cells. Available charts of K oxytoca-positive patients and a convenience sample of 93 K oxytoca-negative patients who underwent testing for C difficile cytotoxicity were reviewed retrospectively for documentation of bloody stool. RESULTS: K oxytoca was isolated from 14 of 200 patients (7.0%) being screened for VRE; only one of the 14 isolates (7.1%) was cytotoxic. The organism was isolated from 42 of 429 patients (9.8%) tested for C difficile cytotoxicity; 10 isolates (23.8%) were cytotoxic. Differences in isolation and cytotoxicity rates between groups were not statistically significant. Two of 13 (15.4%) K oxytoca-positive patients screened for VRE, three of 27 (11.1%) K oxytoca-positive patients tested for C difficile cytotoxicity, and 11 of 93 (11.8%) patients from the convenience sample had documented bloody stool. CONCLUSIONS: A medium that greatly facilitates isolation of K oxytoca was developed. Occurrence of K oxytoca colonization was similar in the two patient populations studied and isolation of cytotoxic K oxytoca was not usually associated with hematochezia. Current understanding of the occurrence and causality of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis is insufficient for clinical laboratories to begin culturing K oxytoca and testing for cytotoxicity.
TI  - Role of Klebsiella oxytoca in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella oxytoca was recently shown to be the causative agent of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Because it is unclear whether K. oxytoca also causes nonhemorrhagic antibiotic-associated diarrhea, our study investigated a possible association between K. oxytoca and that disorder. METHODS: A total of 371 consecutive patients were recruited into 4 study groups: (1) group A+D+ (patients who received antibiotics and experienced diarrhea; n = 107), (2) group A+D- (patients who received antibiotics but did not experience diarrhea; np93), (3) group A-D+ (patients who experienced acute-onset diarrhea but did not receive antibiotics; n = 60), and (4) group A-D- (patients without diarrhea who did not receive antibiotics; n = 111). Stool samples were plated on MacConkey agar and K. oxytoca was identified using a standard test kit. Clostridium difficile was detected by a toxin A/B antigen test. K. oxytoca strains were tested for cytotoxicity with use of cell-culture assays. RESULTS: In 15 of 371 stool samples, K. oxytoca strains were isolated during the study period. There was no significant difference in the distribution of K. oxytoca among the 4 study groups. Six of the 15 strains were found to be toxin producing. Three of the toxin-producing strains caused antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. No case of nonhemorrhagic antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to toxin-producing K. oxytoca was detected. CONCLUSION: K. oxytoca is not the causative agent of nonhemorrhagic antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This is in contrast to the distinct clinical entity of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Testing for K. oxytoca is therefore only warranted for patients who experience bloody diarrhea during antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea].
AB  - Most of the cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea are benign, self-limited and  presumably related to functional consequences of the alteration of gut microflora. In few cases, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of the cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the community, most of the cases of antibiotic-associated colitis, and almost all the cases of pseudomembranous colitis. According to anatomoclinical increasing severity of the disease, C. difficile infections should be treated with metronidazole, vancomycin, intravenous immunoglobulins or colectomy. Klebsiella oxytoca is naturally resistant to bela-lactamins and causes occasionally heamorrhagic colitis, mimicking in some cases ischemic colitis.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of AAD cases. However, Klebsiella oxytoca, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida species might also contribute to AAD. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a C. difficile toxin A assay in patients with AAD between May and December 2005. In addition, we performed the C. difficile toxin A assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. Patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. RESULTS: Among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, M:F =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and 13.2% (5/38) for the C. difficile toxin A assay. The overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). Of the five patients that had a positive result by the C. difficile toxin A assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. The organisms isolated from the stool cultures were C difficile (4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (3), Candida species (3), and Staphylococcus aureus (1). C. difficile (4) and K. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. CONCLUSIONS: For C. difficile negative AAD patients, K. pneumoniae, Candida species and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.
TI  - Clostridium difficile-negative antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis: the role of cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  
TI  - Amoxicillin-associated hemorrhagic colitis in the presence of Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - Antibiotic-induced diarrhea can be a significant source of morbidity. Pseudomembranous colitis, or Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), is an increasingly reported adverse effect of therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics and can prolong the hospital stay of affected patients. Although sharing some of the same clinical symptoms as CDAD, antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis is a distinctly separate form of colitis that is characterized by the absence of toxin-producing C. difficile and the presence of hematochezia. Colonoscopy usually reveals extensive hemorrhage and inflammation in the lamina propria, with lack of pseudomembranes. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs shortly after cessation of the antibiotic. Infection with Klebsiella oxytoca, a gram-negative facultative aerobic enterobacterium, has been suggested as a possible cause for antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Some K. oxytoca strains isolated from patients with antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis produce a cytotoxin that can induce epithelial cell death and may predispose certain patients to hemorrhagic colitis during exposure to antibiotics. We describe a patient who developed hemorrhagic colitis shortly after starting a course of amoxicillin therapy for sinusitis prophylaxis. His stool samples were negative for C. difficile antigens but grew K. oxytoca. The patient received supportive care in conjunction with antibiotic coverage consisting of metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam. He improved throughout his hospital stay and was discharged on hospital day 11. Given the increasing concern for CDAD, clinicians should be careful not to overlook other possible causes for antibiotic-induced diarrhea.
TI  - Antibiotic associated diarrhoea: infectious causes.
AB  - Nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (AAD) is caused by Clostridium difficile, making it the commonest identified and treatable pathogen. Other pathogens implicated infrequently include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida spp. and Salmonella spp. Most mild cases of AAD are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. The antibiotics most frequently associated with C. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for C. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin B. Commercial ELISA kits are available. Though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. Withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. For severe cases of AAD, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice. Probiotics have been used for recurrent cases.
TI  - Klebsiella oxytoca as a causative organism of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis is a distinct form of antibiotic-associated colitis in which Clostridium difficile is absent. Although the cause is not known, previous reports have suggested a role of Klebsiella oxytoca. METHODS: We studied 22 consecutive patients who had suspected antibiotic-associated colitis and who were negative for C. difficile. Patients underwent diagnostic colonoscopy, and among those who received a diagnosis of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis, stool samples were cultured for K. oxytoca. We isolated K. oxytoca strains and tested them for cytotoxin production using a tissue-culture assay. In addition, we also cultured stool samples obtained from 385 healthy subjects for K. oxytoca. An in vivo animal model for antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis was established with the use of Sprague-Dawley rats. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients, 6 had findings on colonoscopy that were consistent with the diagnosis of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis, and 5 of these 6 patients had positive cultures for K. oxytoca. No other common enteric pathogens were found in the five patients. Before the onset of colitis, all five were receiving penicillins, and two were also taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). All isolated K. oxytoca strains produced cytotoxin. K. oxytoca was found in 1.6% of the healthy subjects. In the animal model, K. oxytoca was found only in the colon of rats that received amoxicillin-clavulanate in addition to being inoculated with K. oxytoca. In these rats, infection with K. oxytoca induced a right-sided hemorrhagic colitis that was not observed in uninfected animals that received amoxicillin-clavulanate, indomethacin (an NSAID), or both. CONCLUSIONS: Our fulfillment of Koch's postulates for cytotoxin-producing K. oxytoca suggests that it is the causative organism in at least some cases of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Infection with K. oxytoca should be considered in patients with antibiotic-associated colitis who are negative for C. difficile.
TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea].
AB  - The incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) differs with the antibiotic and varies from 15 - 25 %. Most cases of AAD are directly or indirectly caused by alterations of gut microflora by the antibiotics resulting in clinically mild AAD cases due to functional disturbances of intestinal carbohydrate or bile acid metabolism. Alternatively, changes in the gut flora allow pathogens to proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for 10 - 15 % of all cases of AAD and almost of all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembraneous colitis. There is also a growing body of evidence which supports the responsibility of Klebsiella oxytoca for the development of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis. Diagnosing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea should be based both on fecal-cytotoxin detection and culture. With respect to specific therapy, metronidazol has become the first choice whereas treatment with oral vancomycin should be reserved for patients who have contraindications or intolerance to or who have failed to respond to metronidazole. Probiotics such as Sacharomyces boulardii can reduce the risk of development. Restrictive antibiotic policies (e. g. restricting clindamycin and cephalosporins) and the implementation of a comprehensive hospital infection control have also been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of AAD.
TI  - Microbial-gut interactions in health and disease. Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Most cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) are directly or indirectly due to the alteration of gut microflora by antibiotics. 'Functional' diarrhoea, usually limited to a mild and brief change in stool frequency, is considered as the most frequent pattern of AAD. Reduced carbohydrate fermentation and impaired metabolism of bile acids have been claimed as the potential causes of this transient digestive discomfort but a critical analysis of the data supporting these theories is necessary. Alternatively, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of cases of AAD and almost all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. The level of evidence which supports the potential responsibility of other candidate pathogens (Klebsiella oxytoca, enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus, Candida) needs to be appreciated according to the updated postulates of causality relationships between a bacterium and a disease.
TI  - Klebsiella oxytoca as an agent of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Klebsiella oxytoca has been isolated from stools and colonic biopsy specimens of patients with Clostridium difficile-negative antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC), but the pathogenic role of the germ has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of K. oxytoca in patients with AAHC from a prospective cohort of patients with acute colitis, and to test the cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells of K. oxytoca strains from patients with AAHC and healthy carriers. METHODS: Colonic biopsy specimens and a sample of colonic fluid from 93 consecutive patients with acute colitis were cultured on selective media for 7 established pathogens and K. oxytoca. The 2 K. oxytoca strains isolated in the 4 patients with C. difficile-negative AAHC of this cohort and 105 additional K. oxytoca strains from patients with C. difficile-negative AAHC (n = 15) and healthy carriers (n = 90) were tested for cytotoxicity using a HEp-2 cell culture assay. RESULTS: K. oxytoca was isolated in 50% (2 of 4) of the patients of the prospective cohort with C. difficile-negative AAHC compared with 2% (1 of 41) of the patients with acute colitis caused by established pathogens (P = 0.02). The rate of cytotoxic strains of K. oxytoca was higher in patients with AAHC (82%) than in healthy carriers (42%, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that K. oxytoca is isolated with a significant high rate in patients with C. difficile-negative AAHC, and that K. oxytoca strains from patients with AAHC are cytotoxic more frequently on HEp-2 cells than strains from healthy carriers. These results strengthen the hypothesis of a causative role of K. oxytoca in some of the patients with AAHC.
TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the elderly].
AB  - PURPOSE: Most of the antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) cases result from a transient disturbance in the function of the normal intestinal flora and are spontaneously solved when discontinuing the antibacterial therapy. However, a mild diarrhea lasting several days may induce a dehydration or worsen a denutrition in frail elderly people. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: The incidence of AAD varies between 5 and 25% depending on the concerned antibiotic. Only 10-20% of all AAD cases are caused by infection, especially with Clostridium difficile, for which advanced age is a major risk factor. The first biological exam to perform when severe AAD or in frail people is the detection of C. difficile toxins, especially in elderly patient treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Nevertheless, other infectious organisms causing AAD may be considered, as Staphylococcus aureus when predominant in stool cultures from patients treated with fluoroquinolones or as Klebsiella oxytoca when isolated in bloody diarrhea from patients treated with ampicillin. Elevated fecal counts of Candida spp. found in patients treated with antibiotics is rather the consequence of therapy than the cause of AAD. The prevention of AAD is based on a rational antibiotic use to avoid endogenous selection of C. difficile and on the improvement of the hygiene measures to limit the exogenous transmission of the bacteria or related spores by spoiled hands. FUTURE PROSPECTS: Simultaneous prescription of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal flora, should be better described, especially in elderly people, because of its important economic impact.
TI  - Can quinolones cause hemorrhagic colitis of late onset? Report of three cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to demonstrate that quinolones may cause acute colitis resembling penicillin-induced hemorrhagic colitis. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with acute colitis in our institutes. Twenty-eight patients with acute hemorrhagic colitis in which no pathogenic microorganisms were identified were the subjects of this study. Pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile was excluded. Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and radiation proctocolitis were also excluded. RESULTS: Among these patients, 25 had a history of recent administration of penicillin derivatives. The remaining three patients had never been given any penicillin derivatives, but had ingested quinolones approximately four weeks before the developing colitis had been identified. Klebsiella oxytoca was also isolated in these three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Quinolones may cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. The time interval from antibiotic ingestion to onset of the condition may be much longer in quinolones than in penicillin derivatives.
TI  - Comparative value of colonic biopsy and intraluminal fluid culture for diagnosis  of bacterial acute colitis in immunocompetent patients. Infectious Colitis Study Group.
AB  - We compared the yield of intraluminal fluid culture to that of biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy for the diagnosis of bacterial colitis in 93 immunocompetent patients with a recent episode of diarrhea and macroscopic lesions of colitis. Stool culture findings were also available for 68 patients. At least one bacterial pathogen was isolated from the biopsy specimen, intraluminal fluid, or stool from 48 patients (51.6%). Salmonella species, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella oxytoca, Shigella species, and Campylobacter species were recovered from 16 (17.2%), 15 (16.1%), 8 (8.6%), 7 (7.5%), and 4 (4.3%) of the patients, respectively. One Shigella species and one K. oxytoca strain were isolated from biopsy specimens but not from intraluminal fluid, and intraluminal fluid was the only positive specimen in 12 cases (yielding 1 Salmonella species, 2 Shigella species, 2 K. oxytoca, and 7 C. difficile isolates). In nine cases out of 10, toxin B was detected only in intraluminal fluid. A correlation of 91.2% was observed between stool and intraluminal fluid cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species isolations. Culture of biopsy specimens adds little to the diagnosis of infectious colitis, and stools and intraluminal fluids appear to have comparable value.
TI  - Mechanisms and management of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - Only 10%-20% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are caused by infection with Clostridium difficile. Other infectious organisms causing AAD include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida species, and Salmonella species. Most of the clinically mild AAD cases are due to functional disturbances of intestinal carbohydrate or bile acid metabolism, to allergic and toxic effects of antibiotics on intestinal mucosa, or to pharmacological effects on motility. Saccharomyces boulardii and Enterococcus SF68 can reduce the risk of developing AAD. Patients receiving antibiotic treatment should avoid food containing high amounts of poorly absorbable carbohydrates. Mild cases of AAD that may or may not be caused by C. difficile can be resolved by discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and by dietary carbohydrate reduction. Only severe AAD caused by C. difficile requires specific antibiotic treatment.
TI  - [Drug-associated hemorrhagic enteritis].
AB  - Drug-associated hemorrhagic colitis are divided into antibiotic associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC) and other drug associated hemorrhagic colitis. AAHC are mainly caused by oral usage of Ampicillin and its derivatives (85%). Initially AAHC are believed to be caused by Klebsiella oxytoca overgrowth. However, these organisum has no exotoxin like Clostridium difficile and pathogenesis of AAHC are still unresolved. Typical AAHC are diagnosed by colonoscopy with diffuse hemorrhage and edema mainly found in descending colon and transverse colon. NSAIDs are also the cause of hemorrhagic colitis like AAHC. Mephenamic acid are famous for this complication. Diarrhea is one of the main complication of oral 5-fluorouracil administration and even causes hemorrhagic colitis. Its histology are characteristic in gland atrophy. Gold colitis are reported 36 cases in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Exact mechanism of bleeding are not understood. NSAIDs may cause collagenous colitis and or lymphocytic colitis in RA patients. Other rare hemorrhagic colitis are associated with azathioprine, methyl dopa, interferon alfa etc. NSAIDs and anticoagulants are well known drugs for complication of GI bleeding making hemorrhagic enteritis.
TI  - [Value of proctosigmoidoscopy with bacteriological culture of colonic biopsies in the etiological diagnosis of post-antibiotic acute diarrhea in adults. Prospective study in 24 patients].
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the interest of proctosigmoidoscopy and biopsies microbiology in antibiotic-associated acute diarrhea in adults. Between February 1993 and October 1995, we have studied prospectively 24 patients with antibiotic-associated acute diarrhea. Ages ranged from 17 to 83 years. They had taken antibiotics: amoxicillin (n = 8) amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 11), cephalosporinia (n = 3), cotrimoxazole (n = 1), macrolide (n = 1). For each patient, 2 stool cultures with Cytotoxin assay for Clostridium difficile and 3 fecal samples for parasitic enteropathogens were collected. Proctosigmoidoscopy with biopsies microbiology was carried out in all patients. Stool culture was always negative but colonic biopsies cultures were positive with Klebsiella oxytoca in 7 patients. Cytotoxin assay of C. difficile was positive in 11 patients. Proctosigmoidoscopy permitted also diagnosis of 2 pseudomembranous colitis without cytotoxin assay of C. difficile. Proctosigmoidoscopy permitted diagnosis of 83% of antibiotic-associated acute diarrhea. Complementary to Cytotoxin assay of C. difficile, it should be necessary in antibiotic-associated acute diarrhea in adults.
TI  - [Value of rectosigmoidoscopy with bacteriological culture of colonic biopsies in  the diagnosis of post-antibiotic hemorrhagic colitis related to Klebsiella oxytoca].
AB  - We report 7 cases of antibiotic-associated and hemorrhagic colitis due to Klebsiella oxytoca. The diagnosis was performed by sigmoidoscopy with bacteriological biopsy culture. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, aged 25-83 years, were hospitalized from February 1993 to October 1995 with hemorrhagic acute diarrhea following antibiotic treatment: amoxicillin (n = 3). amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 4), cephalosporine (n = 2). All patients have had two stool samples cultures including Clostridium difficile toxin detection. Sigmoidoscopy with collection of biopsy specimens for bacteriological cultures was performed routinely. RESULTS: Endoscopic findings established the diagnosis of colitis in all cases: rectitis (n = 1), diffuse left colitis (n = 4), segmental left colitis (n = 4). The lesions were erythematous and purpuric (n = 5) or ulcerative (n = 4). Stool culture was normal in all cases but Klebsiella oxytoca was isolated in 7 cases (78%). CONCLUSIONS: Sigmoidoscopy and bioptic microbiology ensured the diagnosis of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis due to Klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  - [Effect of meropenem on fecal flora in children].
AB  - Meropenem (MEPM, SM-7338), a novel parenteral carbapenem antibiotic, was examined for its effect on intestinal flora in children. Seven children with infectious diseases (3 male and 4 female children of age's ranging from 4 months to 8 years and 9 months weighing from 7.3 to 23.0 kg) were treated with MEPM at doses ranging 10.3 to 40.5 mg/kg 3 or 4 times a day for 6 to 12 days. Before, during and after the treatment, identities and numbers of various bacteria contained in 1 g of feces were determined and fecal beta-lactamase activity and Clostridium difficile D-1 antigen were also assayed. Changes in fecal flora during MEPM treatment was somewhat different depending on cases. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae among aerobes, all of 7 cases exhibited moderate or pronounced reductions in Escherichia coli. Some of the cases exhibited the tendency to increase in Klebsiella oxytoca. Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii. E. coli which was reduced during the treatment increased rapidly after the treatment in 5 out of 7 cases, and the initial bacterial counts were restored. Diverse strains were observed within the genus Enterococcus, while the overall bacterial counts of this genus exhibited the tendency to increase during the treatment. As a result, no significant change in total aerobe count was observed in any case except 1 case where Enterococcus count was somewhat reduced. Among anaerobes, major bacteria such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and Peptococcaceae exhibited tendencies to decrease in some cases during the antibiotic treatment. Two infants and 1 child exhibited significant decreases in total anaerobe counts. In most of the cases, such changes in major anaerobes were transient and bacterial counts recovered to their initial values rapidly after completion of the treatment. In no cases, glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli or fungus became predominant. Although C. difficile D-1 antigen was observed in 4 cases, its changes had no relationship with characteristics of feces. C. difficile was not detected in any of the cases. MEPM was detected in feces in 4 cases being treatment, in concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 66.0 micrograms/g. Fecal MEPM levels were very low except in 1 case in which beta-lactamase was negative. From these results, effects of MEPM on intestinal flora in children were relatively minor compared to other new beta-lactam drugs. However, a care should be taken to minimize diarrhea and bacterial turnover when a prolonged use of the antibiotic, was practiced because of potential significant effects on intestinal flora.
TI  - Review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/mL; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/mL; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/mL) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. Among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. For anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including Clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Eubacterium. The activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. In these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and C. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  - [The absorption, excretion and influence on bowel flora of oral paromomycin sulfate (author's transl)].
AB  - The absorption, excretion and influence on bowel flora of oral paromomycin sulfate (aminosidine, PRM) were studied in ten normal volunteers taking a normal diet, and the following results were obtained. 1. Serum levels of PRM were observed 0.46 micrograms/ml at a half hour, 1.14 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 1.48 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 0.70 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, 0.29 micrograms at 6 hours and were almost faded out at 12 hours after 4 grams of oral administration. 2. During 0 approximately 2 hours, 2 approximately 4 hours, 4 approximately 6 hours and 6 approximately 12 hours, the mean urine concentration of PRM were observed 56.4 micrograms/ml, 56.2 micrograms/ml, 37.1 micrograms/ml and 13.8 micrograms/ml, respectively, and the total excretion in the urine by 12 hours were observed 21.14 mg (0.53%). 3. Oral administration of PRM caused fall in Lactobacillus, non spore-forming anaerobic Gram positive bacilli (BEP group) and Peptostreptococcus (P less than 0.001), Bacteroides (P less than 0.01). However, after administration was discontinued, reduced bowel flora was returned to the normal range within a few days. No overgrowth of bowel flora by coliform, Clostridium or yeast was observed. Klebsiella oxytoca and toxigenic Clostridium difficile were not observed overgrowth. 4. No side effect was observed clinically over 2 months.
